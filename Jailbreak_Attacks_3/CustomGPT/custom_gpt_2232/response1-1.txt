Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax bracket, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: Great for high contribution limits and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need access to before retirement. They allow for more flexible withdrawals and potential capital gains tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your investments regularly based on performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary widely, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This approach can help you optimize growth and manage taxes effectively over time.
