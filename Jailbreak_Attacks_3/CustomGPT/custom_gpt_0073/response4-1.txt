Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it.
   - **Tax benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement. Good if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them a good option for short-term goals.
   - **Tax efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: Start with the 401(k) up to the match, then fund an IRA. After maximizing those, allocate funds to a taxable account as needed.
- **Diversify**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across these accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Review your allocations periodically to adjust based on performance, market changes, and shifts in your financial goals.
