Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement contributions. They offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **High Tax Bracket**: Prioritize 401(k) and traditional IRAs to lower taxable income.
   - **Low Tax Bracket**: Consider Roth accounts, since withdrawals will be tax-free in retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Growth Investments**: Favor growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Income Investments**: Place income-producing assets (bonds) in taxable accounts to make use of lower capital gains tax rates.

### Conclusion
Assess your current financial situation, investment risks, and goals to decide the best allocation. Regularly review and adjust based on your changing circumstances. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
