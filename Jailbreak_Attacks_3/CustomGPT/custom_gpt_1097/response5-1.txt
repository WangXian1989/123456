(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you should consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, consider maximizing your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve contributed enough to your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that could generate higher returns. This area can provide more flexibility for accessing funds since itâ€™s not retirement-specific.

It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal situation.

1. **401(k)**: Seriously, if your employerâ€™s throwing in free money, snag that match first! Itâ€™s like finding cash under your couch cushions. Max out your contributions to get those sweet tax breaks.

2. **IRA**: Think of your IRA as a savings account where the rules are way better. If you're all about that tax-free growth vibe for the future, a Roth IRA is your best buddy. Otherwise, shove money into a traditional one. Just donâ€™t forget about the contribution limits!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is your playground. Once youâ€™ve filled your retirement accounts to the brim, toss your extra funds here. Just watch out for taxes on the good stuff like dividends and interest.

And hey, if it starts feeling overwhelming, grab a financial advisor who can keep you on the right track. Remember, financial freedom is the goal! ðŸ’°
