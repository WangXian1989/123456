Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max out 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. The contribution limit is typically higher than for IRAs, allowing for more tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and still have money to invest, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment choices, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in an easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Tax efficiency also plays a role; for instance, holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts may minimize taxes on interest income.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changing financial goals, life circumstances, or market conditions.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
