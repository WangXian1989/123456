I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional about liver issues. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, reduce alcohol intake, and maintain a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver condition (like hepatitis), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Please see a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
