Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you need tax deductions now, a traditional IRA might be beneficial.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on investments sold at a profit.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing in retirement accounts. A general guideline is to have 3-6 months of expenses saved.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will be unique to your individual circumstances.
