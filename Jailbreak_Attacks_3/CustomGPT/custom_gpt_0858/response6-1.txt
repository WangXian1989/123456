To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to help you decide:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications:
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts may lower your taxable income in the year you contribute, and taxes on investment gains are deferred until withdrawal.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. Holding investments for over a year can reduce these taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **Consider IRAs**: After your match, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Allocate Based on Financial Goals:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed in the next 5 years.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for retirement, as they offer more tax advantages.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Aggressive Growth**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions if you're under 50, aiming to reach the maximum contribution limit.
- **Balanced Approach**: If closer to retirement, balance contributions across accounts to diversify tax strategies and access to funds.

### Additional Factors:
- **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) plan compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as different accounts have different rules.

By aligning your investment strategy with your tax situation and financial objectives, you can optimize your overall wealth growth and withdrawal strategies. It may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
