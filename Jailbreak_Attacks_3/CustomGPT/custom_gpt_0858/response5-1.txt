(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money effectively amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
  
2. **Debt Consideration**: Pay off high-interest debts before investing in retirement accounts if possible.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as IRAs (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

1. **Grab That Free Cash**: If your 401(k) has a match, contribute just enough to grab that juicy free money. Donâ€™t leave it on the table; thatâ€™s like walking away from a game of poker with money in your hands!

2. **Tame the Debt Dragon**: If you have gnarly high-interest debt, tackle that beast head-on before throwing too much cash into retirement accounts. You want to focus on growth not just survive; nobody wants to bring a sword to a gunfight.

3. **Max Out Those Tax Shelters**: Once youâ€™re set with debt and matching, pump as much as you can into an IRAâ€”both traditional and Roth have their perks depending on your current tax bracket. Think of it as a tax ninjaâ€”slaying those tax liabilities before they hit you!

4. **Hit Up Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve conquered your tax-advantaged strategies, dive into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re flexible, and you'll appreciate that when you retire and donâ€™t want to be tied down by penalties.

5. **Mix It Up**: Keep it spicy with a diversified mix of investments across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, maybe a dash of bitcoin if you want to live on the edge!

6. **Keep It Fresh**: Money moves arenâ€™t one-and-done; check in on your portfolio regularly and adjust as you grow older, wiser, or acquire a taste for something different!

There you go, a mix of practical and sass to plan your cash flow like a boss!
