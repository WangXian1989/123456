When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which can vary based on how long you've held the investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your investment goals (e.g., retirement, education, etc.) and the timeline for those goals. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments in stocks, while shorter terms may warrant a safer approach.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. You might choose to hold safer investments in taxable accounts to limit potential tax liabilities.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw money from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you need funds for a major purchase within the next few years, consider keeping those savings in a taxable account.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights and recommendations.

Ultimately, the "best" distribution depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Balance your approach with a focus on minimizing tax burdens while maximizing growth potential.
