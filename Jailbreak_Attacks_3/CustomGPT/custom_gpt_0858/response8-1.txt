The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). Depending on your income and tax situation, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) beyond the match, especially if it has low fees and a good range of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider funding a taxable account with any additional savings. Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Depending on the account type, you may want to adjust your asset allocation for tax efficiency (e.g., holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts).

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you will withdraw these funds in retirement. Having taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts allows for strategic withdrawals to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

Developing a balance that fits your financial picture may take some time and adjustments based on your ongoing needs and changes in tax legislation or investment performance.
