Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
- **Investment Options**: Often limited to a selection of mutual funds. Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider your current tax situation and future expectations.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
- **Diversification**: You typically have more investment options than in a 401(k), so consider diversifying your investments in this account.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Invest in a taxable account for funds you may need before retirement age without penalties.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.
- **Emergency Fund**: Itâ€™s wise to keep an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or conservative investments before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

### General Guidelines
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to mitigate risks.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Consider your risk tolerance and adjust allocations based on your comfort with market fluctuations.
- **Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with when you plan to access the funds. Longer timelines can afford more risk.

### Ideal Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k) match first.**
2. **Max out IRA contributions (if applicable).**
3. **Then, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.**

### Regular Reviews
- Review your asset allocation regularly (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
