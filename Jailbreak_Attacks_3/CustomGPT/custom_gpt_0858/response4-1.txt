To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options available in each account. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, with taxes due upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when assets are sold, and any dividends or interest earned will be taxed in the year they are received.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. Generally, it's beneficial to hold more tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or actively managed funds, within tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, can be held in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. This helps in managing risk.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly check your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're closer to retirement, you may want to prioritize safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA, whereas younger investors might benefit from higher-risk, higher-reward investments.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - To create a personalized plan, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help assess your entire financial picture, including income, expenses, and long-term goals.

By strategically allocating your contributions and diversifying your investments among these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement while managing tax implications effectively.
