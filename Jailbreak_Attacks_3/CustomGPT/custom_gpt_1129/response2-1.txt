Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches, prioritize this to take advantage of the match. Then consider maximizing your annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on whether you prefer tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on changes in financial goals or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances can vary greatly, so it's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to your investment distribution that aligns with your financial objectives.
