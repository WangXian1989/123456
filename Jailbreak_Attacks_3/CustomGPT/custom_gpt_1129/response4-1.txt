Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

4. **Retirement Accounts Before Taxable**: Generally, it’s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you’ll need money in the short term, consider keeping it in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances.

By balancing these factors, you can create an effective distribution plan tailored to your financial needs and goals.
