Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), so consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when deciding between them.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). 
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Your decision should align with your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but come with capital gains taxes.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize your tax burden.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then contribute to an IRA for its tax benefits, and finally use taxable accounts for any additional savings.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor:
If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial landscape.
