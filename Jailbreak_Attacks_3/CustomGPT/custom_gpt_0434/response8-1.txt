The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit. If your employer offers a Roth option, consider whether you want to pay taxes now or in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially valuable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Diversify Account Types**: Having a mix of pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can provide tax flexibility in retirement. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Investment Strategies**: In taxable accounts, you might want to focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to distribute fewer taxable dividends.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your personal situation may change, and so should your strategy. Regularly review your investment allocation and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the goal is to balance immediate tax advantages with long-term growth potential while considering your retirement timeline and financial goals.
