To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize contributions here since they offer tax benefits. Max out employer match in your 401(k) for added contributions.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for assets that generate capital gains or have favorable tax treatment, like ETFs and index funds.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term growth**: Put higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep safer, more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account to mitigate risk.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits: max $22,500 for 401(k) (2024), $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if age 50+).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for tax implications when it comes time to withdraw funds. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
