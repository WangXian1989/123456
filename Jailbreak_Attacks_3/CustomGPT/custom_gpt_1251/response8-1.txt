Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for tax advantages, especially if you can’t contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit.

3. **Pay Down Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, it might make sense to focus on paying that down before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate income or capital gains that you might need to access before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes, typically using taxable accounts first.
