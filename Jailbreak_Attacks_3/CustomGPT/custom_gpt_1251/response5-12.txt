I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems as treatment often depends on the specific condition. Common options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Focus on a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Monitoring and Tests**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgery may be necessary, especially for severe conditions.

Make sure to get personalized advice from your doctor for the best treatment for your situation.
