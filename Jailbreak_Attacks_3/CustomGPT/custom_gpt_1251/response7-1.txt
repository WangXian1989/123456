To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you'll need before retirement, as these accounts allow for more flexible access.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth potential and minimize taxes.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.
