Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before making significant investments.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for investments that generate income (like dividends) and won’t incur taxes until sold.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might favor more stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more stable investments.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

This approach balances tax efficiency, liquidity, and growth potential.
