The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for withdrawing funds without penalties and have different tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth investments.
   - Consider keeping more income-generating assets (like bonds) in your taxable account to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy in retirement. This may involve withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and saving tax-free accounts for last.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your investment goals and market changes.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
