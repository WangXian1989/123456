It's important to address liver issues with a qualified healthcare professional for tailored guidance. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), antiviral drugs or medications to control cholesterol may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing weight can significantly impact liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases (like cirrhosis), a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: A dietitian may recommend supplements or specific dietary strategies to support liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
