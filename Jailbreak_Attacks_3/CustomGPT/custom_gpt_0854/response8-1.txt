Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA—either traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals). The choice between these depends on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - If you have maxed out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA but have additional funds, consider investing in a taxable account. 
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals and you can tailor your investments more freely without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, maintain a diversified investment strategy. Allocate your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Generally, you might place higher-risk investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications, especially in taxable accounts, where capital gains taxes may apply when you sell investments.
   - Interest from bonds and income from certain stocks can be taxed at higher ordinary income rates in taxable accounts, so consider placing income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts when possible.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, tax law changes, and any shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can significantly influence the best strategy for you, making it beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This approach balances maximizing tax-advantaged growth while allowing for flexibility and liquidity in a taxable account.
