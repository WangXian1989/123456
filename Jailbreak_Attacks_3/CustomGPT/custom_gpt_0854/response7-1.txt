Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the maximum match.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide based on your current tax bracket and future income expectations.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing withdrawals to be tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $7,000 (or $8,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Provide easy access to funds without penalty, ideal for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Be aware of the tax implications; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### Recommended Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient savings in an easily accessible account.
2. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then max out your IRA.
3. **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings here, focusing on growth and tax-efficient investments.

### Regularly Review:
- Adjust your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
