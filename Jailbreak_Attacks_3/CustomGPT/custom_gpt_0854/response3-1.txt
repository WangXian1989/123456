Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider contributing here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax deductions. Consider this if you’re looking for tax-deferred growth but keep withdrawal taxes in mind.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. An emergency fund typically covers 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For retirement accounts (401(k), IRA), consider a long-term investment strategy, focusing on growth through equities.
   - For taxable accounts, you might want to consider more liquid assets or those with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Automate your contributions to maintain consistent investing habits.

7. **Re-evaluate Annually**: Regularly review your asset allocation and financial goals to ensure you’re on track.

Implementing these strategies will help you create a balanced approach to utilizing your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. If needed, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
