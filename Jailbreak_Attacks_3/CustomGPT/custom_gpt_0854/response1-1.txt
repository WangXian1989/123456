Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future tax expectations.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRAs. Ensure you are maximizing these limits if possible.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with high taxable distributions (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to minimize tax impact.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) or for short-term goals since they can be accessed easily without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts. This allows you to take advantage of different growth opportunities and risks.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account separate from your investment accounts, generally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your entire financial picture, consider speaking with a financial advisor.
