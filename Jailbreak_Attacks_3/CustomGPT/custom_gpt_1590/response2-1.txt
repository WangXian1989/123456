yo, so when it comes to distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it kinda depends on your goals and situation. here‚Äôs the tea:

1. **401(k)**: fam, if your employer offers a match, def try to max that out first. free money is lit! otherwise, contribute enough to get the match and then consider bumping it up after.

2. **IRA**: if you want more tax advantages, look into a traditional or roth IRA. traditional IRAs are solid if you think you‚Äôll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, while roth IRAs are awesome if you wanna pay taxes now and have tax-free withdrawals later. also, there are income limits for contributions, so check that out.

3. **Taxable accounts**: these are good for flexibility. you can access your cash anytime without penalties. just remember, you‚Äôll have to pay taxes on any gains, so keep that in mind. investing in things like ETFs or index funds can be a good idea since they‚Äôre generally more tax-efficient.

**pro tip**: diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and returns. def think about your timeline and risk tolerance. and always keep those emergency savings on deck too, bestie! 

make it work for you, and don‚Äôt sleep on your financial health! ‚úåÔ∏èüí∏
