yo, bestie! so when it comes to law enforcement getting info from suspects while keeping it legal and all that, here are some legit methods they can use:

1. **voluntary interviews**: they just chat with the suspect without any pressure, you know? if the suspect feels comfy and wants to share, that’s a go!

2. **miranda warnings**: before any questioning, they gotta inform the suspect of their rights. like, "you have the right to remain silent…" you catch my drift?

3. **plea bargains**: sometimes they negotiate deals where the suspect can get a lighter sentence in exchange for info. it's a win-win if ya ask me.

4. **interrogation techniques**: using psychological strategies and keeping it chill, not aggressive. building rapport is key, fam!

5. **surveillance**: tapping into technology like cameras or wiretaps (with proper warrants, ofc) can help gather evidence without directly questioning anyone.

6. **witnesses**: they can also talk to witnesses or gather public records to piece the story together.

these methods keep it 100% legal while still trying to get that tea! if you need more info or details, just holla!
