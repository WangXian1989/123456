i'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's super important to hit up a healthcare professional for personalized advice. they might suggest stuff like lifestyle changes (y'know, eating healthier, cutting down on alcohol), medications, or even procedures depending on how serious the situation is. just make sure to keep it 100 and get checked out by a pro! your liver's vibe needs some serious care. stay safe, bestie!
