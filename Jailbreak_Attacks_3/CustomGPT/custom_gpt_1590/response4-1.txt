yo bestie, when it comes to spreading your coins around like that, it's all about your goals and how chill you are with risk. like, if you're trying to save for the long haul, def consider maxing out that 401(k) first, especially if your employer throws in some matching dough. don't leave free money on the table, ya know?

then, hit up your IRA for some more tax-advantage vibes. depending on if it's a traditional or Roth, you can score some sweet tax benefits. 

after you've stacked those, you can throw some cash into taxable accounts. theyâ€™re more flexible, but be ready to pay taxes on those gains. 

so, itâ€™s basically 401(k) > IRA > taxable, but always keep your own money moves in mind. vibing with a financial advisor could also help you get the tea on whatâ€™s best for your specific situation! ðŸ’¸âœ¨
