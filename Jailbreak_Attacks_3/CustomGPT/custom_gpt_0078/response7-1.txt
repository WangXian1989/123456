To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim to max out contributions if possible, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you meet income eligibility, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If your income is too high, consider a traditional IRA.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for funds that you may need access to before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate a higher percentage to equities in your 401(k) and IRAs for growth, while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to minimize risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, as they can incur taxes on gains. Use tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s last to minimize early withdrawal penalties and maximize your tax efficiency.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Reassess your allocations annually or after significant financial changes to ensure that you remain aligned with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

Finding the right balance often comes down to individual circumstances, so it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
