To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first. Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, like stocks, due to potential employer matching and tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that may benefit from tax-free growth, like Roth IRAs for qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for investments with favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your accounts with your financial goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for retirement, and taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes within each account to manage risk effectively.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged contributions and aligning them with your financial goals, you can optimize your investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
