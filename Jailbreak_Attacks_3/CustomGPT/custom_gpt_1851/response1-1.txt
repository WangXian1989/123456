To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match available. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to reach the maximum limit for 2023, which is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. The 2023 contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).
   - Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need before retirement, or for investments that offer tax advantages. 
   - Consider holding investments like stocks for long-term growth, which can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates over time.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to balance risk and return according to your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement, generally withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Regularly review your allocations to adjust for market changes and personal circumstances.
