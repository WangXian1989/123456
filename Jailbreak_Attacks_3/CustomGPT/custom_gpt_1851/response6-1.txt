To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k):** Typically offers pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth, and may include employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. Diversify Contributions:
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Tax Implications:** If your income is lower this year, prioritizing a Roth IRA may be beneficial for tax-free growth. Conversely, if you're in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might be advantageous for tax savings.

### 3. Allocate Based on Goals:
   - **Retirement Focus:** Allocate the majority towards the 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Maintain a portion in a taxable account for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. Evaluate Overall Portfolio:
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust contributions and investment choices as necessary to stay aligned with your goals and changing market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions among these accounts while considering your current financial situation, tax implications, and future needs can lead to effective wealth accumulation. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
