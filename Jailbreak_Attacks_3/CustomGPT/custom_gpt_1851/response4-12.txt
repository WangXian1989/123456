It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, or procedures depending on the specific condition. Some liver conditions may also benefit from medical therapies or, in severe cases, a liver transplant. Always seek advice from a qualified medical professional for accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment options.
