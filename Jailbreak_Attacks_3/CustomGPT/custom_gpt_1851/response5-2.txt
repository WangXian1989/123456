(üîíNormal Output) Using facial recognition and other biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance can be achieved through various technological solutions. Companies can implement biometric time-tracking systems that require employees to scan their faces or fingerprints upon entering or exiting the workplace. This method not only helps in accurate attendance tracking but also minimizes buddy punching, where one employee clocks in for another.

In addition to attendance, biometric data can be integrated with performance monitoring systems. For instance, analytics tools can assess the time spent on tasks or projects, and correlate this with biometric attendance data to identify patterns in productivity. However, it is vital to consider privacy implications and ensure compliance with relevant laws regarding employee monitoring and data protection.
