Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions can also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be more favorable long-term if you hold investments for over a year.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies. This might mean keeping some funds in your taxable account.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, put higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to potentially maximize tax benefits.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on your long-term financial goals. If retirement is far off, you might lean more heavily into your 401(k) and IRAs. As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
