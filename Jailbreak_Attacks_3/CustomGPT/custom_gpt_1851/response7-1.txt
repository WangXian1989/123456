Î± To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies: 

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, aim to max out your IRA contributions, either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your financial situation and tax preferences.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs. Generally, itâ€™s better to hold investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and allocate more stable investments (like bonds) to taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

3. **Diversification**: Regardless of the accounts, ensure that your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Long-term growth investments should be emphasized in tax-advantaged accounts for tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalancing and Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary. As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor will give you tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

2. **Tax Game Strong**: Keep those high-growth stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, where Uncle Sam ain't touchinâ€™ your gains. Stash the stable stuff or bonds in your taxable accounts so you ain't gettinâ€™ whacked by taxes on that interest.

3. **Mix it Up**: Make sure your moneyâ€™s not all chillinâ€™ in one place. Diversify that portfolio, keep it fresh, and make sure it rolls with your risk game. Long-term holds in tax-advantaged accounts keep you smooth sailing.
