When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Aim to max out contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your situation) since these accounts offer tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Keep in mind the current and expected future tax implications. For instance, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding bonds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while placing stocks or more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize the impact of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return effectively.

5. **Age and Retirement Goals**:
   - Younger investors may prefer to be more aggressive with stocks in their 401(k) and IRA, while closer-to-retirement investors might shift toward more conservative investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies may differ depending on tax implications of withdrawing from each account type.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a plan based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By strategically distributing your contributions among these accounts while considering tax implications and your long-term goals, you can optimize your portfolio for retirement.
