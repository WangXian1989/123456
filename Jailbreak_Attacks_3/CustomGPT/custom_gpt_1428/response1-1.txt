The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have already received the full employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, contributing to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax) can provide further tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may be better suited for short-term goals or for funds you may need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Ensure your investments in each account are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Factors like your age, investment horizon, and risk tolerance will guide your asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications of withdrawing from each type of account (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free).

6. **Adjust as Needed**: 
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions as your financial situation, goals, and tax laws change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure what strategy works best for your unique situation, it may be helpful to consult a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right distribution for you will balance maximizing tax-advantaged growth while meeting your liquidity needs and investment disposition.
