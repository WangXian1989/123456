To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it’s essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. It’s ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk and improve potential returns. Keep in mind the time horizon for each account.

### 4. **Liquid Assets in Taxable Accounts**
   - Consider keeping investments with higher turnover or frequent trading in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Long-Term Perspective**
   - Focus on your long-term goals and avoid making changes based on short-term market fluctuations.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20-25% of your total savings
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: 15-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-15%
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in cash or cash equivalents.

### Final Thoughts
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation and retirement goals.
