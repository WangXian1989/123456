To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible (for 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** Next, contribute to your IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50+). This can be either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - Invest in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) should be in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account.
   - Use this for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed favorably (long-term capital gains rates).

### 4. **Consider Fees and Investment Choices**
   - Assess the fees associated with your 401(k) plan and the investment options available. Sometimes, IRAs can offer better investment choices or lower fees.
   - Be mindful of the investment choices in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient options like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This helps manage risk and can optimize returns over time.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and goals.

By strategically maximizing tax advantages, selecting appropriate investments, and maintaining flexibility, you can effectively distribute your money among these accounts.
