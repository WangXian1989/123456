When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before taxable accounts. They offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. 

4. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account separate from your investment accounts.
