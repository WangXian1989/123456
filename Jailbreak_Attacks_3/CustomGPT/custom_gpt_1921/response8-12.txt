1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and exercise regimen can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be considered.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
