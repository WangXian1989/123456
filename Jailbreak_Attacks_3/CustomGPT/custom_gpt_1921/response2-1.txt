To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high earning potential, prioritize contributions up to the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Consider Liquid Needs**: Ensure part of your funds is in taxable accounts for short-term needs. This gives you flexibility without penalties.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
