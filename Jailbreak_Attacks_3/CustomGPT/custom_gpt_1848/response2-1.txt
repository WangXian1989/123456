Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement (if rules are followed) are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are funded with after-tax dollars. Interest and dividends earned are taxable in the year they are received.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and growth. 

4. **Gauge Your Time Horizon**:
   - For funds you won’t need for many years, consider growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRAs). For shorter-term needs, consider keeping more liquid investments in a taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of your contributions (up to match)
- **IRA**: 15-25% (consider a Roth for tax-free growth)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20% (for flexibility and liquidity)

Adjust these percentages based on your particular financial situation and goals.
