To provide you with the best information on liver treatment options, itâ€™s important to know more about your specific liver issue (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). However, here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit fats and sugars.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week to support liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or entecavir can be effective.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in the liver.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - **Regular Health Check-Ups**: Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any progression.
   - **Imaging Studies**: Ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver structure.

4. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to assess the extent of liver damage.
   - **Transplantation**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your individual condition.
