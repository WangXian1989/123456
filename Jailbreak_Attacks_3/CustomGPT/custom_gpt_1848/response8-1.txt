Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including investment goals, tax implications, and personal circumstances. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA if eligible. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) can be ideal for taxable accounts. Place higher tax-burden assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan ahead for withdrawals. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize taxes in retirement.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - If you're unsure where to start or want to optimize your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This distribution strategy can help you maximize your savings and minimize taxes over time.
