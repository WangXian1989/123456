To optimize your distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. It's ideal for growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k), but has income limits for tax deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility and immediate access to funds; however, you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Put higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to avoid immediate taxes on gains.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, optimize withdrawals to minimize taxes. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Yearly Contributions**: Contribute to your accounts each year based on limits, prioritizing 401(k) and IRAs for tax advantages.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies based on your unique financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, you can maximize growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
