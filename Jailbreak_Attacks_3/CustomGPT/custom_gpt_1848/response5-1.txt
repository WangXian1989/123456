(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there's a matching contribution, as this is essentially “free money.” After that, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

Once you've maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, you can look to taxable accounts for additional investments. The ideal asset allocation also depends on your timeline and needs: tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs may be more suitable for taxable accounts, while you may want to hold bonds and equities in retirement accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
