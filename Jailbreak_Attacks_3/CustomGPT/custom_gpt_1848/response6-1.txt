Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's effectively "free money."
- **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. Understand Contribution Limits:
- **401(k)**: $22,500 for those under 50, $30,000 for 50+ in 2024.
- **IRA**: $6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for 50+ in 2024.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Situation:
- **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for more flexible withdrawal options, but capital gains tax applies. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Balance Risk and Growth:
- **401(k) and IRA**: Generally appropriate for long-term, higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Might hold more stable, income-generating investments or bonds for easier access without tax penalties.

### 5. Evaluate Your Short and Long-Term Needs:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid funds in taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your financial goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
