Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions:** 
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments generate capital gains and might be subject to taxes, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Focus on growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks in your taxable account to manage tax impacts.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** 
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on how close you are to retirement and your comfort with market fluctuations.

5. **Regular Monitoring and Rebalancing:** 
   - Review and adjust your portfolio as needed to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
