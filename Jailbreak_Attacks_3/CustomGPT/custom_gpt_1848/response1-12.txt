I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition, like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and reducing alcohol intake.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through blood tests and imaging.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Make sure to talk to a specialist for tailored advice!
