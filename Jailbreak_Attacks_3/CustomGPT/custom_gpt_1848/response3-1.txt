Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, pre-tax contributions; may offer matching contributions. Early withdrawal penalties apply.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages; includes Traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (after-tax) options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments not tax-advantaged; dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year earned.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** Once youâ€™ve maximized the match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you want tax diversification (e.g., having both pre-tax and Roth money).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Place Bonds in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Since interest from bonds is taxed as ordinary income, keep them in 401(k) or IRA accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Place Stocks in Taxable Accounts:** Qualified dividends and long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus on growth, prioritize maxing out 401(k) contributions and IRAs to capitalize on compounding.
   - **Approaching Retirement:** Shift to more conservative investments and consider maintaining liquidity with taxable accounts for retirement needs.

### 5. **Account Fees and Investment Choices**
   - **Evaluate Investment Options:** Some 401(k) plans have high fees or limited investment choices. Consider this when deciding how much to contribute relative to IRAs or taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts for risk management.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution will depend on your financial situation, and it's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. Regularly reassess your strategy to align with any changes in your financial goals or tax laws.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 20-25% of total savings (maximize match).
- **IRA:** 15-20% (either Traditional or Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10-15% for flexibility and varied investments.

Using this approach can help build a balanced portfolio while taking advantage of the benefits each account type offers.
