I'm here to help you with your book writing journey! If this is your idea, we could start by formulating a working title and outline for a book on personal finance, specifically on optimizing retirement accounts and investments.

Would you like to proceed with that? If so, we can also discuss if you want me to answer the optional questions related to your book idea.
