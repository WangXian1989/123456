It's important to consider your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place before allocating funds to investment accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

2. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to maximize that match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k), contribute the maximum amount allowed, especially if they provide matching contributions. The contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider opening an IRA to benefit from tax advantages:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but the money grows tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free if certain conditions are met.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can provide more flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes. After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for:
   - Short-term goals
   - Greater liquidity
   - Investments not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., certain bonds)

5. **Diversification:** Regardless of where you invest, ensure a diversified portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) suitable for your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique circumstances.
