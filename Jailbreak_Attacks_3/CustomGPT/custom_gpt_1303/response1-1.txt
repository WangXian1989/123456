Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After you've maxed out your IRA contributions (if possible), go back to your 401(k) and continue to contribute up to the maximum allowed limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need access to your money before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changes in life circumstances, or shifts in financial goals. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consulting with a financial planner can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your unique circumstances, so take the time to assess what's right for you!
