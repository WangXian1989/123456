Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

### 2. **Balance Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next few years. This account is more flexible for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher growth potential, as they can compound without immediate tax implications.

### Additional Tips
- **Asset Allocation**: Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains and lower-risk (like bonds) in taxable accounts where you can handle the tax implications.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient funds for your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially to take advantage of the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute enough to maximize any tax benefits (up to the limit).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings and investment once the above accounts are maxed.
