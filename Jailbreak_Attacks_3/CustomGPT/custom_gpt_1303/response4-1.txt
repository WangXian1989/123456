The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general tips:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Make sure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Tax Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider maximizing your contribution to benefit from tax deferrals.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, this can either reduce your taxable income now or provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible, allowing you to access funds without penalties. Focus on investing in assets that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

3. **Assess Your Timeline**: If you need funds in the short term, you may want to prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on retirement accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across accounts and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan how you will withdraw money in retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Depending on your financial situation, it might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By designing a balanced approach that considers your unique circumstances and goals, you'll be better positioned for successful investment outcomes.
