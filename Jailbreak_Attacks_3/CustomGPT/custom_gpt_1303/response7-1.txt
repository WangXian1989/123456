Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial if you need liquidity before retirement, as they are not subject to penalties for early withdrawal like retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding long-term investments in these accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type. This helps manage risk.

### 4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Financial Goals:**
   - If you're close to retirement, you might prioritize contributions to accounts with less liquidity.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, it may be more beneficial to prioritize accounts with higher growth potential.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Contributing to a traditional 401(k) or IRA may reduce your taxable income, which could be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

### 6. **Long-Term Planning:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential and liquidity needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
