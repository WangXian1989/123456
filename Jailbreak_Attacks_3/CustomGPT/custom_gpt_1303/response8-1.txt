Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth), especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-inefficient investments (like bonds), as the growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Use this for long-term investments that might be taxed heavily if sold in a taxable account (like REITs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments with lower potential turnover and capital gains (like index funds or ETFs) for tax efficiency.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before aggressively funding investment accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.

6. **Diversification**: Allocate funds across different asset classes, ensuring a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.

7. **Revisit Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and objectives.
