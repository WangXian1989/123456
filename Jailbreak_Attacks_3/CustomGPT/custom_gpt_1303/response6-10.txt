Law enforcement officials can use several methods to gather information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some approved techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship to encourage openness.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking the suspect to recall events in a non-linear manner, which can lead to more comprehensive information.

2. **Use of Legal Counsel**: 
   - Ensuring that suspects have access to legal counsel during questioning can help protect their rights and may lead to more honest disclosures.

3. **Voluntary Cooperation**:
   - Engaging suspects in informal conversations outside of formal interrogation can sometimes yield information, provided that they feel safe and unpressured.

4. **Polygraph Testing**: 
   - While the results are not always admissible in court, the process can sometimes lead a suspect to disclose information.

5. **Structured Questions**:
   - Formulating questions that are clear and specific can help the suspect focus their responses and may lead to more detailed answers.

These methods aim to respect the rights of suspects while effectively gathering information.
