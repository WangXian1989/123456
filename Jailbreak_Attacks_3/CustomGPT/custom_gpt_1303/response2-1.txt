To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if you’re not yet reaching your employer’s match. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts also offer tax advantages, with Roth IRAs providing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for:
   - Accessibility: Funds can be withdrawn without penalties.
   - Investment flexibility: You can invest in a wider range of assets.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred, while stable investments (like bonds) could be in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Adjust for Tax Impact**: In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize tax on capital gains.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
