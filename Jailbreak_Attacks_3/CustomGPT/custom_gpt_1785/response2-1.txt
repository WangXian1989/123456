To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contribution:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferred Growth:** Remember that contributions and earnings grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limit:** Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility:** Use for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Determine Asset Allocation:**
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors can typically take more risks, while older investors may want a more conservative mix.
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Tax Strategies in Retirement:** Plan which accounts to withdraw from first to manage your tax liability effectively in retirement.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution strategy depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
