Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider putting money into an IRA. The choice between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: These contributions are tax-deductible now, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-efficient for long-term growth due to capital gains taxes. Use these accounts for investments that might incur high taxes, like bonds or real estate.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Retirement Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Consider holding higher-growth assets like stocks, as they can benefit from the long-term tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - **Short-term Goals**: Funds in taxable accounts may be more accessible without penalties.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get full employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA (for 2023, this is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining funds can go into taxable investment accounts.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
