Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The choice between traditional and Roth often depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Funds in 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn, typically in retirement. Roth IRAs, however, allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains and dividends. They might be a good place for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Place higher growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Generating Assets**: Bonds and dividend-paying stocks might be better held in taxable accounts to manage tax implications more effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts and consider your liquidity needs before making any distributions.

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach typically involves maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, followed by strategic investments in taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
