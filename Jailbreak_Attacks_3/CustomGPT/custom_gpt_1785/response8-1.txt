Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k)): If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free" money and a good return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Consider maxing this out if you qualify based on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize this if you're eligible.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts. It's also beneficial for shorter-term goals since you can access the funds without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account, typically equal to three to six months' worth of expenses.

5. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, bonds) since they have the advantage of tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Account**: Balance your investments with a mix that aims for capital preservation and growth, considering tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your short- and long-term goals.

This approach can help you maximize growth while keeping taxes in check. Always re-evaluate your strategies as your financial situation and goals change.
