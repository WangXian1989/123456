To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Prioritize contributions to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Allocate more funds into tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth due to compounding.
   - **Shorter-term Needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can build a balanced approach that maximizes returns while minimizing your tax burden.
