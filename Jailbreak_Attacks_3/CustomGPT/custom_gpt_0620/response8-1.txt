Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. These accounts can be used for short-term goals or as an emergency fund. Consider keeping less tax-efficient investments, such as bonds or REITs, in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**: If you plan to withdraw funds in the short term, taxable accounts may be the best option, as you can avoid penalties that come with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Regularly assess your portfolio allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
