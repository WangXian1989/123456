When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, but you have more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Taxable accounts are suitable for shorter-term goals due to their liquidity, whereas IRAs and 401(k)s are geared towards retirement savings.

3. **Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're younger and further from retirement, you might prioritize growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) or IRA. As retirement nears, consider shifting to more conservative investments to protect your capital.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to these accounts before investing in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Consider a strategy for withdrawing funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to use taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially to capture any employer match), then fund an IRA (either traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation), and finally allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. 

Itâ€™s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.
