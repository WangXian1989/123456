I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Generally, treatments may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or more serious interventions like procedures or surgery in severe cases. Please reach out to a medical professional for advice tailored to your situation.
