When it comes to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are some general strategies to consider. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Max out any employer match first; it's free money!
   - Consider investing in a mix of index funds or target-date funds to balance risk and reward.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
   - If you're eligible, aim to max out your contributions here too. 
   - A Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for flexible investments or for goals within a shorter time frame since you can access your money anytime without penalties.
   - Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize retirement accounts for tax advantages, then allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.
- Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation!
