1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise, especially for conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications such as interferon or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
