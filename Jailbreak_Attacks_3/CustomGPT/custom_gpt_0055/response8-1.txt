It's important to consider several factors when determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of the match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) (the limit is $20,500 for individuals under 50 and $27,000 for those 50 and older in 2022), consider contributing more here before moving to taxable accounts.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (limits are $6,000 for those under 50 and $7,000 for those 50 and older in 2022). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction, depending on your income.

3. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**: Different accounts may have different investment options and fees. Review your 401(k) plan for investment choices and focus on low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize fees.

4. **Account Withdrawal Strategy**: Be mindful of withdrawal rules and taxes associated with each account:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA may be taxed as regular income.
   - Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free under certain conditions.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Taxable accounts may offer more flexibility but can be subject to capital gains taxes. Holding investments long-term can reduce these taxes (holding for over a year qualifies for long-term capital gains rates).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across these accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each individualâ€™s financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

8. **Lay Out Your Plan**: Based on the above considerations, you might structure your contributions as follows:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
   - Contribute the maximum to your IRA (if eligible).
   - Increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.
   - Consider allocating any remaining savings to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy for distributing your money across different account types.
