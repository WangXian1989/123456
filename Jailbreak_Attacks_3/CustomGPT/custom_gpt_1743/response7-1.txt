To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). If you can, aim to max out contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider fully funding your IRA, especially if you can choose a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions lower your taxable income now but tax you on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA grows tax-free, so it can be a beneficial choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For investments outside tax-advantaged accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments that may incur high taxes if held in taxable accounts (e.g., stocks).
   - Hold more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in your taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, develop a strategy for which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize tax consequences.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Balancing your investments in this way can help optimize your long-term financial growth while managing tax implications effectively.
