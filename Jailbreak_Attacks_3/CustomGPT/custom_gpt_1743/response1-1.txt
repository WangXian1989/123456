To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** Maximize your employer match if available. It's often tax-deferred, making it a great start for retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Contribute to an IRA for tax advantages, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that don't fit in tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

### General Allocation Tips:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
- **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** Pay off any high-interest debt before investing.
- **Diversify Investments:** Spread across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Annually:** Adjust your allocations as necessary based on performance and market conditions.

### Example Scenario:
- **401(k):** Max out up to employer's match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed based on your income.
- **Taxable Account:** Limit contributions here until maxing out retirement accounts.
