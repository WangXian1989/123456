Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you may receive tax benefits now or in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t provide tax benefits but offer flexibility in withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account (usually a savings account) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - If you’re far from retirement, you may prioritize higher-risk investments in your 401(k) or IRA for growth.
   - Closer to retirement? Consider shifting some contributions to more stable investments or taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing high-growth assets (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, which are taxed at a lower rate.

7. **Review Regularly**: Make it a practice to review your investment allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can optimize your retirement savings and overall investment strategy. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
