Generally, you might want to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if there is an employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax advantages. Any remaining funds can go into your taxable accounts, which provide flexibility in accessing your money without penalties. It's also essential to keep in mind your investment strategy and risk tolerance.
