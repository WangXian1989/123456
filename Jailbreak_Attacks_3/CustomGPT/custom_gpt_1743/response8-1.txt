To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first if your employer offers a match. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible (traditional or Roth), contribute next to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and access.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments like index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency. Avoid frequent trading to minimize capital gains.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider placing higher-growth investments here, as taxes on gains are deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account to manage risk and enhance returns.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking to a financial professional to align your strategy with your specific circumstances.

This strategy can maximize growth potential while managing taxes effectively.
