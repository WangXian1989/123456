To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred contributions, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Tax advantages depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No specific tax advantages; earnings are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals. This will influence how you allocate your assets.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Each account has different contribution limits. Make sure to maximize your employer match in the 401(k) first, then consider IRAs.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax efficiency: prioritize tax-deferred accounts for higher-income investments and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

5. **Diversify Allocations**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - Consider the time horizon for each accountâ€”long-term investments can be more aggressive.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create an investment strategy that balances growth, risk, and tax efficiency.
