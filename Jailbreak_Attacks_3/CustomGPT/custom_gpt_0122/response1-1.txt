To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out your traditional IRA or 401(k) next, as they offer tax benefits.

3. **Roth IRA Consideration**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, as these may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts for balanced risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.
