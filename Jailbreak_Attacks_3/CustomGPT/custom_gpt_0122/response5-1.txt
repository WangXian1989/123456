Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match if available, as it's essentially free money. Contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before investing heavily elsewhere.

2. **IRA**: Consider setting up a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax strategy. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs grow tax-free, but contributions are made after-tax.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as you'll be taxed on these in the current year. It's also a flexible option for funds you may need before retirement.

### Strategy
- **Prioritize**: Start with 401(k) up to the match, then fund an IRA, and finally, allocate to taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Diversify**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

### Review Regularly
Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your needs can provide personalized insight.
