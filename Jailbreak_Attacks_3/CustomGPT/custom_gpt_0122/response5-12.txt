I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems, depending on the condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For advanced liver disease, a transplant might be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
