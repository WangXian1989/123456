Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match 
If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts 
After maximizing the match, consider focusing on tax-advantaged accounts:
- **401(k):** If you have access to a well-performing 401(k) with good investment options, contribute here next, especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront.

### 3. Evaluate Taxable Accounts 
Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. Asset Allocation Strategy 
Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. Consider Withdrawals and Tax Implications 
Keep in mind that funds withdrawn from a 401(k) or traditional IRA may be taxed as ordinary income. Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax burdens.

### 6. Regularly Review and Adjust 
Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions. 

### Summary 
1. Maximize employer match in 401(k)
2. Contribute to 401(k) and IRA
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investing 
4. Diversify investments 
5. Plan for tax implications

By strategically allocating your funds, you can enhance your financial security and optimize your retirement savings.
