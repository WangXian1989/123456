Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), affecting your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you anticipate needing access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
