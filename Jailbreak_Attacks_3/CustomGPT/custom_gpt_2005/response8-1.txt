To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, which is essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions (2024 limit: $23,000, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA (2024 limit: $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+). Roth accounts grow tax-free, while Traditional contributions may be tax-deductible.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Place bonds or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they usually have higher tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This could involve different asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, and real estate.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Routinely check your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals strategically. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first during retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seeking professional advice can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and maintaining awareness of tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
