When determining how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the gains until you withdraw funds, potentially lowering your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable accounts** are subject to capital gains taxes on profits when sold, and dividends are taxed in the year they are received.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) ($30,000 if aged 50 or older) and up to $6,500 to an IRA ($7,500 if aged 50 or older).

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) at least enough to earn any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. If your 401(k) offers limited choices, consider maximizing your IRA contributions where you might have more flexibility.

5. **Time Horizon and Goals**:
   - Consider your financial goals and time horizon. If you need to access funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term growth, maxing out retirement accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk and return.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute fully to your IRA for tax advantages.
3. **Additional Contributions**: Return to your 401(k) and contribute further. If you reach the limit, consider funding a taxable account for flexibility.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
