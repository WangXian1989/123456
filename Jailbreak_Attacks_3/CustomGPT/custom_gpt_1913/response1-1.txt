Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match if available, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can lower your taxable income now or later.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Leverage this vehicle to take advantage of higher annual contribution limits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Lower than 401(k)s, so consider this if you're near the max in your 401(k).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs can offer a wider range of investment options compared to many 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Good for investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Long-term investments benefit from lower capital gains taxes. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.
   - **Diversification**: Can provide flexibility in asset allocation and investment types.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before aggressively investing.
- **Allocate by Goals**: Distribute based on near-term vs. long-term goals, keeping your timeline in mind.
- **Tax-Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Recommended Approach
- Start with maxing out the 401(k) match.
- Then, contribute to an IRA up to the limit.
- Finally, invest any remaining funds in a taxable account for flexibility.
