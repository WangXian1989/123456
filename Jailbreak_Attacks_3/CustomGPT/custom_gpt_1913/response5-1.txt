(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon until retirement. Generally, you might consider prioritizing your contributions in the following manner:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider funding your IRA. A traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, after you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and flexibility.

It's essential to analyze your overall financial situation and perhaps consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer's matching, hammer that 401(k) like itâ€™s a piÃ±ata! Get that free cash while you can. Aim for at least enough to hit the maximum matchâ€”it's a no-brainer.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, donâ€™t sleep on your IRA! Choose traditional if you want to dodge some taxes now or Roth if you prefer to skip taxes later. Consider maxing it out if you canâ€”it's like a secret stash of tax benefits!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, when youâ€™ve milked those other accounts dry, dive into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility and can be fun for short-term gains, but be wary of those tax implications!

In the end, balance it based on your goals and risk tolerance. And hey, maybe chat with a financial advisor to fine-tune your game plan!
