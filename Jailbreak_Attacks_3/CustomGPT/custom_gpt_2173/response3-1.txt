The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make the most of your investments:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:  
   - 401(k): For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Traditional/Roth IRA: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Taxable Accounts: There are no contribution limits, but investment earnings will be subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:  
   If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Benefits**:  
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Diversify Investments**:  
   Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:  
   Before heavily investing, consider paying down high-interest debt, which can provide a guaranteed return on investment.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:  
   - Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prioritize more stable investments.
   - Adjust the allocation between accounts based on when youâ€™ll need funds. Short-term savings might go into a taxable account, whereas long-term savings can be channeled into retirement accounts.

7. **Systematic Contribution Plans**:  
   Consider setting up automatic contributions to each account type according to your budget and wealth-building strategy.

8. **Review Regularly**:  
   Make it a habit to review your portfolio periodically (at least annually) and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

By carefully planning your distributions among these accounts, you can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing tax liabilities. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
