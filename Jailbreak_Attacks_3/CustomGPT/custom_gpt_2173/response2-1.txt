The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contribution Limits:**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you can. Depending on your income, you might opt for a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA.

2. **Asset Allocation:**  
   - Traditional wisdom suggests keeping tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow without being taxed until withdrawal.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to avoid higher taxes in tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**  
   - Higher-income individuals might benefit from contributing more to tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or a traditional IRA, which can lower their taxable income.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Investment Horizon:**  
   - If you have a long time horizon, consider being more aggressive with your investments in retirement accounts. As you get closer to retirement, you may want to reallocate to more conservative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**  
   - Keep an eye on your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**  
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from these accounts, which can affect your tax situation in retirement.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**  
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so it's important to tailor these guidelines to fit your personal financial landscape.
