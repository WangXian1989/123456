To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding your taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexible access to your money since you can withdraw funds without penalties (though you will incur taxes on any gains).

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities have higher growth potential, while bonds can provide stability. Each account type may serve different asset allocation needs. For instance, you might take a more aggressive approach in your retirement accounts and a more conservative stance in your taxable account to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications associated with each account type. For instance, it may be beneficial to hold tax-efficient funds in your taxable account while placing bonds (which generate ordinary income) in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct annual reviews to adjust contributions and rebalance asset allocation as necessary, especially as your financial situation changes. 

Overall, the best distribution depends on your personal financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
