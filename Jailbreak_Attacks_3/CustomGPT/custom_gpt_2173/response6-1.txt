Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Growth Potential:** The 401(k) can grow tax-deferred, which is advantageous for long-term savings.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Depending on your income, contributing to a Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income. Alternatively, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** This account adds an additional layer of tax strategy to your retirement savings.

### 3. **Fund Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** If you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in the short term.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) that generate lower capital gains distributions to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Balance Your Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your investment allocations are appropriately balanced across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

### 5. **Consider Future Tax Implications:**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account during retirement, as this can affect your tax rate in retirement.
   - **Tax Bracket Management:** Aim to manage your taxable income to stay within lower tax brackets, utilizing your 401(k) and IRA strategically.

### Conclusion:
Assess your financial situation regularly and adjust your contribution strategy as necessary. Consulting with a financial planner can also provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
