Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments. These accounts offer more flexibility.

### 3. **Assess Growth Potential**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Invest in higher-risk assets (like stocks) within your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth. Utilize a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in taxable accounts based on your risk profile.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impact. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts to optimize your tax situation.

### Conclusion
This distribution strategy aims to balance growth potential with tax efficiency. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
