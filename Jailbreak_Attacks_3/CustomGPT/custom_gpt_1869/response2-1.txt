Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize growth and minimize taxes. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Prioritize maxing out this account after your 401(k) match.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions (tax-free withdrawals).
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial for immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these usually have lower tax rates than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on that income.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where capital gains taxes may apply.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before investing heavily. This can prevent you from needing to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts prematurely and incurring penalties.

### Conclusion:
Assess your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals to determine the right distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
