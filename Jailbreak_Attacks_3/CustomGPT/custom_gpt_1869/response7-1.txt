To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs being tax-deferred and Roth IRAs providing tax-free growth and withdrawals (given specific conditions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible to access without penalties, but subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Fund IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred savings.
   - **Next, Contribute to 401(k)**: If you've maximized your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on investments with potential for high returns or those that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More suitable for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and retirement goals. Use this to guide your allocation within each account type.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

### General Distribution Strategy Example:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match—up to 15% or max limit as applicable.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible—$6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining savings, focusing on low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach, prioritizing accounts based on employer benefits and tax implications, will enhance your retirement readiness. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
