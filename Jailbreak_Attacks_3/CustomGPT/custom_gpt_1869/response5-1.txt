Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - Consider using it for long-term growth investments, as contributions grow tax-deferred.
   - Be mindful of fees associated with your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - A Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits; consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Tips**
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes to manage risk.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.
- **Understand Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals, especially for taxable accounts.
