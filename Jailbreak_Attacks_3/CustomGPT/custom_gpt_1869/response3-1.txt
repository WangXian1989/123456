Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Ideal for long-term growth since taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds. Capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Allocate a larger portion to growth investments (like stocks) if you're investing for the long term (20+ years). 
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments (like bonds).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This means a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to reduce risk.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your personal situation. This helps maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 30% (plus enough to get the full match)
- **IRA**: 20% (split between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation)
- **Taxable accounts**: 50% (with a focus on long-term growth)

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that fits your specific circumstances and retirement goals.
