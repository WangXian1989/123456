The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. The 401(k) may also have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA(s), consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties at any time, but be aware of capital gains taxes.

**Considerations**:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure youâ€™re diversifying your investments within each account type.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund separate from these investments.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and goals.
