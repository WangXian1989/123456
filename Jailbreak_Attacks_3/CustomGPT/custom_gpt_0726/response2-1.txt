The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to the 401(k) up to the maximum allowed limit if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income level, you may qualify for a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - Contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Consider the contribution limits set by the IRS for both traditional and Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that will not benefit significantly from tax-advantaged treatment.
   - Ideal for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that produce more capital gains than ordinary income (like stocks).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - A common strategy is to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and less volatile investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

It's always a good practice to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique situation.
