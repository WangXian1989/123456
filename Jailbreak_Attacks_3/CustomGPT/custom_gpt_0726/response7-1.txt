It's essential to have a strategic approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize for growth, tax efficiency, and retirement planning. Here's a methodical breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to receive any employer matching contribution as itâ€™s effectively free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth: A 401(k) allows your investments to grow tax-deferred until you withdraw in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Max out contributions: If eligible, try to contribute the maximum allowed to benefit from the tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest for flexibility: Utilize taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of taxes: Focus on long-term capital gains to minimize tax implications. Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting.

**General Distribution Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to a 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund your IRA accounts, focusing on maximizing tax benefits. Lastly, allocate any additional funds into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

**Asset Allocation Considerations**:
- Assess risk tolerance and time horizon to determine appropriate asset allocation within each account type. It is generally recommended to hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your specific financial situation and goals.
