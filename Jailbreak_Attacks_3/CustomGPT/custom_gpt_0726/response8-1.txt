When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, there are several factors to keep in mind, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a general approach to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to maximize this match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing to the maximum allowed if you're in a higher tax bracket and want to reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) and a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal). Your choice may depend on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs and prioritize making the maximum contribution if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Investments in taxable accounts provide more access and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments in these accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts rather than concentrating specific investments in one type of account. This can help manage risk more effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your future withdrawal needs. If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep a portion in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure you remain aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Prioritizing contributions to take advantage of employer matches and maximizing tax-advantaged accounts is generally a sound strategy.
