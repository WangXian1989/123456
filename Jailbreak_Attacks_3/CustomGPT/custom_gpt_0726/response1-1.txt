To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw the funds in retirement. Prioritize these for tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. They can be better suited for shorter-term goals or if you might need liquid funds before retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts so that you won’t need to withdraw from them prematurely.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments, such as a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments like index funds, ETFs, or tax-exempt municipal bonds.

5. **Age Considerations**: As you get closer to retirement (typically over 50), you may want to shift a larger portion of your savings into less risky investments within your retirement accounts while maintaining growth potential in your taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Ensure you’re making regular contributions to each account, adjusting as necessary based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation annually to adjust for changes in your life circumstances or market performance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By taking these factors into account, you can create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your financial future.
