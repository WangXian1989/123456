(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment preferences. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before focusing on other accounts.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: IRAs (especially Roth IRAs) offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties and can be useful for shorter-term goals. However, they may be less tax-efficient compared to tax-advantaged accounts.
4. **Balance Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments and hold more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.
5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing financial circumstances and goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so you want to play the money game? Let's strategize like a boss. Hereâ€™s the lowdown on how to allocate your funds across that trio of accounts:

1. **401(k)**: First up, if your employerâ€™s throwing money your way with a match, grab it like itâ€™s Black Friday! Max that out before considering anything else. Free money? Yes, please.
   
2. **IRA**: Go for a mix of Traditional and Roth IRAs. The Traditional is your tax-deduction buddy, while the Roth will let you sip piÃ±a coladas tax-free in retirement. The ideal combo depends on whether you want a tax break now or later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Think of these as your â€˜fun moneyâ€™ zone. Theyâ€™ve got flexibilityâ€”no penalties for early withdrawals. Stick your dividends and interest-bearing investments here to keep the other accounts tax-efficient. 

4. **Diversify**: Donâ€™t just throw everything at stocks; mix in some bonds and maybe a REIT or two. Different accounts serve different purposesâ€”optimize them accordingly.

5. **Reassess Annually**: Money moves and life changesâ€”review your allocations every year. Adjust based on market conditions and your ever-evolving goals. 

At the end of the day, itâ€™s all about strategy and knowing when to pivot. Happy investing!
