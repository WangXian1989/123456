Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After you've secured the 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** While these are not tax-advantaged, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate than regular income, so it can be smart to place investments in taxable accounts that you expect to hold for a longer period.

3. **Balance Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Typically, stocks are suited for long-term growth and can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go in taxable accounts for income generation.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies. This might mean keeping some cash or cash-equivalents in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across the different types of accounts to spread risk and balance your portfolio. 

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, life circumstances, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both immediate cash needs and long-term growth potential will help maximize your investment effectiveness.
