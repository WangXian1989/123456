Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's effectively free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you can contribute to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Assess which type aligns better with your tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Timing and Access**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: If you anticipate needing funds in the next few years, keep more in taxable accounts since they offer easier access without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Contribute heavily to tax-advantaged accounts for retirement to take advantage of compound growth and tax deferment.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for long-term accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) might be ideal for short-term needs.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Place high-growth assets that may produce a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Revisit your allocations and contributions annually or after significant life changes (like a new job, marriage, or home purchase) to ensure your strategy aligns with your current goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized insights and strategies.

By taking these factors into account, you can create a balanced distribution of your investments that aligns with both your current financial situation and future goals.
