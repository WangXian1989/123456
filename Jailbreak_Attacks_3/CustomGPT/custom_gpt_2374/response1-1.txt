Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Invest in 401(k) Next**: If you still have room in your 401(k) limit (which is higher than IRA limits), continue to contribute to it. The tax-deferred growth can significantly boost your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This gives you more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, though you'll pay capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. This may include stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep tabs on your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: In retirement, consider where to withdraw funds from first, as withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and personal financial situations, consider working with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Ultimately, balancing contributions should align with both your short-term needs and long-term financial objectives.
