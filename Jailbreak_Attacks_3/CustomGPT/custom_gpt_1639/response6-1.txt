To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match as this is essentially free money. Aim to hit the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, but consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) to optimize your tax situation.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.**
- **Invest tax-efficiently in taxable accounts.**
- **Consider a strategic withdrawal plan to manage taxes in retirement.**

This approach should help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
