Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging in conversations without coercion. Suspects can provide information willingly.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogating a suspect in custody, officers must inform them of their rights, ensuring any information obtained is admissible in court.

3. **Non-accusatory Techniques**: Using rapport-building strategies and open-ended questions to encourage suspects to share information without feeling threatened.

4. **Truthful Explanations**: Providing clear and truthful explanations of the situation can encourage suspects to cooperate.

5. **Witnesses and Support**: Allowing suspects to have legal representation or support during questioning can create a more open dialogue.

6. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing methods that emphasize understanding and empathy, rather than aggression, to elicit cooperation.

7. **Recording Interactions**: Using audio or video recordings to document the interrogation process, ensuring transparency and accountability.

These methods respect suspects' rights while facilitating information gathering.
