(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. This can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals that are shorter-term or for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates, like stocks.
4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all account types.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is advisable.

1. **Start with the 401(k)**: Max out that employer match first â€“ itâ€™s like a free pizza, why wouldn't you grab it?
2. **Dive into IRAs**: Depending on your tax situation, go for a Roth IRA if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later. Otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA to lower your taxable income now.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playground for investments that you might want to touch sooner or for strategies that take advantage of capital gains. Plus, theyâ€™re useful if your 401(k) and IRA are maxed out.

Donâ€™t forget to keep it diverse across all accounts based on your risk vibe! And if youâ€™re feeling stuck, grabbing a financial advisor might save you some headaches later on.
