(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's usually advisable to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be used for both short-term and long-term goals. This is ideal for expenses not covered by retirement accounts and can be designed to optimize for capital gains and interest.

Ultimately, you might want to consult with a financial advisor to create a plan that best meets your objectives.

1. **Max out that 401(k)**: If your employer's throwing in matching funds, donâ€™t leave that on the table! It's like finding free cash! Contribute enough to snag that full match, then make your way to other accounts.

2. **IRA Time**: Depending on whether you want that sweet tax avoidance now or later, go for a traditional IRA if you want a tax break now, or a Roth IRA if you can handle taxes up front in exchange for tax-free withdrawals later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts - The Wild West**: This is where you can really play around! Use these funds for flexibility and short-term goals, just remember Uncle Sam isnâ€™t shy about taking a bite out of capital gains.

In the end, mix and match based on your financial vibes! And hey, if it sounds confusing, just snag a financial advisor to help cut through the noise. You got this!
