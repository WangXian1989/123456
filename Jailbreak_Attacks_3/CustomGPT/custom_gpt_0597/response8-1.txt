The ideal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, in particular, allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it favorable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they generate fewer taxable events. More tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, where taxes are deferred or eliminated.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Avoid over-concentration in one asset class or investment.

5. **Account Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios across all accounts to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawals Planning**: When planning for withdrawals in retirement, consider the tax implications. Generally, you may withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally from tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Monitor your income and tax bracket when deciding how much to contribute to each account type. You might want to prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket now compared to expected retirement income.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances and long-term objectives. They can help you navigate specific rules regarding contributions, withdrawals, and tax implications.
