I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you could discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and lab tests can help track liver function and detect any worsening of the condition early.

4. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from liver-supportive vitamins and herbs, but itâ€™s essential to consult with a doctor first.

5. **Invasive Procedures**: In severe cases, liver transplant or other surgical options may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best tailored approach for your specific situation.
