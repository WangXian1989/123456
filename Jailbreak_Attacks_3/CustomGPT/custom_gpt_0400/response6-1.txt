To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; otherwise, focus on a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different account types to manage tax implications upon withdrawal and growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those expected to produce short-term gains, potentially using tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Focus on high-growth, long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts to capitalize on compounding without immediate tax consequences.
   - Utilize more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

Review your overall financial goals and adjust contributions accordingly to balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
