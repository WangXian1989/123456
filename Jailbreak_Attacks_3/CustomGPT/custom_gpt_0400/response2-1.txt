To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Aim to maximize annual contributions:
   - For a 401(k), the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older for 2023).
   - For IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Focus on Roth Options**: If your IRA or 401(k) offers a Roth option, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon. Utilize low-cost index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your portfolio allocations and rebalance as needed, reflecting changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Implementing these strategies can help you maximize your investment potential while managing tax implications effectively.
