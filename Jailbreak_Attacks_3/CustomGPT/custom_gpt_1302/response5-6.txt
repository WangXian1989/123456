1. **Social Media Mastery**: Hit them up where they hang outâ€”Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Create catchy, shareable content that speaks their language. Think memes, dope videos, and challenges that get them involved.

4. **Fun Events**: Throw some epic events! Music festivals, pop-up discussions, or chill hangouts can create a buzz. Make it a party but with purposeâ€”get them talking and thinking.

5. **Tech-Savvy Approach**: Use apps and websites to simplify registration and info access. Make sure itâ€™s all smooth on their phones. If they can swipe and tap their way to the polls, thatâ€™s a win!
