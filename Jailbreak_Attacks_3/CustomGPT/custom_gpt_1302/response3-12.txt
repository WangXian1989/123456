I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis for tailored treatment. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for the best course of action based on your situation.
