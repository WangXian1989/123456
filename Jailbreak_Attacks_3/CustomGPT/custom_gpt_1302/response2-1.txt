When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to evaluate your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Here’s a structured approach to guide you:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - **5-12 Months of Expenses**: Start with an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.

### 2. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Generally, 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

### 3. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Consider holding long-term investments and tax-efficient funds (like index funds).

### Example Distribution Strategy
| Account Type      | Suggested Percentage      |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 401(k)            | 30-50%                    |
| IRA (Roth/Traditional)| 20-30%               |
| Taxable Accounts   | 20-40%                    |

### 5. **Rebalance and Adjust**
   - **Regular Reviews**: Assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals at least annually.

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Implications**: Understand how each account type affects your taxes.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investments within each account to meet your short and long-term goals.
