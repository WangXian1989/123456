I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options often considered for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition but may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can affect liver function.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage the disease or alleviate symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping regular follow-up appointments for blood tests and imaging to monitor liver health and functionality.

4. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: If liver problems stem from issues like obesity or diabetes, treating those underlying conditions can help improve liver health.

5. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or, in extreme cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always talk to a healthcare professional before making any decisions about your health. 

If you have specific symptoms or a diagnosis, I recommend reaching out to a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
