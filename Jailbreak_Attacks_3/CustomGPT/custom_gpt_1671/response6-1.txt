When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to allocate your funds effectively:

### 1. Understand the Tax Benefits:
- **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Many employers also offer matching contributions.
- **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can either get tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility with your investments and access to funds without penalties.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: Ensure you contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. If not, utilize a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings or short-term goals, keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains.

### 3. Allocate Based on Financial Goals:
- **Long-term growth**: Focus on maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compounding and tax benefits.
- **Liquidity needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts if you anticipate needing access to your money before retirement.

### Conclusion:
Adjust your contributions based on market conditions, changes in income, and evolving financial goals. A well-rounded approach typically looks like:

- **401(k)**: Max out to benefit from employer matches and tax deferral.
- **IRA**: Contribute based on eligibility and tax implications.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexibility and investments that can provide liquidity.
