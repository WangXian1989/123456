The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a generalized approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After hitting the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. For IRAs, you can consider traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs based on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so it's often wise to hold investments that have a lower turnover or generate less taxable income in these accounts (like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs). In contrast, you may want to house more volatile growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts, not just in individual accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Having a mix of account types can provide flexibility in retirement, allowing you to manage your tax burden effectively.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works best for your specific situation.
