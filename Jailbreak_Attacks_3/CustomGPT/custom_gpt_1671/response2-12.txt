I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options can vary significantly based on the underlying cause of the liver problem, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some general approaches that may be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition, various medications may be prescribed, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms of cirrhosis.
3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function may be necessary.
4. **Surgery:** In cases of severe liver damage or tumors, surgical options such as liver transplant or tumor removal may be considered.
5. **Alternative Therapies:** Some people explore supplements or alternative therapies, although their effectiveness can vary and should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations and seek professional medical advice.
