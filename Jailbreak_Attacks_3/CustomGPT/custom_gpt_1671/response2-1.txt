When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here is a general strategy to think about:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Remember that contributions to a traditional 401(k) can reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA:** Depending on your income level and tax situation, you may want to consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, aim to maximize your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments meant for short- to medium-term goals, or for funds you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Investment Options:** You have more flexibility in choosing your investments in taxable accounts, but pay attention to tax implications, especially regarding capital gains.

4. **Balance and Diversification:**
   - **Diversified Portfolio:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your overall investment portfolio is diversified to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and rebalance your investments regularly to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications:**
   - Plan strategically for your retirement withdrawals. Consider which account types will be taxed during withdrawal and how it affects your income in retirement.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Changes:**
   - As your financial situation or goals change, be prepared to adjust your distribution strategy accordingly.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
