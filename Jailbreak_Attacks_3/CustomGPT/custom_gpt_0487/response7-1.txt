The ideal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), it's often advisable to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free" money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation). The contribution limits for IRAs might be lower than for a 401(k), but the tax advantages can be beneficial, especially with a Roth IRA, where qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxes**: Focus on tax efficiency. Funds in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred; however, distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. With a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. In contrast, taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax but can offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRAs for growth-oriented investments, as these accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Reserve more conservative investments for taxable accounts to minimize realized capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're younger and have a long time before retirement, you might lean more heavily toward higher-risk investments in your retirement accounts. Conversely, as you near retirement, adjusting your strategy to reduce risk becomes increasingly important.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically assess your allocations. As circumstances change—like income levels or financial goals—revisit your strategy to ensure it's still appropriate for your situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and personal financial circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that aligns with your specific situation.

By considering these aspects in your distribution strategy, you can optimize your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
