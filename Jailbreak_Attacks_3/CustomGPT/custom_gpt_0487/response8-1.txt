The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies you can consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you need the tax deduction now, a traditional IRA can be beneficial.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over age 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be beneficial.

4. **Invest in a Diverse Portfolio**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and enhance returns.

5. **Plan for Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your short-term liquidity needs. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility since you can access those funds without penalties before retirement age.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation and help you develop a comprehensive strategy.

Always consider your unique circumstances and consult with a financial professional for tailored advice.
