Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a 401(k), especially one with an employer match, consider maxing this out if it aligns with your budget and goals.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for greater flexibility. This allows you to access funds without penalties, which is helpful for non-retirement goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across sectors and asset classes in all accounts. This minimizes risk.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Keep in mind your long-term financial goals, including retirement age and anticipated expenses, to guide your allocation strategy.

6. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account. For instance, investments that generate a lot of taxable income may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Adjust as Necessary**: Review your allocations regularly and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
