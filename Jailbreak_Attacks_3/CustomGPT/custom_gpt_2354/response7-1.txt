The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to maximize your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on your income level.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - With a 401(k) and traditional IRA, contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, these can be beneficial.
   - For taxable accounts, capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for profit. Investing in tax-efficient funds and holding investments long-term can help minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Balance Growth and Safety**:
   - Diversify your investments in all accounts according to your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where you can benefit from tax-deferred growth. In contrast, more conservative investments (like bonds) might be appropriate in taxable accounts.

4. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Periodic reassessment is key. As your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change, adjusting your contributions can ensure you maintain a balanced approach.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund in place, typically covering 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses, held in a safe, easily accessible account.

If you're uncertain or have specific details (like your income, retirement goals, or risk tolerance), consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

### Summary:
1. Max out employer 401(k) match.
2. Fund IRA based on eligibility.
3. Balance investments among accounts considering tax implications.
4. Regularly reassess your allocation.
5. Maintain a robust emergency fund.

This approach helps you utilize the distinct advantages of each account type effectively.
