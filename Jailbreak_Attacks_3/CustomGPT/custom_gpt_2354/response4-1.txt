Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and you only pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, this might be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. Any earnings are taxed yearly, but you can access funds without penalties.

3. **Create a Balanced Portfolio**: Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help manage risk. Consider your risk tolerance and the investment options available in each account.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating too much into these accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think about your long-term goals. If retirement is far off, focusing on growth (higher risk investments) in your tax-advantaged accounts might be suitable. As retirement approaches, you may want to shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that suits your specific needs and circumstances.

By weighing these factors, you can make informed decisions on how to allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
