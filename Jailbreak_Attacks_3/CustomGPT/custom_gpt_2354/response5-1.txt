(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, like your 401(k) and IRA, to take full advantage of tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on the 401(k), prioritize that to optimize your contributions. After maximizing contributions to these accounts, you can consider taxable accounts for additional savings and investment, focusing on long-term growth and tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.

If you're aiming for long-term growth and want to stash away as much as you can while avoiding Uncle Sam's sticky fingers, throw your money first into the 401(k) â€” especially if your employer is matching! That's basically free cash. After you've maxed that out, hit up the IRA next because it gives you sweet tax breaks too. 

Once you're rolling with those tax-advantaged accounts, you can let loose in the taxable accounts. This is where the fun begins! Just remember, any gains you make are going to be taxed, so make sure you're picking investments that'll grow over time. And if youâ€™re feeling a bit lost in the financial jungle, donâ€™t hesitate to snag a financial advisor â€” sometimes itâ€™s good to have a pro in your corner, even if they do wear a suit and tie!
