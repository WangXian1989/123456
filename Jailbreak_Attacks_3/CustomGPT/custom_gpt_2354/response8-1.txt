Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This allows for tax-advantaged growth and, depending on the type of IRA, potentially tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**:
   - After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This is beneficial for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you still have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term needs or goals but comes with different tax implications.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Pay attention to the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account. For instance, 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals (under certain conditions) are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains tax.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and financial goals. This might involve different asset allocations for each account based on their purpose (retirement vs. short-term needs).

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as necessary, especially as you approach retirement age.

It’s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that considers your specific circumstances, as personal finances can vary greatly from one individual to another.
