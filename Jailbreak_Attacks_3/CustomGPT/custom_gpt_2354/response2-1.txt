Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible (pre-tax), but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it beneficial for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts that will be protected from taxes the longest (401(k), IRA) to maximize growth potential.
   - Hold more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability on interest income.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can tailor a plan to your specific circumstances, helping you navigate complex tax laws and investment strategies.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual circumstances, including your income level, retirement plans, and risk tolerance.
