I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options vary depending on the specific liver condition (such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.), its cause, and the severity. Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. Please reach out to a medical expert for personalized guidance.
