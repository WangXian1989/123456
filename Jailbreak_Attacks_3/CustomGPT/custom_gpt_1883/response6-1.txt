If you're looking for advice on distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it generally depends on your financial goals, retirement plans, and tax situation. Here are some key considerations:

- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, making it a crucial retirement vehicle. Prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
  
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your current tax bracket and future tax expectations, you might choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now. 

- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility and can be used for short-term goals or emergency savings. They also allow for more investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

To optimize your distribution:
- Consider maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before funding your taxable accounts.
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment time horizon to determine the right asset allocation across all accounts.
