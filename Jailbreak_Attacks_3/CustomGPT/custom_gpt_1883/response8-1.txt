Today is October 4, 2023. As for your question regarding distributing money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on eligibility). IRAs can offer tax advantages and potentially better investment choices compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility, as you can withdraw money without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from your accounts, especially if you're nearing retirement.

6. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity.
