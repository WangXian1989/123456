To address your question regarding distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if your finances allow, as these funds grow tax-deferred until retirement.

2. **IRA:** Depending on your income level, decide between a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction now, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim to contribute up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may not be suitable for retirement accounts, like stocks that you might sell in the short term or where you might want to access the funds sooner without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains tax implications.

**Diversification:** Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to minimize risk.

It's beneficial to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changes in your financial situation.
