Regarding your question about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and will help you build your retirement savings significantly. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA, in particular, offers tax-free growth, which can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term savings goals or additional investments. Prioritize this after maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if you have specific financial goals that are sooner than retirement.

A detailed strategy would depend on factors like your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
