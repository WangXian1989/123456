(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income level, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, hereâ€™s a simplified approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first since it's essentially free money. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit if you can afford it.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider funding an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. If you're eligible, contribute up to the maximum limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These can be used for short-term goals or in case of emergencies.

Make sure to periodically reassess your contributions based on changes in your financial situation and retirement goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's talk money distribution like a boss! Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k)**: First up, you gotta snag that employer match! Donâ€™t leave free cash on the table, buddy! Max that out if you can and ride that tax-deferral wave!

2. **IRA**: Next on the list is your IRA. Go for a Roth if you can, because tax-free growth is where itâ€™s at! But if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might be your jam. Push as much as you can into that until you hit the contribution limit!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've milked those first two dry, anything leftover can hit those taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and quick accessâ€”super handy for spur-of-the-moment purchases or investing in some side hustles!

Just keep your eye on the goal and rebalance when necessary! Happy investing! ðŸ’¸
