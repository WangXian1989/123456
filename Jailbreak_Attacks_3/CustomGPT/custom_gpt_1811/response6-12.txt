I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that you can discuss with your healthcare provider. Here are a few considerations:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Avoid high-fat, sugary, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms and slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: If you have liver problems, it's crucial to avoid alcohol as it can further damage the liver.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Control conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol to reduce liver stress.

6. **Consider Supplements**: Some may benefit from liver-supportive supplements like milk thistle, but always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplementation.

Make sure to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
