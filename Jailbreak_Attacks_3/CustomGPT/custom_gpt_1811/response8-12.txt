I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important for you to consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common treatment approaches may include medications, lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. In some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or procedures may be necessary. Always seek personalized advice from a medical professional who can evaluate your unique situation.
