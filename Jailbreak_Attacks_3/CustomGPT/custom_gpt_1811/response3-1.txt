The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a step-by-step approach to consider when determining the right allocation:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A tax-advantaged retirement account usually offered by employers. Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Check if your employer offers a match; if so, aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k), but typically allows for more investment options. There are traditional and Roth IRAs, with different tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts allow you to invest with fewer restrictions but do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. You will have to pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Boost IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), especially if you can take advantage of tax benefits available with IRAs.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After contributing enough to get the employer match and funding your IRA, consider putting excess funds into your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility and growth potential.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Assess your current tax bracket and expected tax bracket in retirement. Roth accounts are advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that you are diversifying not just across account types but also within your investments. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to lower risk.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation as you approach retirement or as your financial situation changes. Make adjustments to ensure that your investments align with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about your allocation or want personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your unique financial situation.

By evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
