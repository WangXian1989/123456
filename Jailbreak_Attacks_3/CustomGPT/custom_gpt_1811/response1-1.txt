Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) plan offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible (check contribution limits and income limits), consider maxing out your IRA after the 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs can offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your IRA contributions, redirect additional savings to your 401(k). This is particularly beneficial if you have a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can allocate any extra savings to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Investment Preferences:** Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals when choosing specific assets for each account type. Generally, place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable events.

6. **Regularly Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It's beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, especially regarding tax implications and personal goals.

Make sure you track your contributions and periodically review your investment performance. If you have any specific questions or details about your financial situation, feel free to ask!
