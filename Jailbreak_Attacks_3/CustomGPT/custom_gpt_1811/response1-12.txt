I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend that you consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding your liver problem. They can provide the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures. Itâ€™s crucial to get an accurate diagnosis and follow your doctor's recommendations.
