The ideal allocation of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made before taxes, lowering your taxable income. If you have a Roth 401(k) option, consider your future tax situation.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: An IRA can provide additional tax benefits. If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - Higher earners may benefit more from traditional accounts to lower their taxable income now, while those in lower brackets may find Roth accounts more advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide greater liquidity and may offer tax advantages on long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

It's essential to tailor these strategies to fit your unique financial circumstances and goals.
