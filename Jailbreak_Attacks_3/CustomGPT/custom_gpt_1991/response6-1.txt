When considering how to best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to understand the unique characteristics of each account type and your individual financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to increase contributions up to the annual limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax deductions.

### 2. Allocate for Flexibility and Taxes
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've optimized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains taxes, which are usually lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Liquidity:** Maintain some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 3. Diversify Investments 
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. This could mean having a varied portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. Consider Your Retirement Timeline
   - **Age Factor:** The younger you are, the more you might want to focus on growth-oriented investments, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how you will withdraw funds during retirement, which could affect how much you allocate to each type of account based on tax implications.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial to create a tailored strategy that meets your needs.
