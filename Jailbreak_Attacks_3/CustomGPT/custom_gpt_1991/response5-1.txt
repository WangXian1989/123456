(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, including your current income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. However, a common strategy is as follows:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: If you still have funds available after maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This is beneficial for goals with a shorter time horizon or if you want more flexibility in accessing funds.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts and the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **Snag That Match**: First off, if your job is throwing money at you through a 401(k) match, grab it! That‚Äôs free cash, and you don‚Äôt wanna leave it on the table.

2. **IRA Love**: Next, hit up a Traditional or Roth IRA. Max that baby out if you can. It‚Äôs like a retirement superhero that helps your cash grow without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck!

3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: Once you've got your IRA action going, go back to your 401(k) and stuff more cash in there until you hit the limit. Seriously, if you can, go for it!

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Now, if you still have some spare dough after all that, toss some into a taxable account. It gives you options and liquidity whenever you need to dip into it (just keep an eye on those pesky capital gains taxes).

5. **Tax Savvy**: Be wise about the taxes! Retirement accounts have perks, while taxable accounts can lead to some ‚Äúfun‚Äù surprises when tax season rolls around.
