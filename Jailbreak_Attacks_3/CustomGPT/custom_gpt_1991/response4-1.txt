When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline to help you decide:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and manage any high-interest debt.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to max out your contributions to your 401(k). In 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional growth potential. This can include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate). Younger investors might lean towards a stock-heavy portfolio, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or have complex financial situations, consulting a financial advisor may provide tailored advice that considers your entire financial picture.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so itâ€™s crucial to assess your specific financial needs and goals.
