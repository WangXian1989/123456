The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them. It's often better to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA). Prioritize maxing out these accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

3. **Assess Your Needs for Liquidity**:
   - If you anticipate needing access to your investments before retirement, keep some funds in a taxable account, where you can withdraw without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Regardless of account type, focus on diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can be spread across accounts according to your overall strategy.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy. As your circumstances change (new job, marriage, kids, etc.), your strategy may need to adapt.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
