Hit them up on social mediaâ€”think TikTok dances, Instagram stories, and memes that actually make sense to them. Forget the boring TV ads; they tune out that crap! Focus on issues that really matter to themâ€”like student debt, climate change, and equalityâ€”and make the message fun and engaging. Get influencers involved who can vibe with the youth; itâ€™s like digital street cred. And don't forget to make registration easy-peasyâ€”nothing stops a young voter like a confusing signup process!
