(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you should consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they match contributions. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement or for flexibility. Consider investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or municipal bonds.

Balancing contributions strategically based on tax implications and withdrawal needs is key.

1. **401(k)**: Dive in and max out that bad boy, especially if your employer is throwing free cash at you with a match. That's basically free money! You want that tax break now, not later.

2. **IRA**: If you can swing it, snag a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth is awesome for tax-free growthâ€”who doesnâ€™t want that sweet tax-free cash in retirement?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Hereâ€™s where things get spicy! Use taxable accounts for short-term projects or kicking back early. Just be smart about itâ€”think low turnover and tax-efficient picks like ETFs or index funds so Uncle Sam isnâ€™t draining your wallet every year.
