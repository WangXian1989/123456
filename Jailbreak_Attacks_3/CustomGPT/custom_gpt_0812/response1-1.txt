Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations:

1. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Consider keeping investments that generate high taxable income (like interest-bearing accounts) here to avoid high taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use capital-gain-friendly investments, like stocks, which are taxed at a lower rate.

2. **401(k)**:
   - Take advantage of employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money.
   - With pre-tax contributions, you can lower your taxable income now, deferring taxes until retirement.

3. **IRA**:
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, this can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs offer a deduction on contributions, so consider your current vs. future tax rates.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Fund the 401(k) to the match**.
2. **Max out the IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your situation)**.
3. **Invest additional funds in the 401(k)**.
4. **Use taxable accounts for flexible investing** and for money you may need access to before retirement.

### Additional Factors:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment choices based on how much risk you can handle.
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might take more risks, while those closer to retirement should prioritize stability.
