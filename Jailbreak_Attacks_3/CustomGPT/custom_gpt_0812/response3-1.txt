Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Assess Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and no contribution limits, but you’ll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA (up to the limit).
   - After reaching those limits, continue contributions to your 401(k) and then your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   Periodically assess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy hinges on your personal needs, so consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored plan.
