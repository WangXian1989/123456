   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminating alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For hepatitis-related issues.
   - **Steroids**: To reduce inflammation for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: For certain bile duct disorders.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: To manage complications like varices.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases or liver failure.
