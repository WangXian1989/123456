To optimize your investment strategy across different accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages.
   - **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Assessment**: Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon to decide your mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.
   - **Account Type Strategy**:
     - **401(k)**: Typically best for high-growth assets (stocks) due to tax deferral.
     - **IRA**: A blend of stocks and bonds works well here, depending on your investment strategy.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider low-turnover investments like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your investments as necessary to maintain your desired allocation and respond to market changes.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts based on tax implications and investment goals will help maximize your long-term growth potential.
