Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Taxable Accounts
   - Invest after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep money in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts, which can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 4. Diversify Investments
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return across all accounts.

### 5. Regularly Reassess
   - Annually review your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your investment strategy and prepare effectively for retirement.
