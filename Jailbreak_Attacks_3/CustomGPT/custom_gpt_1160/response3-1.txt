Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: The limit for employee contributions may change annually; prioritize maxing contributions if you can.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost funds, such as index funds or target-date funds, to balance growth and risk.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible and taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Similar to a 401(k), focus on low-cost, diverse investments, potentially including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Tax-Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds, and consider municipal bonds for potential tax benefits.
   - **Long-term Investments**: Focus on long-term gains and dividends to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing.
- **Assess Risk Tolerance**: Balance holdings based on your risk tolerance; typically, younger investors might lean towards equities.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient distribution of your savings among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
