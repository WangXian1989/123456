Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general framework to help guide your decisions:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Strategy:** Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is effectively "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you're eligible, aim for the maximum contribution.
   - **Traditional IRA:** If your income is higher, a traditional IRA may be better for tax deductions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Growth Investments:** Use taxable accounts for investments that have favorable tax treatments, like index funds or long-term capital gains.
   - **Flexibility Needs:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Age and Time Horizon**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus more on growth (higher risk, higher reward) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement:** Shift towards safer investments and consider asset allocation strategies to protect your investments.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold bonds or high-turnover funds here to minimize taxes on dividends and short-term capital gains.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Allocate higher-growth investments in these accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocation based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start with employer-sponsored accounts, then leverage IRAs for tax benefits, and finally use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
