Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k) (with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up).

### 3. **Balance for Liquidity and Accessibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility and liquidity for shorter-term goals. It's wise to maintain some cash for emergencies.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Consider investing in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities geared for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and thus generate fewer capital gains.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as income during retirement. In contrast, Roth accounts grow tax-free, and taxable account gains are subject to capital gains tax. Strategically withdrawing from these accounts based on tax impact is crucial.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your investments to stay aligned with your financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, consider speaking with a tax or financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these strategies, you can build a balanced and effective investment portfolio that suits your financial goals.
