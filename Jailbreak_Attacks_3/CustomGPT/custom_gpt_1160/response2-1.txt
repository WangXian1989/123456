Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy. Contributions to a traditional IRA can be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferral, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals (if rules are followed).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in them for flexibility and easier access, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments appropriately across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) to maximize tax benefits.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Timeframe**
   - If you need access to money in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on retirement accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on market performance or changes in your financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds or for short-term goals.

### Consult a Professional
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
