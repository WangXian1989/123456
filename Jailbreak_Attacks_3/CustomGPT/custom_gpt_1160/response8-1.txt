Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for optimizing growth and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you are eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable investment accounts for liquidity and flexibility. You can access funds without penalties.

5. **Tax-efficient Investments:** In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

6. **Consider Asset Location:** Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (where they can grow tax-free) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

7. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
