When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Prioritize maximum contributions to these accounts, especially if your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need in the short term or to hold investments that generate lower capital gains due to long-term holding.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a selection of mutual funds or ETFs. Focus on low-cost options with diversified holdings.
   - **IRA**: Typically allows a broader range of investment options. Consider individual stocks, bonds, or ETFs as appropriate for your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may produce capital gains (e.g., stocks) to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how and when you can withdraw funds, considering penalties and tax implications for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment time frame. Generally, higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a good mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Annual Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these offer significant tax benefits. After those limits are met, consider investing in taxable accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your personal financial situation.
