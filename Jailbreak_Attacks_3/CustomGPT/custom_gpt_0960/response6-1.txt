When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to factor in a few key elements: your current financial situation, tax implications, and long-term goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversify Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. They provide flexibility for withdrawals, though you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place highly taxed investments (like bonds or actively managed mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and put tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - **Age and Retirement Goals**: If you're nearing retirement, lean towards safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA to minimize risk. If you have a longer time horizon, you might allocate more to growth-oriented investments.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Monitor your financial situation and investment performance annually to adjust allocations as needed based on market conditions and life changes.

By using these principles, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
