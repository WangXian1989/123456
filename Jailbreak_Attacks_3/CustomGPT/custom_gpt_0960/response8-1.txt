Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   - After maximizing your employer match, aim to fill your IRA contribution limits next.

3. **Continue Contributing to Your 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your specific goals and needs. This ensures you're making informed decisions based on your overall financial picture.
