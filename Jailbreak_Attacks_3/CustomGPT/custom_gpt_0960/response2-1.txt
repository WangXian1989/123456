Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement accounts with tax-deferred growth. Often includes employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Also tax-advantaged, but you have many investment options. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments. You pay capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for investments that generate low or no taxable income, like index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Focus on investments that may produce higher taxes if held in a taxable account, like high-dividend stocks or bonds.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments like stocks can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency, while conservative investments may go into taxable accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically three to six months of living expenses.

### 6. **Retirement Goals:**
   - Plan your contributions based on your retirement age and income needs. Use financial planning tools to project your retirement income from each account type.

### 7. **Revisit Annually:**
   - Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually to align with changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### General Strategy Example:
1. **Max out the 401(k) up to the employer match.**
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth.**
3. **Continue contributing to the 401(k) until max contribution limits if funds allow.**
4. **Invest remaining funds in a low-cost taxable brokerage account for flexibility.**

### Conclusion:
Every individual's situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
