Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rate.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit. This benefits from tax-deferred growth and potential employer contributions.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. This can also be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA distributions may be taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
