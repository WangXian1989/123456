Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Increase Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: Decide based on your tax situation. A Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional gives you a tax deduction now.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, contribute to both if you can manage it.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest Surplus Funds**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance.

### Considerations:
- **Time Horizon**: If you have a long time until retirement, you can afford to take more risks in your investments.
- **Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower tax rates.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes.
