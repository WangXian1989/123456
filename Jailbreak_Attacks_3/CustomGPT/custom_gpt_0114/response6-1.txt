To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds that you may need in the short term. Opt for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s wise to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate taxes.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio allocations to align with your goals and market conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities across your accounts.
