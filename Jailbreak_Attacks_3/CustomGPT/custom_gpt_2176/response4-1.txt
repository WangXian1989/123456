To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings (like interest and dividends) are taxed in the year they are realized. Long-term capital gains may have lower tax rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, as of 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (with potential catch-up contributions if you're over age 50).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and how soon you plan to access these funds. Longer time horizons may allow for more aggressive investments.

4. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first, as it’s essentially "free money".

5. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk. This may mean investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. This may involve strategically withdrawing from accounts with different tax implications to manage your tax burden in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you’re uncertain, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy specifically to your financial situation.

Ultimately, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer; the best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations.
