(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider contributing the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA first, since these accounts offer tax advantages that can greatly benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Distributing more funds to taxable accounts may be beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket or need liquidity for short-term goals. Pay attention to the tax implications of capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversification across accounts can help manage risk.

5. **Evaluate Fees**: Take note of any fees associated with your accounts, as high fees can erode returns. Look for low-cost options where possible.

Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
