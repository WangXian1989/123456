Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to guide you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Both allow tax-deferred growth, making them suitable for investments that generate high ordinary income (e.g., bonds).
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for investments that may appreciate significantly and for withdrawal flexibility in retirement without tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Consider holding investments that you plan to keep for over a year in these accounts to benefit from favorable tax treatment.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments and keep more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts if they provide tax advantages.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changing financial situations, or tax law changes. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By following this approach, you can create a balanced distribution that meets your financial goals while maximizing tax efficiency.
