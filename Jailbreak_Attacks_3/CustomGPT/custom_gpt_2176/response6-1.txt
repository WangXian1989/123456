Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide the best way to allocate your funds:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling investments. Use them for investments that generate low turnover or qualified dividends to minimize tax liabilities.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) and income-generating investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability efficiently.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might favor aggressive growth in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability and income.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - As your investments grow and market conditions change, regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across these accounts to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs.
