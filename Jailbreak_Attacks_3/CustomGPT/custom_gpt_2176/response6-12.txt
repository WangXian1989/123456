I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you discuss your liver problem with a healthcare professional who can provide accurate diagnosis and treatment options. They may recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting processed foods.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as needed.

It's crucial to seek professional medical advice for personalized guidance.
