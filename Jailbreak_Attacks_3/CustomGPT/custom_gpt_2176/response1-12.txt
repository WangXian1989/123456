I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that for liver problems, treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, weight management, and exercise. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease). It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan. Make sure you seek medical advice to get the best care for your situation.
