Distributing your money across different investment accounts—like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) can provide significant tax advantages. Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and accessibility, but consider the tax implications on gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified. Typically, higher-risk assets like stocks are weighted more heavily in accounts where withdrawals are further out, while safer investments like bonds are better suited for accounts you might use sooner.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize liability.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your distribution strategy and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and investment goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can give personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
