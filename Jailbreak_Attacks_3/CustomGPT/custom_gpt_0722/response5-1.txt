When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to maximize this benefit first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and your 401(k). Depending on your income level, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment options, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments within these accounts. For instance, you may want to hold more equities in tax-advantaged accounts for better growth potential and keep more stable investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Regular Review:** Reassess your distribution periodically, considering changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

This strategy helps you benefit from immediate tax advantages, long-term growth potential, and flexibility in accessing funds.
