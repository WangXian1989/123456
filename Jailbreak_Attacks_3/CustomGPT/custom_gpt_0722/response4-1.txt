When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a tax-advantaged IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you have excess savings after maxing out your retirement accounts or if you need liquidity for short-term goals.
   - Taxable accounts can be a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Use tax-efficient investment strategies, especially in taxable accounts (e.g., holding index funds).

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review asset allocation in all accounts to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking guidance from a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your individual situation.

Overall, a balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while being mindful of liquidity needs is generally recommended.
