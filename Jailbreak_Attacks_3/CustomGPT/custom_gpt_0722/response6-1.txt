To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, use a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax deductions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth) on retirement growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you'll need access to before retirement. Consider holding investments with lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Allocate assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, continuously rebalancing as needed.

By strategically utilizing these accounts, you can optimize your tax benefits and investment growth.
