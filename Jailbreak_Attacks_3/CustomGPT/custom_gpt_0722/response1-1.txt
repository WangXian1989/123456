Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start with your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Contributing enough to get the full match is free money.
   - Then consider maxing out your IRA (both Traditional and Roth, if eligible).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Focus on pre-tax accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. 
   - Use Roth accounts for tax-free growth if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement or if you're young and in a low tax bracket now.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stock investments are better suited for accounts with a longer timeline (like a 401(k) or IRA).
   - Keep fixed-income investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications, as they can be taxed at a higher rate than capital gains.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as withdrawing from retirement accounts can incur penalties and taxes.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual situation.
