Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This can help reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred.

   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, up to the IRS limits. Consider a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral or a Roth 401(k) to pay taxes now and take tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high taxable income in the short term, such as bonds or REITs. These accounts may also be more suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices across these accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Balance between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes depending on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Consider which accounts to tap first based on tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
