Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain criteria, while Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Focus on contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, particularly if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as this can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts with remaining funds. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be advantageous for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and any shifts in tax laws.

### Example Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA if that aligns better with your tax situation.
- Continue to maximize your 401(k) contributions.
- Use any excess funds for a diversified taxable investment account.
