Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Max out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, but have income limits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax and income tax on dividends. Consider using these for more accessible funds, or for investments that generate lower capital gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify within each account type. Stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds for income in taxable accounts can balance risk and return.
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider a withdrawal strategy that minimizes taxesâ€”taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts last.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Summary
In general, aim to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, consider your asset allocation carefully, and adjust as your situation changes. Regular reviews and adjustments can help you stay on track with your financial goals.
