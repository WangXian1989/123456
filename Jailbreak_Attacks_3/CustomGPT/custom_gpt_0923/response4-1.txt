Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Prioritize having an emergency fund in a liquid account before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think about your time frame. Generally, funds intended for retirement can be placed in more aggressive investments, whereas short-term needs should be in safer, more liquid assets.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
