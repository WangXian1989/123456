Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get any employer match**; this is essentially "free money." Aim for at least 15% of your salary if you can.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - **Consider opening a Roth or Traditional IRA** based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out the employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the IRS contribution limits.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals, though you’ll face capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify across accounts**: invest for growth (stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, and consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocated assets periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing money, especially from taxable accounts, as capital gains can affect your tax bracket.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - This recommendation can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

### Summary
Start by maximizing your 401(k) employer match, contribute to an IRA, and then fund your taxable accounts with remaining funds. Adjust according to tax efficiency and your long-term financial goals.
