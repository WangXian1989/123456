Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out this account next, as contributions are pre-tax (reducing your taxable income) and investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages. Choose Traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; choose Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These provide flexibility and can be useful for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account. Typically, higher-risk assets (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term growth. Lower-risk assets (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts, especially if holding them for income, as they can produce taxable interest.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: The time until you need to access the funds can influence your strategy. For long-term goals, focus on growth; for short-term goals, consider more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your distribution and investment performance to ensure alignment with your goals and adjust as necessary.

Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
