Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits; for 2024, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties, making them great for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions to your 401(k)** to capture the employer match.
- **Max out an IRA** next, depending on whether you prefer the tax benefits of a Traditional or the tax-free growth of a Roth.
- **Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts**, focusing on investments that offer favorable tax treatment.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
