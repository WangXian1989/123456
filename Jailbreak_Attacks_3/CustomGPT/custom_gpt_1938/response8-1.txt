Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Funds in your 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred. Focus on higher-growth investments here.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free (consider for long-term growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid investments; be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Use more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes (using the right accounts at the right time).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

Make sure to adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve!
