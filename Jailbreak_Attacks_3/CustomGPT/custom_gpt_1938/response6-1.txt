Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually, so consider holding investments that produce less taxable income here.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in investment choice; focus on diversified funds.
   - **IRA and Taxable Accounts**: Here, you can choose a wider range of investments, including stocks, bonds, and index funds for greater diversification.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund; typically, 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid, accessible account.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Align your investment strategy with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance:
     - **Younger Investors**: More in stocks for growth potential.
     - **Near Retirement**: Shift towards safer assets to preserve capital.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute 10-15% (max match).
- **IRA**: Max out the contribution limit.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Assess your current financial situation, projected tax bracket in retirement, and risk tolerance to create an effective distribution strategy tailored to your needs. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your approach based on personalized financial goals.
