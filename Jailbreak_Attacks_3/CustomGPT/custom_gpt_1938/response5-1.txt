To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contribution (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if you're over 50), keep contributing to your 401(k) to reach the annual limit ($22,500 or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

5. **Consider Tax Strategies**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. Favor tax-deferred accounts for higher-income years and taxable accounts for lower-income years to optimize your tax situation.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
