Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available—this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your match, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if it has lower fees or good investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings. Ideal for short-term goals or if you reach the maximum limits of your retirement accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

**Review Annually**: Reassess your distribution each year based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
