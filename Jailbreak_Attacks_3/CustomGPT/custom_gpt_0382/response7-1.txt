Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Contributing to a 401(k) up to the full limit is also essential if you're aiming for maximum retirement savings.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. These are best for money you might need in the near term or for specific medium-term goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are favorable for long-term growth, while bonds can offer stability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation might drift due to market performance. Regularly rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: If this feels overwhelming, it can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor who can tailor a distribution strategy to your specific situation.

Establishing a solid financial foundation can help you grow your wealth efficiently, so make the most of each account type based on your circumstances.

Happy investing!
