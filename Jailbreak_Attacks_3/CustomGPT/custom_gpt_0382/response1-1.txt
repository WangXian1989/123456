The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach this:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Pros**: Offers tax-deferred growth, and often includes employer matching contributions.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment choices, and early withdrawals may incur penalties.
   - **Recommendation**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Pros**: Tax advantages (traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Cons**: Contribution limits and income restrictions may apply.
   - **Recommendation**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for long-term tax benefits, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: More flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices; no contribution limits.
   - **Cons**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, and you don't get the tax advantages of retirement accounts.
   - **Recommendation**: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs, as well as for investments that may produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund separate from these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of living expenses.
- **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals based on your current and expected future income.
- **Diversification**: Diversify across different asset classes within each account type to manage risk.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
A common strategy is to prioritize contributions first to the 401(k) for any match, then to IRAs, and finally to taxable accounts to achieve a well-rounded investment portfolio. It's always a good idea to work with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. 

Happy investing!
