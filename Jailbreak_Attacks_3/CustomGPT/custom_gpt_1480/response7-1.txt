Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k); it offers tax-deferred growth. If you're in a higher tax bracket, this could be beneficial.
   - **IRA:** Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals and to maintain liquidity. They can also be good for investments that may generate taxable income or capital gains.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across asset classes, regardless of the account type (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Your age and risk tolerance should influence your asset allocation. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while older investors might prefer bonds for stability.

6. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review your portfolio and adjust based on performance, any life changes, or shifts in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances. 

Balancing these factors will help you effectively distribute your money among your retirement and taxable accounts.
