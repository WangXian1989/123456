Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax; withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, but offer more flexibility.

3. **Prioritize Roth Savings**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Balance Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts. This provides flexibility in managing taxes during retirement.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from taxable accounts are made first, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for later.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure you're aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If your financial situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always keep your long-term financial goals in mind when making decisions about investment distribution.
