Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Further Fund the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can go into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity but come with capital gains taxes when you sell investments. 

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are appropriately diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Revisit your allocation regularly to adjust for changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.
