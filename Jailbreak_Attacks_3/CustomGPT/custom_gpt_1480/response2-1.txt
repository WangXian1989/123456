Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts. Place income-generating assets (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to align with your goals and market changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can tailor strategies to your specific situation.

This approach helps maximize growth while managing taxation and risk effectively.
