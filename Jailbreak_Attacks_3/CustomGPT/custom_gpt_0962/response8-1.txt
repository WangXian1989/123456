Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and income eligibility rules.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Use these for goals that are shorter-term or more flexible.

3. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional).
   - After maximizing these, put additional savings into your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider having more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where capital gains can grow without annual taxation.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Reassess your strategy annually or after significant life changes, such as a new job, marriage, or a substantial income increase.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can tailor strategies to your individual situation.

This strategy helps balance tax efficiency and access to funds, ensuring you're prepared for both retirement and any immediate financial needs.
