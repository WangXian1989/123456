When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions to utilize employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, opt for a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts. Here, focus on:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your entire financial picture.

This balanced approach can help ensure you're making the most of your investments over the long term while managing tax implications.
