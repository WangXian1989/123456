Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Utilize Taxable Investments for Short-Term Goals:** If you need access to your funds before retirement age, consider putting money in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds:** Look for index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Higher Income Bracket:** Maximize retirement accounts to reduce taxable income.
   - **Lower Income Bracket:** You might prioritize taxable accounts if you're in lower brackets, benefiting from lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversification is Key:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust your allocation based on performance and to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
Every individualâ€™s financial situation is unique, so it might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
