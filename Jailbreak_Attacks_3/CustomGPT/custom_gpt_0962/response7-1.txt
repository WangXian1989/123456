Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Plan)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income. Consider traditional vs. Roth 401(k) options based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Types**: You have a choice between Traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Prioritize this if you have room after maxing out 401(k) contributions.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs give you upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### Taxable Accounts
3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are more liquid and can be used for various financial goals beyond retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### General Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing aggressively.
- **Risk Assessment**: Allocate based on your risk tolerance. Generally, a younger investor might have a heavier allocation towards stocks (higher risk), while older investors may favor bonds (lower risk).
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust the distribution based on market performance and life changes (e.g., job changes, retirement).

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and goals.
