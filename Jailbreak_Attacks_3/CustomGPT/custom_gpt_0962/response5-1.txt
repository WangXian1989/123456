Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) since they offer tax benefits. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Consider Tax Impact:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize the Roth accounts; otherwise, traditional accounts may be more beneficial now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments that generate little taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Investment Strategy:** Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance. Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Assess your asset allocation annually. Adjust contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan withdrawal strategies for retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).
