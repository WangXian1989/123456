When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and circumstances, but withdrawals in retirement will also be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, and dividends are taxed as ordinary income. Tax-efficient investment strategies (e.g., holding long-term investments) can help minimize taxes in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type to reduce risk.

4. **Strategic Contributions**:
   - Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first for tax benefits and long-term growth.
   - Once these accounts are maxed out or if you have additional savings, consider contributing to taxable accounts for more flexibility and accessibility.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Delaying withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts until required can help manage your tax bracket.

6. **Financial Goals**: Align your contributions to match your short-term and long-term financial goals. For instance, if you plan to retire early or need liquidity, you may want more funds in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexities involved in retirement planning, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner or tax advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

It's always a good idea to review your investment distribution regularly and adjust as needed based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
