To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are usually tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account that can be either Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular brokerage accounts with no tax advantages, meaning you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a **Roth IRA** may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - For those in lower brackets or expecting a decrease, a Traditional IRA might be preferable for the immediate tax deduction.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start with the 401(k) up to the match.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if possible.
   - After that, use any remaining funds for additional contributions to your 401(k) or for taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs.

6. **Maintain Liquidity:** Keep in mind your short-term cash needs. Taxable accounts may be more flexible for accessing funds without penalties.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** As markets shift, review and rebalance your asset allocation annually or after significant market movements.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized guidance based on your financial situation, itâ€™s wise to consult a financial advisor.

Ultimately, your specific distribution will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
