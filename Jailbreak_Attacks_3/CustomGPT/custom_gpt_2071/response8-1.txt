It's always wise to consider a tailored approach to distributing your money across different account types—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—based on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some steps to help guide you:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax purposes but with different contribution limits and rules.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free, making it ideal for future tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. It's important to understand how long you plan to hold investments in these accounts to minimize tax burdens.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize funding this first to take advantage of "free" money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - After maxing out any employer match, consider maxing out IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and financial situation).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, for example: 
     - 401(k): $22,500 (+$7,500 catch-up for those over 50)
     - IRA: $6,500 (+$1,000 catch-up for those over 50)
     - Roth IRA has income phase-out limits.
   
4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, consider diversifying between asset classes to spread risk. This could mean mixing stocks, bonds, and other investment types according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: 
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds. Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first (to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing), followed by tax-deferred accounts, and then tax-free accounts last.

6. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review your investment allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can help you create a distribution strategy tailored specifically to your individual circumstances.

By implementing these strategies thoughtfully, you can create a balanced approach that optimizes your tax situation while working towards your long-term financial goals.
