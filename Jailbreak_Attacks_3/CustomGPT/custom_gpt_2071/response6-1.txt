Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider reaching the contribution limit, focusing on maximizing tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** After handling the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or have lower turnover to minimize taxes. This is a good space for investments that you may need to access before retirement age without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Keep in mind that you can hold different assets in different accounts. For example, place high-growth stocks in your Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.

4. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

In summary, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, consider your tax situation in taxable accounts, diversify your investments, and regularly rebalance your portfolio. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances.
