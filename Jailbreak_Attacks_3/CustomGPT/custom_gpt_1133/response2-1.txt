I'm here to assist you with your inquiry about financial distribution. However, I cannot provide personal financial advice, including specifics on managing portfolios. Itâ€™s important to consider factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and retirement timeline.

For a comprehensive strategy, you might want to think about the following general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.
2. **IRA**: Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on current versus expected future tax rates.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have lower tax implications or for income generation.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice and a tailored approach may be beneficial. If you have more specific questions or need further information on this topic, feel free to ask!
