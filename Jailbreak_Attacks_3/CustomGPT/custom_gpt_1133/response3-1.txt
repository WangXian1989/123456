When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate a few key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are due on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, whereas Roth IRAs feature tax-free withdrawals if specific conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, and income from dividends and interest is subject to ordinary income tax.

2. **Growth Potential**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to enhance compound growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate regular income or require more liquidity.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you are within the contribution limits for each account type. For instance, 401(k) contributions have a higher limit compared to IRA contributions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider which accounts you will tap first based on tax implications and your overall financial needs.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investments within each account to your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts can hold more risk because they are long-term investments, whereas taxable accounts may require a more conservative approach.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seeking personalized advice from a financial professional can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

By balancing these aspects, you can develop a distribution strategy that optimally aligns your investments with your financial goals while managing tax implications effectively.
