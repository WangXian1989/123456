Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here's a general framework:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This account benefits from tax-deferred growth and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Find the right type for youâ€”traditional or Roth. A traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when choosing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need before retirement, or for goals outside of retirement. Aim for tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

The best distribution will depend on factors unique to your situation, including your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your needs.
