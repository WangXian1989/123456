Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires consideration of several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some strategies to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - Contributions to a **Traditional 401(k)** and IRA reduce your taxable income for the year, while **Roth accounts** require after-tax contributions but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts** are subject to capital gains tax on profits, so prioritize your tax-advantaged options for growth.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options**
   - Look at the investment choices available in each account:
     - **401(k):** May have fewer options, often limited to a selection of mutual funds and ETFs.
     - **IRA:** Generally offers a wider range of investment choices.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** You can invest in almost anything, including individual stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will access these funds. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity without penalties, while retirement accounts often have restrictions and may incur penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your investments and their performance across these accounts. Adjust your contributions and allocations based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Then, max out contributions to an IRA.
3. Finally, allocate any excess savings to your taxable accounts if you're aiming for more liquidity and investment flexibility.
