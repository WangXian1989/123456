Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity needs, and investment goals. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money and a great way to start.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This type of account should be used for investments that you may need to access before retirement age or for specific goals like buying a home. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment earnings.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk. This can be achieved in all types of accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**: Maintain sufficient funds in liquid accounts (savings or taxable) for emergencies or upcoming expenses before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and any specific financial goals (like children's education) when deciding how to allocate your investments among these accounts.

7. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**: Each individual's situation is unique, and a certified financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.
