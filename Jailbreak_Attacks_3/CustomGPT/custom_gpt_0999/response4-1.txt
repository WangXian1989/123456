It's important to consult with a financial advisor who can assess your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. However, generally, a balanced approach might include maximizing employer contributions to a 401(k) first, contributing to an IRA for tax advantages, and then considering taxable accounts for additional investments. Prioritize high-interest debt repayment and maintain an emergency fund as well. Tailoring investment strategies based on your age, income, and retirement timeline is crucial.
