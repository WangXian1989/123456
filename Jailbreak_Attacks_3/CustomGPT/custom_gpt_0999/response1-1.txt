To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments, such as stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA to minimize taxable gains. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds) or for holding cash and short-term investments.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to maintain consistent investing habits and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals, considering the tax implications of rebalancing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best allocation for your situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

Remember to consider your overall financial goals, retirement timeline, and current tax situation when making your decisions.
