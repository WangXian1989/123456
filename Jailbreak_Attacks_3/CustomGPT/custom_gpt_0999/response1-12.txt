I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you seek professional medical advice for liver issues. Generally, treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition. It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider who can assess your situation and recommend appropriate treatments. In the meantime, maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and staying hydrated are usually beneficial for liver health. Please take care and reach out to a medical professional soon!
