The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing to this account until you reach that limit.
   - **IRA**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions (if eligible) or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current and expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Typically, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts on gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your investment strategy and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and long-term planning, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This strategy can help you build a solid foundation for retirement while taking advantage of tax benefits.
