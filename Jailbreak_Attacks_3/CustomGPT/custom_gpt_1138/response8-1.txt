Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations to help you strategize:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching.
     - Contributions are tax-deferred; you pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are owed on withdrawals.
     - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
     - Lower contribution limits than a 401(k).
   
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No tax advantages, but you can access your money at any time without penalties.
     - Capital gains taxes apply on profits when you sell investments.
     - Flexible and useful for short to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Prioritize Account Types Based on Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Retirement Goals:**
     - If your goal is long-term retirement, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and consider contributing to IRAs (especially if you qualify for a Roth).
  
   - **Shorter-Term Goals:**
     - For nearer-term financial goals (like buying a house), a taxable account may be more appropriate since it provides more liquidity without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Try to balance your investments based on their tax treatment:
     - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) are better suited for taxable accounts.
     - Higher-taxed investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) can be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to manage risk and improve potential returns.

### 6. **Review Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you’ll withdraw funds from each account type, considering tax implications.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If your situation is complex, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual needs.

By considering these factors and aligning your contributions with your financial goals and timelines, you can effectively manage your asset distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
