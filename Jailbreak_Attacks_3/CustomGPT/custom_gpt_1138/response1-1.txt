When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider. Here’s a breakdown of an effective strategy:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Contributing to the maximum can benefit your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to remain in a similar or higher tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Consider Investment Choices**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds) or investments that you plan to hold long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: You can offset gains with losses in taxable accounts, which can reduce your overall tax burden.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: If you have limited funds, prioritize contributions to a 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider your IRA options before fully funding taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts (like bonds).
- **Diversification**: Ensure that your entire portfolio across all accounts is well-diversified to mitigate risk.

### Regular Review:
- Monitor and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes, and reassess your investment strategies annually.

Consulting with a financial adviser can help tailor this general strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
