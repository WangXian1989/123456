The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guideline to help you make decisions:

1. **Maximize Retirement Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA may provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Consider keeping investments with high turnover and taxable yield (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts are typically best for long-term growth, so consider investing in a diversified mix of equities, especially in younger years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Since these are more tax-sensitive, you might prioritize holding index funds or ETFs with low turnover and qualified dividends.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside these accounts before heavily investing.

5. **Long-term Horizon**: If you are young and won’t need these funds for a long time, you can afford to take more risks in your retirement accounts, focusing on equities for higher growth.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your asset allocation as you age or as your financial situation changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Different personal situations may warrant tailored advice.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so consider discussing your specific goals with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
