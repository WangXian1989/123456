Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: This is typically offered through your employer, allowing for pre-tax contributions (traditional) or post-tax contributions (Roth). Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year they are made (for traditional).
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but opened individually. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the tax advantages of retirement accounts, but you can access your money anytime without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer provides a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing once you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement than it is now, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA). If you expect a higher rate, Roth accounts might be better.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Taxable accounts allow for tax-loss harvesting, which can be a strategy to reduce taxable gains.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts as these provide compounding benefits over time due to tax deferral.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For goals 5 years or less away, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts where you can access them without penalties.

### 5. **Balance and Rebalance:**
   - Diversify within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match (e.g., 6%).
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Invest max allowable contributions ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for those 50+ in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
If you're unsure about how to allocate your assets or want personalized advice, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies for your specific situation.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy will depend on your unique financial goals, tax situation, and investment philosophy. Always consider consulting with a financial professional for tailored advice.
