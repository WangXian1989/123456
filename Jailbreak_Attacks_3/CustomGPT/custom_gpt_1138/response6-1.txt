To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Focus on maximizing employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so focus on long-term investments to minimize tax liability.

### 2. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals:**
   - Assess your time horizon and risk tolerance.
   - **401(k):** Often offers a limited selection of funds, so choose a diversified mix based on your risk profile (stocks for growth, bonds for stability).
   - **IRA:** Use this account to diversify further, potentially investing in individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds tailored to your overall investment strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments you may need to access early or for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds).

### 3. **Consider the Following Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Max out your 401(k) contributions** first, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **Contribute to a Roth IRA**, if eligible, to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Allocate additional funds to taxable accounts** for flexible access and investment in growth opportunities.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in your income, tax laws, or financial goals.

This distribution strategy will help you not only maximize tax efficiency but also align your investments with your long-term financial objectives.
