When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should evaluate a few key factors: your tax situation, investment goals, time horizon, and overall financial strategy. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and tips on how to allocate your funds:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **Investment Choices**: Check the investment options available in your plan, as they can vary significantly.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, allowing for tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including growth, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Considerations**: Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most flexibility, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties at any time.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider the tax implications when choosing investments.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can invest in a broader range of assets not available in tax-advantaged accounts.

### **General Strategies for Distribution:**
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts before allocating significant funds to taxable accounts.
  
2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRA contributions. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, focus on traditional retirement accounts.
  
3. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you're saving for a specific goal that requires liquidity (like buying a home), consider putting more in taxable accounts. Otherwise, keep your focus on retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments across various asset classes to minimize risk.

5. **Regularly Review Your Allocation**: Life circumstances change, so it’s important to frequently assess and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to take advantage of employer match (e.g., 15-20% of your income).
- **IRA (choose based on tax situation)**: Contribute to whichever is more beneficial based on your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate (e.g., $6,500 if under 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Redirect any additional savings and investment capital once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, your distribution should reflect your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that's suited to your needs.
