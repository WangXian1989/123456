To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, maximize your contributions (the annual limit for employee contributions in 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions and employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (with annual contribution limits of $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Allocation Strategies:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals to decide how to allocate assets among these accounts. You may want to have a more aggressive investment strategy in tax-advantaged accounts and a balanced approach in taxable accounts due to tax implications.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events. 
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income, as they are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Maintain Flexibility:**
   - Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts so you have access to funds without penalties, especially for short-term goals.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risks and enhance potential returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals due to market fluctuations.

6. **Consider Lifecycle Funds:**
   - If you're unsure about constructing your portfolio, consider lifecycle funds offered by many retirement plans. These funds automatically adjust their asset allocation as you approach retirement.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can personalize strategies based on your financial situation and retirement objectives.
