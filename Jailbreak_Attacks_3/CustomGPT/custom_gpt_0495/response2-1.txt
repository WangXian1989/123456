The most effective way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, with tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on earnings, but they offer more flexibility with withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Long-Term Growth**: If your primary focus is on long-term retirement growth, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: If you have near-term financial goals (like buying a house), a taxable account might be more appropriate due to its liquidity.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified. This means not only diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) but also ensuring that the investments in each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your investment objectives and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances can vary greatly, consider working with a financial advisor for a personalized analysis that considers your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these principles, you can develop a balanced strategy for distributing your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
