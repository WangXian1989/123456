Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Contribute to Your 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money. Prioritize maxing out contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Liquid Assets:** Maintain a portion in taxable accounts for short-term goals or liquidity needs. This provides flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes on gains, while holding lower-growth or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - **Regularly Review Allocation:** Continually reassess your investment allocation and re-balance as necessary based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.
   - **Evaluate Fees and Expenses:** Be aware of the fees associated with each account type, as high fees can erode returns over time.

By understanding these principles, you can optimize your investment strategy according to your individual financial landscape. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
