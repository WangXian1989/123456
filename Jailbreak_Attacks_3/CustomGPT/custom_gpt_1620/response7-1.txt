To optimize your investment strategy and ensure effective distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next since these accounts offer potential tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA), depending on your choice.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and may have a limited selection of investment options.
   - **IRA:** Allows for more flexibility in choosing investments; has lower contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for holding investments that generate capital gains or dividends, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement age.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Consider holding higher-growth assets or those that generate taxable income here, with the intention of deferring taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains tax rates or qualified dividends, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive growth strategies.

### 4. **Review Periodically**
   - Assess your strategy regularly and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from tax-deferred accounts vs. taxable accounts, especially as you approach retirement.

### **Practical Illustration**
- **Example Allocation:**
  - Maximize employer match in a 401(k) (e.g., 6% of salary),
  - Contribute to an IRA (up to the limit of $6,000 or $7,000 if over 50),
  - Any remaining savings can flow into a taxable account.

By systematically prioritizing these steps, you would effectively distribute your finances to leverage the benefits of each account type.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your specific financial goals, income level, tax situation, and retirement time horizon. Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
