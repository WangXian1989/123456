To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contribute to your traditional IRA if you want the tax deduction. If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial.
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and thus lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Rebalancing**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as different accounts may have different tax implications.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a taxable account to cover unexpected expenses without having to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices and contributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
