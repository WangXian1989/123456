I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease (e.g., hepatitis), medications may help manage symptoms or the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant might be an option.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
