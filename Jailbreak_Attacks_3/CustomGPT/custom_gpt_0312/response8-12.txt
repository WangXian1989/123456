I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver issues and treatments. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some treatment options typically considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or entecavir may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: Used to reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or herbal supplements, but always discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

It's crucial to discuss any potential treatments with your doctor, who can provide guidance based on your specific condition.
