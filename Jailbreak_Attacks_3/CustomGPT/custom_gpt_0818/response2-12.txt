I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems that are typically discussed with healthcare professionals:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies might be necessary to monitor liver function and progression of any disease.

4. **Vaccinations**: If you have liver disease, itâ€™s important to get vaccinated against hepatitis A and B to prevent further liver damage.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore supplements or alternative medicine, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare provider first.

It's imperative to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition and medical history.
