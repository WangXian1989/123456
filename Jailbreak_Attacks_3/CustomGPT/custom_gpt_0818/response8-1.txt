Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it’s often best to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can afford it, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts often offer tax advantages. Depending on your income, you might choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to generate a lot of taxable income, such as bonds or high-dividend stocks, as they won’t be taxed until withdrawal.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate some funds to taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. This can provide liquidity without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risks.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will affect your tax bracket in retirement. Ideally, you would want a mix of tax-deferred and tax-free income sources.

7. **Adjust as Needed**: Periodically review your allocations in response to changing financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.
