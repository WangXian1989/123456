(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: The 401(k) and IRA offer tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth. Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you might face different tax implications. Evaluate which is more beneficial based on your current tax rate and expected future tax rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, make sure to choose a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable account. Be mindful of investment selection here, as capital gains taxes may apply.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change.
