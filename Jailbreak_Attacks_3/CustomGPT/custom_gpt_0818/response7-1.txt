It's essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here’s a general approach you can follow:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Afterward, assess how much additional income you can defer into your 401(k), taking into consideration the contribution limits.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may want to allocate some of your funds to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction now, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider maxing this out as it can offer significant tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility as you can access the money without penalties before retirement age. However, be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments.

To optimize your strategy, consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts and higher-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts. Regularly review the allocation and adjust based on market conditions and your evolving financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Remember that financial planning is highly personal, so it’s crucial to do what feels right for your individual circumstances.
