When assessing the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, and you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax), the tax implications will vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, and any dividends are taxed as income.

2. **Investment Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA. For short-term needs or liquidity, consider taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out contributions for employer-matched funds in a 401(k) first.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalty, while retirement accounts have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across account types, balancing risk according to your time horizon and risk tolerance.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Consider when you plan to retire, as this affects how aggressively you can invest your money.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
