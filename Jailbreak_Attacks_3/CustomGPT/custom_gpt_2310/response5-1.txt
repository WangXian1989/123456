(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a potential approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching.
2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on which one fits your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on your financial situation and goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get into it! The key to distributing your cash wisely is getting the most bang for your buck while keeping those pesky taxes at bay. Hereâ€™s a no-nonsense game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: If your job offers a matching contribution, go for it! Free money is a no-brainer.
2. **IRAs**: After youâ€™ve snagged that match, aim for a Roth IRA if you qualify. Tax-free growth sounds awesome, right? But if you think youâ€™ll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might work better.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out those tax-advantaged accounts, throw some extra cash into taxable accounts. They give you access to your money when you need it, plus you can manage your taxes with investments that generate tax-efficient income.

Remember to adjust your strategy based on life changes. Keep it flexible!
