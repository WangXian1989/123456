The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) are good for long-term investments, while taxable accounts can hold more liquid or easily accessible assets.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Keep your investment allocations diversified across all accounts, but be mindful of tax efficiency. For instance, consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

Consider these factors to create a strategy that balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential.
