Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can (2023 limit: $22,500).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (2023 limit: $6,500). Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Contributions are often tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth). Withdrawals will be taxed at your ordinary rate, so assess your future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For investments here, focus on tax-efficient funds and consider holding investments long enough to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. These accounts can often accommodate higher-risk investments due to their long-term nature.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus more on dividend-paying stocks or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Before Investing**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might favor aggressive growth (more stocks), while those nearing retirement might shift to more conservative investments.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Keep an eye on your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion:
Each individual's situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and goals.
