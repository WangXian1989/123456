Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan; contributions may reduce taxable income. Often has employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Tax-advantaged account with potential tax deductions. Traditional IRAs defer taxes; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Standard investment accounts with no tax advantages; capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

### 3. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA next for tax deduction benefits. Assess your current and future tax brackets to determine the best strategy.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as it provides tax-free withdrawals later.

### 4. **Distribute Available Funds:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, allocate any additional funds to your taxable investment accounts. 

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Focus on growth-oriented investments since you won’t be taxed on gains until withdrawal (or tax-free in Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains and dividends.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions. Adjust your contributions as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation.

This distribution strategy helps you take advantage of tax benefits while preparing for a secure financial future.
