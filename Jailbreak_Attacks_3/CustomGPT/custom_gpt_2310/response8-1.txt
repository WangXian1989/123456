Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for savings and investments beyond these accounts. They offer flexibility for early withdrawals and no contribution limits, but they might incur capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to manage tax liabilities before tapping into retirement accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
