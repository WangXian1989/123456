I'm not a medical professional, but there are several treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes** 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications** 
   - **Antivirals**: For liver infections like hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid buildup in conditions like cirrhosis.

3. **Monitoring** 
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor the progression of liver disease.

4. **Surgery** 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Complementary Therapies** 
   - Some may benefit from herbal supplements, but always consult a healthcare provider first.

Consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
