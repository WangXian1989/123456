Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Place higher-growth investments (which may generate more short-term capital gains or dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, preventing you from withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and contributions. Adjust as needed based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and personal financial situations, working with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By strategically managing your contributions and understanding the tax implications, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
