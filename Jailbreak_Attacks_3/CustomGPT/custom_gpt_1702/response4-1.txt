I can’t provide specific financial advice or predictions. However, I can explain some key factors to consider when deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - A 401(k) often offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions or investment gains until withdrawal.
   - An IRA (Individual Retirement Account) can also provide tax advantages, especially if it’s a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions).
   - Taxable accounts do not have tax advantages for growth, and you may be liable for capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Each account type has different contribution limits. For instance, 401(k) limits may be higher than IRA limits, so maximizing contributions to the 401(k) might be beneficial if your employer offers a match.

3. **Access to Funds**:
   - Retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) generally have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts allow more flexibility to access funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices depending on the plan provider. IRAs usually offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

5. **Financial Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. Taxable accounts may be more suitable for shorter-term needs, while retirement accounts are geared towards long-term growth.

Ultimately, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
