(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s effective to prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored retirement accounts like a 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Lastly, taxable accounts can be beneficial for investment flexibility and liquidity, particularly for short-term goals or emergencies. It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your overall financial plan.
