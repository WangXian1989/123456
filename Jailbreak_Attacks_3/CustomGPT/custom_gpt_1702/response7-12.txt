I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment options tailored to your specific condition. 

Typically, treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in some cases, procedures for liver disease management. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. It's crucial to get a professional diagnosis and personalized advice.
