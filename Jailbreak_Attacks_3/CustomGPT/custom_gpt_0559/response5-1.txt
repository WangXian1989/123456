Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Aim to fully fund your IRA (both traditional and Roth options, if applicable) after maximizing your 401(k) match. The contribution limits for IRAs are generally lower than those for 401(k)s.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow the same taxation rules as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Investment Choices**
   - Your investment options may vary between accounts. 401(k) plans may have limited selections, while IRAs and taxable accounts can give you a broader range of investment choices.

### 5. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account, but be aware of your overall asset allocation across all accounts to minimize risk.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Understand the rules for withdrawals from each account, especially regarding early withdrawal penalties and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

### Suggested Order of Operations:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions.
3. **401(k)**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider after-tax investments as supplementary savings.
