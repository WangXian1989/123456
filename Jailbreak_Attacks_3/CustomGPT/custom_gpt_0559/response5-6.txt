1. **Social Media Blitz**: Forget polished campaigns; think memes, quick videos, and TikTok dances! Young voters live online, so flood their feeds with relatable content that's more fun than a cat video.

2. **Embrace Real Talks**: They're over the BS. Speak directly to issues like climate change and college debt without sugarcoating it. Authenticity wins here, so share real stories and experiences.

3. **Partner with Trendsetters**: Team up with influencers or popular TikTokers who can make you look cooler than a cat riding a unicorn. They can spread your message way better than any traditional ad cringe.

4. **Create Vibey Events**: Think festivals or pop-up events with music and a good cause. Make voting feel like the ultimate hangoutâ€”not a dull chore.

5. **Simplify the Vote**: Make voting feel as easy as ordering takeout. Create simple guides, reminder texts, or even swipe-ups to register. If they know how to navigate their social media, they can navigate the voting process too!
