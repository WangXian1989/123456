Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can also reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing any matches, allocate funds between your 401(k) and IRA based on your goals:
   - **Long-Term Savings**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For goals in the next 1-5 years, consider taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility without penalties on withdrawals.

4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**: Be aware of the different rules for withdrawal from each type of account to avoid penalties and taxes:
   - **401(k)**: Penalties for early withdrawal before age 59Â½.
   - **IRA**: Similar penalties for traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw contributions tax-free.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax implications when choosing investments:
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Keep higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and markets change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can offer personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping optimize your investment strategy.

Ensure you adjust this strategy based on your unique financial circumstances and goals.
