Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your eligibility for tax deductions, contributing to a traditional IRA may provide tax advantages. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After obtaining the employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This allows for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for long-term retirement savings.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts provide more flexibility in terms of accessing your money without penalties. However, be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains, interest, and dividends.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-balanced across different asset classes—in each account. This means spreading investments in stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** If you’re younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might lean more heavily into growth-oriented investments. As you get closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially if your financial situation changes or market conditions shift.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
