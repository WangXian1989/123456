When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax benefits on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility with investments, but capital gains taxes apply to profits when you sell investments, which can lead to tax liabilities.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, 401(k) contributions can be up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50), and IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before moving funds to IRAs or taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term investments for retirement can be more aggressive within tax-advantaged accounts, while you might want to be more conservative in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type. This can help mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - Consider your needs for liquidity. Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA funds are subject to withdrawal rules.

7. **Estate Planning:**
   - Think about the implications of inheriting funds. Different accounts have varying tax treatments for beneficiaries.

A potential strategy might be to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) to secure any matching contributions, followed by a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation, and finally placing any extra funds into a taxable account for investment flexibility.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation and goals.
