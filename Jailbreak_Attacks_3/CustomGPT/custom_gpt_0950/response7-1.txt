Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown of strategies:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose a mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon (e.g., stocks for growth if you’re younger, bonds for stability as you approach retirement).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA to lower your taxable income now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current tax rate vs. expected tax rate during retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you are aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for 50 and older for 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement, such as a home purchase or emergency funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with Employer Match:** Max out your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match first.
- **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing the match, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on a diverse portfolio.

### Conclusion:
Reassess your investments regularly based on your changing goals and financial situation. Diversifying across these accounts can help you optimize tax efficiency and prepare for retirement more effectively. If necessary, consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
