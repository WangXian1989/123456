When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some factors to consider for optimal allocation:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing at least enough to unlock the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contribution limits: As of 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50), so aim to contribute as much as you can within this limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose between Traditional and Roth: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial, as withdrawals are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA may provide better upfront tax benefits.
   - Maximize your contributions: The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: If you need access to funds within a few years, taxable accounts are more flexible than retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of taxes: Investments in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments and potentially more volatile assets, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Location**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then max out contributions if possible.
- **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k), consider fully funding an IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining investment funds can go here, especially for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

### Regularly Review:
- Continuously assess and adjust your contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and timeline. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
