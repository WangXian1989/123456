Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering various factors, including tax implications, retirement goals, and your current financial situation. Here's a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. The choice between traditional and Roth depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Within the 401(k) and IRA, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

This strategy should help you maximize your retirement savings while considering tax implications and investment growth.
