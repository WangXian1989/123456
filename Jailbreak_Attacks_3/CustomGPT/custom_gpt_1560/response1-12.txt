I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific liver condition. Some common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or other specific treatments depending on the severity and type of liver problem. It's essential to seek professional advice to ensure proper care.
