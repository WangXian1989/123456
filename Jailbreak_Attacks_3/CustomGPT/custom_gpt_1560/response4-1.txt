Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it. Conversely, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments at a profit. Consider holding long-term investments in these accounts to reduce taxes.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors might have more in stocks for growth, while older investors might shift towards bonds for stability.
   - Ensure diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

4. **Adjust for Time Horizon**:
   - If you plan to use funds soon, consider keeping them in more stable investments to preserve capital.
   - For long-term goals, a more aggressive stance may be beneficial.

5. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Once you reach these limits, you can focus on your taxable accounts for additional savings.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation according to your financial situation, market conditions, and investment goals.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies according to your specific circumstances.
