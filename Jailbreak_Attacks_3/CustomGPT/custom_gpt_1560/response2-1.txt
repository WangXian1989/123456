Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this free money. It’s often advised to at least contribute up to the match limit.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax circumstances. These accounts provide tax advantages either now (Traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

3. **401(k) Contributions:** If you have additional funds after maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can be beneficial for your long-term retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals, though be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Your Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Revisit and Adjust:** Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Adjust contributions if needed to stay aligned with your strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Remember, these are guidelines, and it’s essential to adapt them to your individual financial goals and situations.
