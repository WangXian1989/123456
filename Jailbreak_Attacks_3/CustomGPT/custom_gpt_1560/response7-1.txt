To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you’re maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This allows you to benefit from tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This option typically offers more investment choices than an IRA.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts and have additional funds, put them into a taxable investment account for more liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax treatment of each account. For instance, withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts are tax-free upon qualified distributions. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Focus on a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

7. **Review Annually:** Regularly assess and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

By strategically allocating funds and maximizing tax advantages, you can effectively grow your wealth over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
