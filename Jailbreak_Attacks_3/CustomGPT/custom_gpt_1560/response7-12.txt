I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver problems. It's crucial that you consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific condition. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, as well as avoiding alcohol and reducing sugar intake.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the nature of your liver issue, medications such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases might be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies help monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Avoiding Toxic Substances**: It's important to stay away from alcohol, certain medications, and environmental toxins that can worsen liver function.

5. **Weight Management**: For conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, weight loss through diet and exercise can significantly improve liver health.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary if the liver is significantly damaged and not functioning properly.

Always discuss with your doctor to tailor treatment to your individual health needs.
