The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement can be especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve funded your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to reach the maximum limit, particularly if you’re in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can be beneficial for flexible withdrawal options and managing tax impacts from capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation across all accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. This might mean holding different investments in your taxable accounts that can be more tax-efficient.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in the market, your life circumstances, and goals.

It might be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal situation.
