To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're under 50, contribute the maximum allowed (up to $22,500 for 2024). If you're over 50, you can make catch-up contributions ($7,500 in 2024).
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2024.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but be aware of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals. Generally, consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes) and safer assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Monitor Tax Implications**: Pay attention to how your investment decisions impact your taxes, especially in your taxable accounts. Aim for tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation annually or after significant life changes. Adjust contributions to reflect changing goals, retirement plans, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
