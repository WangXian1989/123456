Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. These grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term**: You might want to keep more in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification of Assets**
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance. For example:
     - **401(k)**: Consider low-cost index funds.
     - **IRA**: Depending on your strategy, use a mix of stocks and bonds.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation at least annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances can greatly influence the best strategy, so consider professional advice for tailored guidance.

By using a balanced approach and considering financial implications, you can optimize your distributions across these accounts.
