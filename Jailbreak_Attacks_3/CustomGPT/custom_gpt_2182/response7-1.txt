To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize employer matches**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: Once you've secured the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Consider your tax situation**: Place investments with higher potential for growth (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where you won't face immediate capital gains taxes. Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify investments**: Ensure you maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as your investments grow or as you near retirement.

6. **Withdrawal strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax optimization.
