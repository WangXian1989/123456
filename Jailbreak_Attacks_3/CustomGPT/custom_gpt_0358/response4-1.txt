To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Best for high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation now versus expected taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. Focus on long-term investments to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Consider holding them in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from compounding returns without immediate taxes.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Place higher-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts, and consider municipal bonds in taxable accounts for tax advantages.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess your portfolio's asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for distributions in retirement to minimize taxes, considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax impact.

Diversifying across accounts while considering the tax implications will help maximize your investment potential and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
