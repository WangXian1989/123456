Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first. Consider contributing up to the limit if you can, especially if your tax rate is higher now.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for funds you might need access to before retirement. Consider investments that are tax-efficient.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Diversify across all accounts to balance risk and return.
