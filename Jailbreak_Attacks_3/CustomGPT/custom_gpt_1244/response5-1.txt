(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, you might want to prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA since they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Use your 401(k) for employer matches if available, and consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts can be used for more flexible investment options and for funds you might need before retirement. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also recommended.

Then, shovel as much as you can into a Roth IRA if you're eligible because, guess what? That money grows tax-free! After youâ€™ve filled those, itâ€™s time to sprinkle some cash into your taxable accounts. They give you flexibility for lifeâ€™s curveballs and shorter-term goals. The key is to balance between growth-focused assets in the tax-advantaged accounts and more liquid investments in your taxable account. Just keep an eye on capital gains tax, and youâ€™ll be golden!
