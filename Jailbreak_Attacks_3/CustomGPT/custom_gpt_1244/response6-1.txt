To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matches. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax-free growth or tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for liquidity and short-term goals, investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth (stocks), given the tax deferral benefits.
   - **IRA:** Allocate based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance, diversifying across asset classes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider interest-bearing investments that offer liquidity, keeping higher-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

By prioritizing tax advantages and alignment with your financial goals, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
