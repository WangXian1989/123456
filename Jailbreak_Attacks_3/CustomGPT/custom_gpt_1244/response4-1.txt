Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Contribute enough to maximize any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Consider prioritizing this account if you have a high contribution limit and tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - If you're eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A traditional IRA can be beneficial if you want tax-deductible contributions now, but keep in mind the taxes due on withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or investments that may require liquidity.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Overall Strategy**:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there's a match.
- Fund your IRA (Roth or traditional) next based on your income and tax situation.
- Lastly, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

Always tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation or consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
