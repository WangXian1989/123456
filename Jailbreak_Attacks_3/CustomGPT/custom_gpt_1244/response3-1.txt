Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short to medium term. This can offer more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Evaluate how withdrawals from these accounts will affect your tax situation in retirement. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA), and then tax-free (Roth IRA).

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly reassess your allocation based on market conditions, changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
