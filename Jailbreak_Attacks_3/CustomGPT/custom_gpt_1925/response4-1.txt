Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you can, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k)s. Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income. Taxes are due on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to 401(k); contributions may also be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when investments are sold. They offer flexibility and no contribution limits.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in your taxable accounts for liquidity needs.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**
   - As you approach retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and consider how and when to withdraw funds to optimize tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
The best strategy varies based on individual circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can help you create a personalized plan that considers your unique situation and goals.
