To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you can afford to, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Focus on holding investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, favor tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to grow investments without immediate tax consequences.
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep lower-growth, income-generating investments (bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to potentially minimize tax burdens.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seeking professional advice can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This distribution strategy aims to optimize tax efficiency while building your retirement savings effectively.
