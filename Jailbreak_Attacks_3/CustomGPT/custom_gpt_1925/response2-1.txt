Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best strategy:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offered by employers, these accounts may come with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth like a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you want tax benefits now or later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on earnings. They’re suitable for short-term goals or investments you may need to access before retirement.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match (if available) to take full advantage of free money.
   - After that, consider fully funding a Roth IRA (if you qualify) or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement strategy.

### 3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re younger and have a long time to invest, lean towards aggressive growth in a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.
   - As you approach retirement, shift assets toward more conservative investments to reduce risk.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial as it allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - For lower-income years, consider converting a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA at a lower tax rate.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Allocate a variety of investments across all accounts: stocks, bonds, and alternative investments to balance risk and return.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds and index funds.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio’s performance and asset allocation. Rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you navigate complex tax implications and tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

### Example Strategy:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions to the employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA.
3. Allocate any additional funds to your taxable account, focusing on low-turnover investments.

By considering all these factors, you can create a distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your investment potential.
