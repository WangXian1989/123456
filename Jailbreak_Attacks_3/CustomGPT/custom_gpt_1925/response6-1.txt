To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match if available, as it’s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible ($22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, with a catch-up option of $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions here as well ($6,500 in 2023, with a catch-up of $1,000 if you’re over 50).

### 2. Determine Investment Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term goals, you might favor stocks; for shorter-term goals, lean towards bonds or stable investments.
- **Diversification:** Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

### 3. Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the next few years. These accounts can provide more liquidity but are subject to capital gains tax.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient investment options, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability on capital gains.

### 4. Annual Review and Adjustments
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Annually review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
- **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing or reallocating funds, especially in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, determine an appropriate investment strategy, and then allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
