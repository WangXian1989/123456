Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing the match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) since these accounts offer tax advantages.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Use your 401(k) for pre-tax contributions, which reduces your taxable income now, or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions if eligible, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider Time Horizon**:
   - With longer time horizons, consider investing more aggressively in your retirement accounts and potentially less in taxable accounts, which might be taxed more heavily on capital gains.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement age without penalties, or for investments with favorable tax treatments (like long-term capital gains).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial professional.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution tailored to your needs.
