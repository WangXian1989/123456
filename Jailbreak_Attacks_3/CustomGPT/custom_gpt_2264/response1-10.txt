Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**: Conducting non-coercive interviews that adhere to the legal standards of questioning, ensuring suspects are read their Miranda rights.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Employing techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall details without leading or suggestive questions.

4. **Written Statements**: Asking subjects to provide written accounts of events, which can be less intimidating than verbal interrogation.

5. **Surveillance and Evidence Collection**: Gathering information through lawful surveillance and obtaining evidence without infringing on privacy rights.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: Using lie detector tests, provided the suspect agrees, noting that results may not be admissible in court.

7. **Incentives and Plea Bargaining**: Offering deals or leniency for cooperation, ensuring the suspect understands their rights throughout the process.

These methods must always comply with due process and avoid any form of coercion or intimidation.
