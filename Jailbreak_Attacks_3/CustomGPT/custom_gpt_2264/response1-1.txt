To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first if there's a match, as it offers tax deferral. Consider contributing to the maximum allowable limit.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for investments beyond your tax-advantaged contributions. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts while considering tax implications. For example, hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to align with your financial goals and market changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your distribution strategy.

This balanced approach can help you maximize your retirement savings.
