Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional/Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: After the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) if you haven’t reached the contribution limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds to taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 4. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Optimized Investments**: In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Bonds**: Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Assess Your Goals**
   - Adjust your distribution based on your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and how soon you plan to access the funds.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess**
   - Review your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes to ensure it still meets your needs.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match, then consider contributing up to the limit.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Fund after tax-advantaged accounts are maximized.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your situation, especially regarding tax implications.
