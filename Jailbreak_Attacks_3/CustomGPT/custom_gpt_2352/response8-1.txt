The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you have high earning years, prioritize contributions here to lower your tax burden.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, meaning qualified withdrawals are tax-free; this can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Investment Growth**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to shield them from taxes during accumulation.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, and for shorter-term goals.

5. **Balance and Diversify**: Ensure you're diversified across all accounts. Avoid over-concentration in a single investment or type of investment (such as stocks or bonds) in any one account.

6. **Adjust As Needed**: Re-evaluate your strategy periodically (at least annually) to account for changes in income, expenses, and life goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial professional can help align your distribution strategy with your overall financial goals and circumstances.

By considering these factors and creating a balanced approach, you can optimize your contributions to each type of account and support your long-term financial well-being.
