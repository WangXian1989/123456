Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's usually best to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level. 

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments within each account type to balance risk and return. Use index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like a Traditional IRA or 401(k), and finally tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA.

4. **Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments, while tax-advantaged accounts offer different tax benefits. Coordinate your investment strategy to minimize taxes over time.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, making adjustments as necessary based on changing market conditions or life circumstances.

6. **Consultation with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs, as individual situations can greatly vary.

By following these strategies, you can create an optimal distribution of your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals and needs.
