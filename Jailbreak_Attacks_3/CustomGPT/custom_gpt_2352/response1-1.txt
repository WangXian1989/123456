When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and will be taxed on dividends and interest income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. 401(k) and IRAs are generally meant for retirement savings, while taxable accounts may be more suitable for short-term needs.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. Maxing out company match in a 401(k) can be an effective first step. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate funds in a diversified manner across different asset classes. Higher-risk investments might suit long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, while more liquid, stable investments might be better for taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Needs**:
   - Plan for when you might need to access the money. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

A balanced approach might involve maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the company match, fully funding an IRA, and then allocating any surplus to your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
