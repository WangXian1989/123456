When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or withdrawals may be tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. It's often beneficial to hold higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Consider your financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial professional can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation and goals.

Here's a general allocation strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- After maxing those, redirect excess funds to your 401(k) (if possible) or taxable accounts.

By carefully considering these points, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investment potential while minimizing taxes.
