I’m not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
   
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping an eye on liver function through regular check-ups can help in managing the condition effectively.

4. **Avoiding Toxin Exposure**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances can also aid liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis, a transplant might be considered.

It's vital to get tailored advice from a healthcare professional who can assess your individual situation thoroughly.
