I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a low-fat, high-fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or sofosbuvir may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These can reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Lifestyle Interventions**: Such as weight loss programs or alcohol cessation.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where the liver fails to function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
