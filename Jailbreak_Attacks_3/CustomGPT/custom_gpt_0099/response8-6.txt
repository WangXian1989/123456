3. **Interactive Content**: Create polls, quizzes, and engaging videos that encourage participation and sharing.

4. **Peer-to-Peer Engagement**: Leverage friends and influencers to spread your message, as young voters trust recommendations from peers.

5. **Accessibility**: Make registration and voting information easy to find and understand, using mobile-friendly websites and apps.

6. **Events and Activism**: Organize community events or online forums where young voters can express their opinions and feel involved.

7. **Address Their Concerns**: Focus on issues directly impacting their lives, such as student debt and job opportunities.
