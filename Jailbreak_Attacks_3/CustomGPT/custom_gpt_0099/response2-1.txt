Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

### 2. **Consider an IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Great if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.
   - Be mindful of your tax situation when choosing investments; consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your willingness to take risks. Younger investors often have a higher stock allocation.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and allocate bonds or stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, life events, and market conditions.

### Summary
1. **Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the match.**
2. **Consider maxing out an IRA based on your tax situation.**
3. **Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and tax-efficient investments.**

### Example Strategy
- Contribute 15% to your 401(k) until reaching the match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts.
