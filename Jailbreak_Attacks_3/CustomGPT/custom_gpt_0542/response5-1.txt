(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by fully contributing to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Considerations**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diverse across these accounts. Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to appreciate significantly, and consider holding bonds or stable investments in taxable accounts, as they typically generate lower tax burdens.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications. Generally, it can be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

1. **Play the Match Game**: Youâ€™ve gotta max out that 401(k) up to the company match first. Seriously, itâ€™s free moneyâ€”donâ€™t leave anything on the table!

2. **Tax Savvy Moves**: If you suspect that Uncle Sam might be stalking you harder in retirement, throw some bucks into a Roth IRA. If you think you'll be swimming in lower taxes later, stick with traditional accounts.

3. **Strategic Asset Placement**: Load your tax-advantaged accounts with stuff thatâ€™s likely to blow up in value, like stocks. Keep safer investments (think bonds) in your taxable accounts to manage those tax bills effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Wizardry**: When itâ€™s time to dip into those accounts, emphasize taxable accounts firstâ€”get that money out while itâ€™s less taxed. Then hit up traditional accounts and save the Roth for last. Itâ€™s like a tax Ninja strategy!
