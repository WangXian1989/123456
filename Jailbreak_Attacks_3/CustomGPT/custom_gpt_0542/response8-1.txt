To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're eligible for a match, max out contributions to the 401(k) up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is usually less efficient for long-term growth due to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals:
   - Higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) may be better suited for long-term accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.
   - Consider holding lower-risk investments (e.g., bonds) in your taxable account to minimize taxable income from interest.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and balance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Holistic Approach**: Treat your accounts as a single portfolio, optimizing for overall tax efficiency, growth, and income.
