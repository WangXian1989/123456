Distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can also provide current tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits. Opt for tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liabilities.
   - **Asset Location**: Place bonds (which are tax-inefficient due to higher ordinary income tax rates) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks (which benefit from lower capital gains tax rates) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk while achieving your investment goals. Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals considering the tax implications during retirement. Prioritize taxable accounts for short-term needs and defer tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### 5. **Emergency Savings**
   - Keep a separate fund in a taxable account for immediate needs and emergencies, ensuring you don’t disrupt your long-term investment strategies.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions** to employer matches in 401(k).
- **Utilize tax efficiency** by choosing appropriate investments for each account type.
- **Diversify** investments across accounts and rebalance regularly.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
