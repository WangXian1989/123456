Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline on how to approach this:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Take advantage of the higher contribution limits in a 401(k) compared to IRAs. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits:** A traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - **Investment Options:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Investment in taxable accounts provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

### Suggested Order of Contributions
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**
2. **Contribute to Traditional or Roth IRA up to the limit**
3. **Continue to Contribute to 401(k) up to maximum limit**
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for additional savings or after-tax goals**

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Adjust contributions based on how close you are to retirement.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance in each account type.
- **Financial Goals:** Align your contributions with specific financial goals, like buying a house or funding education.
