Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan, often with a matching contribution. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** You can choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (after-tax). Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but flexibly withdraw funds. Interest and capital gains are taxed in the year they’re realized.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50+). 
   - Either $6,500 for a Traditional or Roth IRA (or $7,500 if 50+).

### 3. **Sequence Your Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (especially if you prefer tax-free growth with a Roth).
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** Once your IRA is maxed, return to the 401(k) and contribute more, up to the limit.

### 4. **Investment Choices:**
   - **401(k):** Generally offers limited investment choices, often mutual funds. Choose a mix aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** More investment options, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. Build a diversified portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable gains.

### 5. **Monitor Your Tax Situation:**
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income. Plan distributions strategically to minimize tax burden in retirement.
   - Consider capital gains tax when selling assets in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Adjust for Goals and Timeline:**
   - If retirement is decades away, you might favor growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As retirement approaches, shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level, adjusting for market changes or life events.

### Example Strategy:
- **Age 30-40:** Focus on maxing out 401(k) to get employer match, contribute to Roth IRA, then increase 401(k) contributions.
- **Age 40-50:** Continue with above strategy but lean more towards a diversified IRA and taxable environment for liquidity.
- **Age 50+:** Shift toward a conservative allocation, ensuring that both 401(k) and IRA funds are ready for retirement withdrawals.

### Conclusion:
Your situation may differ, so it’s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor this general approach to your specific needs, especially considering changes in tax laws or personal financial circumstances.
