Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you effectively allocate your funds:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to leverage tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access to cash.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on contributing enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider the type (traditional vs. Roth) based on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth but contributions are post-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for money you may need in the near term; however, be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Scheme Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts, balancing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer matching funds.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Max out IRA contributions if you qualify; this can provide additional tax benefits.
- **Adjust for Flexibility**: If you have significant savings, consider keeping a portion in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Final Thoughts
- Regularly review your strategy, especially as tax laws and personal circumstances change.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice considering your unique situation.

This balanced approach will help you leverage tax advantages while ensuring liquidity when needed.
