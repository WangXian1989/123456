To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions; this is free money. Focus on higher-growth investments here due to tax-deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider maxing it out for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA can also be beneficial depending on your income level.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover funds or municipal bonds to minimize taxes on capital gains and interest.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your time horizon and risk tolerance. Allocate more aggressively in longer-term accounts (like 401(k) or Roth IRA) and balance against safe investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k)), and reserve Roth IRA withdrawals for last to maximize tax-free growth.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation and long-term goals. 

This approach provides tax advantages while aligning with your retirement objectives.
