The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) contributions, as they offer tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you're looking for flexibility or have already maxed out other accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed in the year they're realized, and investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains tax.

### 3. **Balance Investments**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts rather than isolating each account.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. **Long-Term Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings while considering how and when you want to access taxable accounts for other goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (until you reach the match limit)
- **IRA**: 10% of income (max out contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining savings after maxing out above accounts

### Regular Review
Regularly review your plan based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

**Consider consulting a financial advisor** to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and optimize tax benefits.
