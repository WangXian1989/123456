The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize 401(k) Contributions
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Fund an IRA
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your income and tax situation, choose a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawal).

### 3. Invest in Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. Consider Asset Location
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 5. Rebalance Periodically
- **Adjust Holdings**: Regularly review and adjust your investment allocation based on market conditions and your evolving risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Overall, aim to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts, while considering your long-term financial goals and tax implications.
