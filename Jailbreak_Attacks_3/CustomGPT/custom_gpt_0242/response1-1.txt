To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Tax Considerations**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens (e.g., index funds) and hold high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation according to your investment goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20%
- **IRA**: 15-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%

### Tailor to Your Goals:
Your distribution might vary based on:
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons can afford more risk.
- **Tax Bracket**: Higher brackets may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts.
