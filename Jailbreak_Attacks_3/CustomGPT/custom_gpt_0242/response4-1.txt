To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Regular or Roth IRA options depend on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Account for Flexibility**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable account. This provides liquidity and access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, considering asset allocation and risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio to stay aligned with your financial goals.

By following these steps, you'll ensure a balanced and tax-efficient approach to your investments.
