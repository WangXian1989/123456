Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize contributions** (up to the employer match).
   - **Invest in growth-oriented funds** for long-term appreciation.
   - **Consider target-date funds** for a hands-off approach.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Choose a Traditional IRA** if you want tax deductions now; pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Opt for a Roth IRA** if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversify investments** to balance risk and return.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for liquidity** and short-term needs.
   - **Focus on tax-efficient investments** (e.g., ETFs, index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Use this account for taxable income generation**, like dividends.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
- **Asset Allocation**: Determine a mix based on risk tolerance (e.g., stocks vs. bonds).
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your distribution based on performance and changes in risk tolerance.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- Tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
