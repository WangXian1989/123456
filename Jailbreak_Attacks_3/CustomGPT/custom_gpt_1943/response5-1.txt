To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full match.** This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**
   - **Contribute to your IRA.** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Balance contributions** between a traditional and Roth IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Use taxable accounts for additional savings.** Investments here arenâ€™t tax-deferred; however, you can access them without penalties before retirement age.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds)** should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Tax-efficient investments (like stocks)** can go into taxable accounts.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - **Short-term goals:** Use taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - **Review your allocations** periodically to adjust for market changes and life events.

### Conclusion
Always tailor your strategy based on your individual financial situation, retirement timeline, and investment goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
