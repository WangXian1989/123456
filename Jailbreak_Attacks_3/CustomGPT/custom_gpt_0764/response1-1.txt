To effectively distribute your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Pre-Tax Accounts (401(k))**: Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year.
   - **Utilize Roth Accounts (IRA or 401(k))**: If eligible, consider Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically limited to employer-selected funds; focus on diversified options or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers a broader range of investments. Consider using this account for riskier, high-growth investments since it's protected from taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or can be taxed favorably, such as long-term capital gains. Keep cash or lower-growth investments here to manage tax implications.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a cash reserve outside these accounts for immediate needs, ensuring that retirement accounts remain untouched until needed.

4. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Match your investment strategy to your timeline and risk tolerance. Long-term growth should be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on market performance, changes in your life situation, and financial goals.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs and balance contributions to take full advantage of these limits each year.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
