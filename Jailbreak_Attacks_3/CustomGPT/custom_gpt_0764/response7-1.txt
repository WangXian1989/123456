Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional) to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction.

3. **Continue Montoring 401(k)**: If you have additional funds to invest, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can also provide tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk. This should align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and investments to adjust for market changes, life events, or shifts in your financial goals.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
