To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions:** If you have additional funds after maximizing the employer match, contribute the maximum to your 401(k) since it has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

3. **IRA Contributions:** Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more advantageous based on your current and expected future tax situation. Contribute to the IRA if you can, as it provides tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Diversification Among Accounts:** Ensure that your investment allocation is diverse across all accounts to reduce risk. Different accounts may have different tax treatments, impacting how you should allocate investments.

6. **Adjust Based on Tax Efficiency:** Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while keeping less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Reassessment:** Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, financial goals, and market performance.

Consulting a financial advisor may also help tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
