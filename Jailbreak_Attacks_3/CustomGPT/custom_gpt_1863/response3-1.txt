Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a simple breakdown:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
- **Contribution Limits:** Max out to take advantage of employer matches.
- **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
- **Investment Choices:** Often limited compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
- **Tax Treatment:**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits:** Lower than 401(k), but can be a great second option.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** No contribution limits; can withdraw anytime.
- **Tax Implications:** Capital gains taxes on profits; consider investments that minimize taxes.

### **Strategy Recommendations**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k) to get the full employer contribution.
- **Consider Tax Diversification:** Balance between Traditional and Roth IRAs based on expected future tax rates.
- **Build Taxable Account Gradually:** For short- and medium-term goals or emergencies.

### **Final Tips**
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investment choices align with your comfort level.
- **Regular Review:** Adjust your allocations based on financial goals and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice based on your total financial picture.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing taxes efficiently.
