Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a simplified approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If eligible, this allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Great for tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Flexibility**: Accessible without penalties, great for short-term needs or goals.
   - **Priority for Lower Tax**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes on gains.

### **General Considerations**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies.
- **Goal Setting**: Define short-term vs. long-term goals to guide your investment choices.
- **Tax Implications**: Consider tax brackets and plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement.

### **Sample Allocation**
- **Aggressive**: 60% 401(k), 30% IRA, 10% Taxable
- **Conservative**: 40% 401(k), 40% IRA, 20% Taxable

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- Tailor your plan based on personal circumstances for the best outcome.
