Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
  
### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you need a tax deduction now, a Traditional IRA might be better. 

### 3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**
   - **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:** Before maxing out retirement accounts, pay off any high-interest debt.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Maintain 3-6 months of expenses in an easily accessible account.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest Beyond Retirement Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments, offering flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Diversified Investments:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Plan:** A financial advisor can help tailor your distribution strategy based on your unique situation.
