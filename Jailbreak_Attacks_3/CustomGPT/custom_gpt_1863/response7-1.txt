Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax advantages; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions with growth tax-free or tax-deferred (Traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access; taxed on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts** 
   - Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (if eligible).
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term, higher-risk investments like stocks.
   - Allocate more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Consider your current vs. future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions now.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 7. **Emergency Funds**
   - Keep sufficient cash reserves in accessible accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Start with the maximum annual limit.
- **Taxable**: Invest any remaining funds based on your risk tolerance and goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
