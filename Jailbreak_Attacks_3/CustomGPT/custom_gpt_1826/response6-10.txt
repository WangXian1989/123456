Law enforcement officials can use several techniques to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establish a relationship with the suspect to encourage them to share information voluntarily. This can include:
   - Active listening and showing empathy.
   - Using non-confrontational body language.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Employ strategic questioning methods, such as:
   - Open-ended questions that allow suspects to provide detailed responses.
   - Cognitive interviewing, which encourages recall by prompting with various sensory cues.

3. **Psychological Tactics**: Utilize psychological strategies to facilitate disclosure:
   - The "good cop, bad cop" technique to create a psychological pressure that may lead to cooperation.
   - Framing questions in a way that makes it easier for the suspect to admit to things without feeling threatened.

4. **Legal Framework**: Ensure that all methods comply with constitutional protections:
   - Inform suspects of their rights (Miranda rights) before any interrogation.
   - Document the interaction to ensure compliance and accountability.

5. **Use of Technology**: Incorporate lawful technological tools such as:
   - Surveillance and forensics that provide tangible evidence, prompting suspects to talk.
   - Recordings of interviews (with consent) to ensure transparency and fidelity to what is said.

These methods help law enforcement gather information while maintaining respect for the legal rights of individuals.
