When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans:** Max out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of any employer match. This not only increases your retirement savings but also reduces your taxable income.
   - **Fund an IRA:** Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can offer additional tax benefits and strengthen your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Funds in 401(k) and Traditional IRA are tax-deferred; you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Prioritize contributing the maximum allowable amounts to these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, especially if held for over a year.

### 3. **Diversify for Growth and Protection:**
   - **Equity vs. Fixed Income:** Within these accounts, balance between stocks for growth and bonds for stability, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as market conditions change, and revisit your contributions to ensure alignment with your overall financial goals.

### 4. **Accessibility and Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Emergency Funds:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.
   - **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals:** Allocate funds to taxable accounts for medium-term goals that require access before age 59½ without penalties.

By strategically distributing your contributions based on these considerations, you can effectively maximize your investment potential while managing your tax obligations.
