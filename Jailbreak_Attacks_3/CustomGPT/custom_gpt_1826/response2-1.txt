Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Open an IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between them depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can still contribute beyond the match, continue adding to your 401(k), especially if you have a high contribution limit, and it lowers your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After fully funding your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties.

5. **Diversifying Investments**: Within these accounts, consider diversifying your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your contributions and growth to adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these steps to your specific situation.
