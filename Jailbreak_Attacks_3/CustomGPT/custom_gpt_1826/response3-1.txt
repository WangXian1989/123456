Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantage:** Contributions are made pre-tax (in traditional 401(k)s), reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Identify Contribution Type:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** If you're eligible, try to max out your IRA contributions each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties. Consider these for goals outside retirement or for emergency savings.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Goals:** Allocate more towards taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Medium to Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth potential while considering your tax bracket and withdrawal needs.

### Regular Review:
- **Rebalance Periodically:** Review your allocations annually and adjust based on market performance, changes in income, and shifts in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this plan to your specific circumstances.
