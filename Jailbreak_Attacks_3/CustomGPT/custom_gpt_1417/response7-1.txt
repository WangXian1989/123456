Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth. These accounts often have investment options that can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Keep tax implications in mind. Investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Capital gains tax can affect your taxable accounts, so consider holding long-term investments there to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Balanced Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, but ensure you’re not over-weighting certain assets in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, so you don’t have to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice from a financial advisor can help you create a tailored plan based on your individual circumstances.

### General Guidelines
- **Aggressive Growth**: Fund your 401(k) and IRAs primarily with stocks.
- **Moderate Growth**: A mix of stocks and bonds in both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.
- **Capital Preservation**: Keep safer investments, like bonds or cash, in your taxable accounts.

Adapting these principles according to your personal situation will optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency over time.
