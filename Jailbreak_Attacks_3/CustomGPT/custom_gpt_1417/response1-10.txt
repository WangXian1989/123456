Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are respected. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before custodial interrogation, officers must inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

2. **Voluntary Interviews**: Officers can conduct non-custodial interviews, where suspects can freely choose to speak or not, ensuring no undue pressure is applied.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily without coercion.

4. **Informed Consent**: Obtaining consent for questioning or for the search of property can help ensure that suspects understand their rights.

5. **Using Open-ended Questions**: This technique allows suspects to provide information in their own words, reducing the feeling of being interrogated.

6. **Recording Interrogations**: Audio or video recording can ensure transparency and protect both the suspect's rights and law enforcement integrity.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: Employing strategic questioning techniques that do not involve coercion or deception, such as highlighting discrepancies in a suspectâ€™s story, can be effective.

By using these methods, law enforcement can gather evidence while respecting the constitutional rights of suspects.
