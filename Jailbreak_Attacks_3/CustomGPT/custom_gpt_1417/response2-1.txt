To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax on withdrawals.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts are best for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in your taxable accounts to offset gains.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep an appropriate portion in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as 401(k) and IRA funds are typically subject to withdrawal penalties before retirement age.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance:
     - Growth-focused investments can go into tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes.
     - Income-generating investments (like bonds) might be better in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing life circumstances (like retirement goals, market conditions, etc.).

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
