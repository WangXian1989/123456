When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Traditional accounts reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in your taxable account. This money should be easily accessible without penalties.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that provide liquidity and can be accessed without penalties, such as stocks or bonds.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific goals and risk profile.
