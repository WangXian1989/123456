To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Use for investments that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds), reducing immediate tax liability.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on capital gains-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) which will be taxed at lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, ensuring a mix of equities and fixed income.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level as market conditions change.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing your tax burden.
