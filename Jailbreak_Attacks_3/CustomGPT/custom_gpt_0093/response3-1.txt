To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with pre-tax contributions. Good for long-term growth and often offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for investing without the contribution limits of retirement accounts, but gains are taxed.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Fund your IRA after maximizing the 401(k) match. Choose between a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rate.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. This can be beneficial for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to the funds sooner.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of how each account grows and is taxed when you withdraw funds. For example, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your investment strategy and asset allocation annually or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and long-term goals.

By following these steps, you can ensure a balanced and strategic approach to managing your investments across different account types.
