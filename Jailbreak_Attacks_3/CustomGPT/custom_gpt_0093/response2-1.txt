Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to optimize tax efficiency and achieve your financial goals. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contribution**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributionsâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit to benefit from tax deferrals.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or long-term holdings.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for short-term savings or emergency funds, as they offer liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compounding tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep interest-bearing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to manage your tax bracket effectively. Consider drawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations and contributions regularly based on your financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
