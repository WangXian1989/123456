To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out any employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility but incur capital gains taxes. Prioritize these for investments with high growth potential.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Timeline**: Funds in a 401(k) and IRAs are typically for retirement. Determine how long until you need to withdraw.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Higher risk investments might be better suited for long-term accounts, whereas more conservative investments can be held in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions if possible.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across account types. This helps balance risk and optimize returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Consider when you'll need access to funds. Taxable accounts are best for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are better for long-term growth.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

By taking these factors into account, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
