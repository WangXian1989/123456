Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be advantageous depending on your income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility and liquidity.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, considering tax implications on withdrawals.

### 6. **Review Investment Time Horizon**
   - Short-term needs should be in safer investments. Long-term goals can handle more volatility.

### 7. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% (to max out the employer match)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 10% (considering tax implications)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 5% (after maxing tax-advantaged accounts)

### Consultation
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
