To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Good for long-term retirement savings.
- **IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), with potential for a wider range of investment options.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals and investment, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
- **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**:
  - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.
  - **Traditional IRA**: Good for reducing taxable income now, benefitting from tax-deferred growth.

### 3. Allocation Strategy
- **Aggressive Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on higher-risk, higher-reward investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA.
- **Income and Low-risk in Taxable Accounts**: Allocate lower-risk investments (like bonds) to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

### 4. Annual Review and Rebalance
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) for employer match.
- Choose account types based on tax implications and future income expectations.
- Allocate investments based on risk and tax efficiency.

This balanced approach can help maximize growth while minimizing tax liability across your investment accounts.
