Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a house, or something else?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored, offering tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be matched by your employer.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that don’t have tax advantages but allow for more flexibility and access to funds.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out your employer 401(k) if they offer matching contributions (free money).
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond your retirement goals or for immediate expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment strategy that optimally utilizes each type of account.
