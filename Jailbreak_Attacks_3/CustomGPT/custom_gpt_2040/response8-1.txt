To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, ensure you at least contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, usually in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax but can grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings and dividends are subject to capital gains taxes, and interest income is taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you are younger and investing for a long time, you might prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth.
   - If you are closer to retirement, focus more on your taxable accounts for liquidity, while still maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), which helps manage risk.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s ($22,500 for under 50, $30,000 for 50+) and IRAs ($6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+).

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s) and then Roth accounts last.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By strategically allocating your investments this way, you can optimize your savings for retirement and potentially reduce your tax burden. If you have specific amounts or percentages in mind, adjusting based on your financial goals and immediate needs can further enhance your strategy.
