Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re age 50 or older). If you can afford to maximize this contribution, it's usually beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial as it allows for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). If you can’t max out your 401(k), consider putting additional funds into an IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in taxable accounts. Generally, a fund covering 3-6 months of expenses is recommended.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter than retirement or for investments that may provide tax advantages, such as tax-loss harvesting.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, so consider holding investments for longer periods.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your funds in all accounts are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk and optimize returns.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your investment performance, changes in your financial goals, and changes in tax laws.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these general guidelines to your specific situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial landscape and objectives.
