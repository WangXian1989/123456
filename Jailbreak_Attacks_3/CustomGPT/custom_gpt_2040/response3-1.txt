Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer match; contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). Traditional IRAs reduce taxable income now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages, but more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:** 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Focus on Tax Diversification:** 
   - Consider contributing to a mix of traditional and Roth accounts to provide tax flexibility in retirement. This strategy can help manage your tax bracket when you withdraw funds.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Deferred Accounts:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments like stocks since they are tax-deferred, allowing potential growth without immediate tax consequences.

5. **Consider Current and Future Tax Rates:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate a higher tax rate, contributing to a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

6. **Allocate Fixed Income/Taxable Investments to Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income, like bonds, or choose investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your circumstances and long-term goals, you can optimize your retirement savings and manage your tax burden effectively.
