When it comes to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy generally involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: 
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money that you shouldnâ€™t leave on the table.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to maximize your tax-advantaged savings.

2. **Consider your tax situation**:
   - A Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, which may be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Balance your investments**:
   - Keep an eye on the types of assets you hold in each account. For instance, it might be beneficial to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize their tax-free or tax-deferred growth, while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to potentially benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Regular rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across your accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

5. **Emergency fund**:
   - Before allocating large sums to retirement accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a highly liquid account.

By focusing on maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and carefully considering the mix of investments, you can create a solid foundation for your financial future. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
