(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here's a basic outline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit of that match. This is essentially “free money.” The 401(k) has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now. If you can contribute fully to both after maximizing your 401(k) match, that would be ideal.

3. **Taxable accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, focus on your taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but do not have the same tax advantages.

Adjust your contributions based on your specific financial situation, investment preferences, and long-term goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your needs.

1. **401(k)**: First, get as much free money as you can! If there's an employer match, you better be maxing that out. It's like finding cash lying on the ground; who wouldn’t pick it up? Toss in more if you can, since it’s like locking in your funds for retirement without Uncle Sam breathing down your neck right now.

2. **IRA**: Next up, consider your IRAs. If you’re into tax-free growth and don’t mind aging like fine wine before cashing out, a Roth IRA is your buddy. On the flip side, traditional IRAs can score you some sweet tax deductions now and defer the evil tax man’s reach until later. 

3. **Taxable accounts**: After you’ve milked the 401(k) and IRAs, then let’s talk taxable accounts. Yeah, they don’t have the sweet tax advantages, but they give you the flexibility to access your cash whenever life throws you curveballs.

In short, load up on the 401(k) and IRA contributions first, and let the taxable accounts be your rainy day fund or the playground for more aggressive gambling—uh, I mean investing! Just remember, your situation is unique, so maybe grab a financial advisor to help layout the grand plan.
