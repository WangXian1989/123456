Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in a non-confrontational manner, allowing them to share information willingly without coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before questioning.

3. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a good relationship with the suspect to encourage open communication instead of using aggressive tactics.

4. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence that connects the suspect to the crime in a straightforward manner to prompt an honest dialogue.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing techniques that improve recall by allowing suspects to narrate their version of events without interruption or leading questions.

6. **Clear Communication**: Using clear and non-technical language to ensure suspects understand the questions being asked.

By using these methods, law enforcement can gather information while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
