The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, but grow tax-free. Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth. If you qualify, consider a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or if you're planning to withdraw funds before retirement age, but investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re saving for retirement long-term, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax benefits. For shorter-term goals, consider a taxable account for more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy to your individual situation.
