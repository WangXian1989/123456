To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider placing higher-growth investments here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contributions can be tax-deductible (traditional IRA) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth IRA). If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in all accounts, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts provide easy access to cash for short-term needs, while retirement accounts should primarily fund long-term goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investments based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

By employing these strategies, you'll create a balanced approach to distributing your money that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
