The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that may generate higher taxable income, like bonds. This helps reduce your current taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investment choices across all accounts. Donâ€™t replicate the same investments in all three accounts to maximize risk management and tax efficiency.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. This may involve drawing down taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and minimizes tax implications.
