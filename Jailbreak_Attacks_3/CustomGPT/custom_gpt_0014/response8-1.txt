Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized the match, focus on contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax; consider holding tax-efficient investments here.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs since they are more accessible without penalties.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Consider your retirement timeline. If you're further away from retirement, you can be more aggressive with investment choices.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions and your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
