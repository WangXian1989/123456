Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected future tax situation:
   - **Roth IRA**: Good for younger investors expecting higher income later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Beneficial for those who want a tax deduction now.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once you've maximized your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for funds needed in the short term (like emergency savings) or for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust contributions/allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Each person's situation is unique. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically to your needs.
