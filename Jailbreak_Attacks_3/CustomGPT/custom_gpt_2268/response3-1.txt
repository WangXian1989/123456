To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following outline:

### **1. Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**
     - Employer-sponsored retirement account.
     - Contributions may be tax-deferred.
     - Employer match contributions (if offered).

   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
     - Can be traditional or Roth.
     - Traditional: tax-deferred growth, taxed on withdrawal.
     - Roth: contributions taxed, but withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free.

   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - Investments are taxed in the year realized (capital gains).
     - More flexible but subject to higher taxes on income and gains.

### **2. Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Determine your retirement age.
   - Identify your risk tolerance.
   - Clarify short-term vs. long-term needs.

### **3. Allocate Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**
     - Max out employer match in your 401(k).
     - Contribute to your IRA (preferably Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
     - Prioritize tax-deferred growth for higher-return investments.

   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - Use for investments that might generate capital gains (like stocks) and hold them long-term.
     - Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize tax implications.

### **4. Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - Match investments with your risk profile.

### **5. Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and emerging financial goals.

### **Example Allocation Strategy**
- **401(k): 40% of total investments**
- **IRA: 30% of total investments**
- **Taxable Accounts: 30% of total investments**

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- Consider personalized advice based on your financial situation.
