To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offered by employers, it may have matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not provide tax benefits but offer flexibility for withdrawals at any time.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Prioritize retirement savings while considering your liquidity needs. 

### 3. **Contribution Strategies**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for post-retirement savings or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) since these accounts have tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds, index funds, or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Summary:
- **Step 1**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- **Step 2**: Fund your IRA, ideally maximizing contributions.
- **Step 3**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on different asset types.
