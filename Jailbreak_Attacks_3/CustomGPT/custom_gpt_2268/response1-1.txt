To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### Outline

1. **Understand Account Types**
   - 401(k): Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer match.
   - IRA: Individual Retirement Account offering tax advantages.
   - Taxable Accounts: Investments subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Factors to Consider**
   - Contribution limits and tax implications.
   - Withdrawal rules and age restrictions.
   - Investment goals and risk tolerance.

3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - Prioritize employer match in 401(k).
   - Maximize IRA contributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Rebalancing and Adjustments**
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations.
   - Consider tax laws and market conditions.

### Details

1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers an employer match, which is free money. Contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth). Choose based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for more liquid investments. Taxes apply to dividends and capital gains, so be mindful of your investment choices.

2. **Factors to Consider**
   - Check the contribution limits for each account type.
   - Be aware of the penalties for early withdrawals.
   - Determine your investment horizon: short-term vs. long-term needs.

3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) enough to get the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **Diversify**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have high turnover or frequent withdrawals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing and Adjustments**
   - Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Stay informed about changes in tax laws that may affect your strategy.

### Conclusion

The best distribution strategy varies based on individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance. Regular reviews are crucial to adjust your approach based on life changes and financial goals.
