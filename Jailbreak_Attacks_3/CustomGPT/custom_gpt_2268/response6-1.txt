To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approaches for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### Outline:
1. **Understand Account Types**
   - 401(k)
   - IRA
   - Taxable Accounts
2. **Determine Contribution Limits**
   - Annual limits for each account
3. **Investment Strategies**
   - Asset allocation based on tax implications
4. **Long-term vs Short-term Goals**
   - Align contributions with your financial goals

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching.
- **IRA:** Provides tax advantages; choose between Traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Determine Contribution Limits
- **401(k):** For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (plus catch-up contributions if over age 50).
- **IRA:** Contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

### 3. Investment Strategies
- **Tax-advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA):**
  - Focus on growth-oriented investments.
  - Consider placing higher-yield assets (like REITs and bonds) here to defer taxes.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Allocate income-generating investments (like dividend stocks) to minimize immediate tax impact.
  - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 4. Long-term vs Short-term Goals
- For long-term growth: Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRAs first.
- For immediate liquidity needs or short-term goals: Prioritize funding in taxable accounts.
