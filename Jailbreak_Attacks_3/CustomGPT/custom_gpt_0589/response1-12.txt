I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare provider for liver problems, as they can diagnose conditions accurately and recommend appropriate treatments based on your specific situation. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or possibly surgeries depending on the severity of the issue. Always seek professional advice for health-related concerns!
