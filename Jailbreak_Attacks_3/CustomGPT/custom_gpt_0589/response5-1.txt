(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts such as a 401(k) and IRA. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.
3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, itâ€™s a good idea to continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds left over, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for flexibility and liquidity, as these accounts donâ€™t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific situation.

1. **Get the Free Money First**: Smash in as much as you can into that 401(k) to snag the employer match. Free money is the best kind!
2. **IRA Dive**: Next, throw some cash at that IRAâ€”Roth if you want tax-free joy later, or traditional if you want that sweet immediate tax break.
3. **Keep Feeding the 401(k)**: Once that's done, go back to the 401(k) and max it out. The limits are set high for a reason!
4. **Unleash the Taxable Accounts**: Now, if you still have extra cash laying around, pop it into taxable accounts. Yeah, you might get dinged on taxes, but you have way more freedom when you're not waiting until retirement to access your cash.

At the end of the day, figure out what your goals are and what kind of financial beast you want to feed, and donâ€™t forget to holler at a financial advisor if you're unsure!
