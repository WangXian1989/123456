Distributing your money effectively amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts primarily depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider contributing the maximum limit allowed, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Evaluate which type fits your tax situation better.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. These accounts provide liquidity and more flexibility to access your money without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Consider using a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations regularly and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

Each person's situation is unique, so it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
