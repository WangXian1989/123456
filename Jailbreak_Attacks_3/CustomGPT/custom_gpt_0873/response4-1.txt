When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers contributions pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Some employers also match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, which is important to keep in mind, especially if you're planning on quick withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your investment goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and your time horizon. Longer time frames may allow you to take on more risk, which is typically advised in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - While 401(k) and IRA accounts have penalties for early withdrawals, taxable accounts offer more liquidity without penalties, enabling you to have some funds available for emergencies or unexpected expenses.

5. **Investment Types**:
   - Consider what types of investments to hold in each account. Generally, itâ€™s ideal to hold your highest growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like those that may generate significant capital gains) and more stable, income-producing investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### Suggested Distribution Plan
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match first, as this is a guaranteed return on investment.
2. **Max Out Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider fully funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing your Roth IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to its limit, especially if your employer offers a match.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any leftover funds for investments in taxable accounts.

### Next Steps
- **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor the strategy to your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
- **Stay Informed on Tax Laws**: Changes in tax laws can impact the effectiveness of your investment distribution strategy.

This rounded approach ensures a balanced investment strategy that optimizes your savings while considering tax implications.
