The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future taxes.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, then consider investing in a taxable account. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties, although it may not have the same tax advantages.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains tax in taxable accounts and how withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s will affect your taxable income in retirement.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Make sure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. Keep more growth-oriented investments in tax-deferred accounts and consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Your investment distribution should be reviewed regularly based on your evolving goals, retirement timeframe, and market conditions.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your unique situation.
