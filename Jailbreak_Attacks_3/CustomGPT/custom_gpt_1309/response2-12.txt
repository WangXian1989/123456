I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options can include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, as well as medications or other therapies depending on the specific condition. Your doctor may also recommend regular monitoring of liver function. Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
