I'm not a doctor, but there are various treatments for liver problems depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include medication, dietary changes, lifestyle modifications, or, in severe cases, liver transplant. Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing any underlying conditions are generally beneficial. Please reach out to your doctor for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
