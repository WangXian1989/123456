The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as these contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since you pay taxes upfront and can withdraw tax-free later.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could offer immediate tax savings.

3. **Diversification and Accessibility:**
   - Allocate a portion of your funds to a taxable brokerage account for more flexibility. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you may need access to that money before retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. A longer time horizon generally allows for a more aggressive investment strategy.

5. **Regular Re-evaluation:**
   - Review and adjust your contributions and allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
