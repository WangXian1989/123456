Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match.** This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as 401(k)s typically have higher contribution limits than IRAs.
   - Focus on investments that fit your risk tolerance; many 401(k) plans offer diversified options.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're considering a Traditional IRA, assess whether you need the tax deduction. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, it might be a good idea.
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Max out IRA contributions if possible, as they can provide good growth opportunities.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments, such as stocks or mutual funds that you may need to access before retirement without penalties.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments; strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help minimize tax impacts.
   - This is a good place for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

**General Strategy:**
- Start by prioritizing employer-sponsored plans, especially if thereâ€™s a match.
- Then, contribute to IRAs to maximize tax-advantaged growth.
- Supplement with taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
- Review and adjust your allocations based on your changing circumstances, like age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
