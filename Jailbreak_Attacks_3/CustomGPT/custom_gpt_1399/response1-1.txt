Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if possible, focusing on pre-tax or Roth options based on your current tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Build a Taxable Account**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you expect to need liquidity before retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-efficient investment options in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Pay attention to your marginal tax rate when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.

4. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, based on changing market conditions and life circumstances.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to reduce risk.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, ensuring your investments remain untouched for growth.

Consider working with a financial advisor for a personalized approach based on your specific circumstances.
