Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps with tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible and can offer liquidity for goals outside retirement.

### Considerations:

- **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or income-generating investments could be held in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan based on when you need to access the funds. Tax-advantaged accounts typically incur penalties for early withdrawal.

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess and adjust your allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

### Conclusion:

Creating a balanced distribution tailored to your goals and needs is crucial. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
