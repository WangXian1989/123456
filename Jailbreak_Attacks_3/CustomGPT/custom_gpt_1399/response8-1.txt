Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matches, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in accounts for flexibility. You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before making substantial investments.

5. **Diversification & Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments in each account according to your risk tolerance, age, and investment goals.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
