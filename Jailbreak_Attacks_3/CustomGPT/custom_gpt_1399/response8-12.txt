I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing diseases like hepatitis, diabetes, or obesity can improve liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options may be considered.

Always ensure to seek medical advice tailored to your situation.
