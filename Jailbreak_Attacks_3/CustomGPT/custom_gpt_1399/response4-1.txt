Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions. Consider contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high levels of taxable income (e.g., bonds) or for savings that you might need access to before retirement.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investment choices across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it’s beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Consult a Professional**: 
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

This approach leverages the benefits of each type of account while aiming for growth and tax efficiency over time.
