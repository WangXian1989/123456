When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments at a profit. Dividends are taxed in the year they are received.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options chosen by your employer, while IRAs and taxable accounts often allow for a broader selection of investments.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Before distributing significant amounts to retirement accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Consider your retirement timeline. If you're more than 10 years away from retirement, you might prioritize growth in accounts with higher potential returns. As retirement nears, a conservative approach may be more appropriate.

6. **Overall Financial Goals**:
   - Evaluate your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you expect to need funds before retirement, a taxable account might be a better option for access.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Benefits**: Depending on your tax situation, you may want to contribute to a traditional IRA for the tax deduction or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments in all accounts based on performance and changes in financial goals or market conditions.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

It's essential to tailor your distribution strategy to your personal circumstances, so feel free to adjust the allocations as needed.
