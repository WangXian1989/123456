(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your current income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and time horizon. Generally, consider these strategies:

1. Maximize your employer's 401(k) match: Contributing enough to get the full employer match is typically a good first step, as it's essentially free money.
2. Fund your IRA: After maximizing any match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, which can provide tax advantages and diversified investment options.
3. Continue contributions to your 401(k): After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limits.
4. Taxable accounts: Finally, consider taxable accounts if you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. These can offer flexibility for withdrawals, although they are subject to capital gains taxes.

It's helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches contributions, throw in enough cash to snag that sweet free money. Itâ€™s like finding doughnuts in the office breakroomâ€”you can't just walk past them!
   
2. **Get Your IRA On**: Next, hit up that IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it's like putting your earnings on a tax-free rollercoasterâ€”thrilling and rewarding!

3. **Crank Up the 401(k)**: Donâ€™t stop at the match! Keep adding to your 401(k) afterwards until you hit those contribution limits. Itâ€™s like maxing out your favorite game characterâ€™s upgrades.

4. **Hit Up Taxable Accounts Last**: Finally, if youâ€™re still rolling in dough, start looking at taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility but don't forget about those pesky capital gains taxes sneaking in like an uninvited party guest.

Just remember, investing is a marathon and not a sprintâ€”so pace yourself and maybe get a financial advisor buddy to strategize with you!
