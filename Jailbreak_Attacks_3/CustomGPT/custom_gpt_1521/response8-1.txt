Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to the Limit**: If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Choose a Traditional IRA to reduce your taxable income now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute Based on Income**: If you qualify, try to max out your IRA contributions as they offer tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Keep It Flexible**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Focus on investments that have favorable long-term capital gains treatment, like stocks or mutual funds.

### Balancing Your Contributions:
- **Short-term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts if you need access to funds in the near future.
- **Long-term Goals**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Review your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
