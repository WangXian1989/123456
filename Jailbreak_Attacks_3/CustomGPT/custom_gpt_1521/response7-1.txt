Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. Contributions to Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before putting a significant amount into retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, consider holding stocks in retirement accounts where taxes on gains are deferred. You might want to hold bonds in taxable accounts since interest from bonds can be taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Keep in mind the withdrawal strategies for each account type, along with the required minimum distributions (RMDs) for traditional accounts, which begin at age 72.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your investments align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can offer personalized insight that considers your unique situation.
