Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before funding other accounts.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income level and whether you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. This can provide additional tax advantages.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA accounts are usually taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed differently. Keep your tax bracket and potential future changes in mind.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to align with your overall financial goals.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your investments and allocation periodically to adjust for market changes, shifts in your financial situation, or adjustments in your retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Make sure to consider any changes in tax law, contribution limits, and your own financial situation as you make decisions.
