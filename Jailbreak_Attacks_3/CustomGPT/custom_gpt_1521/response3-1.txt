The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with pre-tax contributions, offering tax-deferred growth. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, a Roth IRA can be advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each type of IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties. This can be beneficial for short-term financial goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments long-term to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
- **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Next, focus on your IRA contributions. Depending on your tax situation, you may want to prioritize either a Traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings**: Any additional funds can be allocated to a taxable account, particularly if you have maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **40% in 401(k)** (to secure employer match)
- **30% in IRA** (depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth)
- **30% in Taxable Account** (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

### Final Thoughts:
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific distribution strategy based on individual circumstances. They can provide guidance that considers your overall financial plan, risk tolerance, and investment strategy.
