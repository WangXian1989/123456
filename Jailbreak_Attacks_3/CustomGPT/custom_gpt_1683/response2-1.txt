The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on which one suits your tax situation and long-term goals best. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable investment accounts for money that you might need before retirement or for specific goals (e.g., buying a home or funding education). These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be a good place for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are appropriately diversified across all accounts. You may choose to hold different assets in each account based on the tax implications (e.g., holding bonds in a tax-advantaged account and stocks in a taxable account).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each type of account. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

6. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time before retirement, consider more aggressive growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts. If youâ€™re closer to retirement, a more conservative allocation could be beneficial.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable to tailor this strategy to your unique financial situation. They can help you create a comprehensive plan that aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.
