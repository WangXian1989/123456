Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investments**: Consider higher risk investments if it's a long-term account, as you wonâ€™t need to access it for many years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Prioritize this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. It's ideal if you think your tax rate will be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Funds here are accessible at any time without restrictions. It can be beneficial for medium-term goals (like buying a house) or if you need flexibility.
   - Consider municipal bonds or index funds to minimize tax implications.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially to get company matches.
- Next, focus on Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.
- Finally, allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Monitor and Adjust:
- Review your allocations annually and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.
