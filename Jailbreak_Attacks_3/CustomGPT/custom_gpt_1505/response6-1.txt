When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to take into account factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
  
2. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts where your investments can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - For shorter-term goals, such as saving for a home or a major purchase, focus on your taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider keeping bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Adjust Contributions as Needed**:
   - Regularly reevaluate your financial situation and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Working with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances.
