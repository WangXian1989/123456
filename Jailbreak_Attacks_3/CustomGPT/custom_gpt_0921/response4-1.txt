Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential match benefits. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are subject to capital gains tax when investments appreciate or when dividends are received. Flexible withdrawals but less tax-efficient.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: If you need funds within a few years, favor taxable accounts for liquidity. For long-term retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Retirement Timeline**: Younger savers may benefit from maxing tax-sheltered accounts. Nearing retirement? Consider a mix that ensures accessibility and tax efficiency.

### 3. **Maximize Account Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first—this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially for tax benefits.
   - Depending on your tax situation and investment strategy, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize annual tax liability.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Monitor your allocations annually or after major life changes (new job, marriage, etc.) to adapt your distribution strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match (e.g., 5-10%).
2. **IRA**: Aim to max out annual limits (e.g., $6,500 for under 50; $7,500 if over).
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional funds after maxing out employer match and IRA.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By employing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, aligned with your financial objectives.
