Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions first.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon sale. Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate dividends or interest.

### 2. **Retirement Goals**
   - If you're close to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth.
   - For early or mid-career, consider a balance between tax-advantaged and taxable accounts to maintain flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how much risk you can handle. Generally, more aggressive investments (stocks, ETFs) can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative options (bonds) can go into taxable accounts to better manage taxes on interest income.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of account type.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $19,500 for 401(k) (plus $6,500 catch-up if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up).

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get employer matches, then maximize full contribution if possible.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider a Roth IRA if eligible, then fund a traditional IRA to lower taxable income.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investment strategies (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions
- **IRA:** 30% of contributions
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of contributions

### User Input
- **1. Your current age and retirement timeline?**
