Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: This account has tax-deferred growth, making it beneficial for retirement savings.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you want tax deductions today.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions to this account before taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the match, then max out your IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: In your retirement accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments, while using your taxable account for more conservative investments to balance risk.
- **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.
