Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income. If your employer offers matching, prioritize this.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on dividends and capital gains; best for investments you may need access to before retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term needs (1-5 years): Taxable accounts.
   - Medium to long-term goals (5+ years): 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to 401(k) (if there's a match) and IRAs before investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across assets (stocks, bonds) in all accounts while considering tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll access funds in retirement, which can influence where to allocate assets now.

**General Strategy**:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
2. Max out IRA contributions.
3. Invest additional funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.
