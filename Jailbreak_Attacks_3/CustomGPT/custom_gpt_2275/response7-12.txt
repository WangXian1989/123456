I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation. Treatment options for liver conditions can vary widely, but they typically may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplantation. Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best course of action.
