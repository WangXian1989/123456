When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to take into account several factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be a smart choice.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), you can make pre-tax contributions, potentially helping to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in the future, this account may be more advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals but do not have the same tax benefits. They also incur capital gains tax on earnings.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term investments that may be more volatile, as these accounts have tax benefits that can enhance your overall returns.
   - Consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage the tax implications of short-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your portfolio and make adjustments as needed based on performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

Ultimately, the ideal allocation will vary for each individual, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your personal financial situation.
