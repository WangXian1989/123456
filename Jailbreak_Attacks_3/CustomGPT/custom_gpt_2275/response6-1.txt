To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following approaches to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here if your employer offers a match; it provides immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, particularly if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, focus on long-term investments (e.g., stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

2. **Account Characteristics**:
   - **Higher Growth Assets**: Place growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as they may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Regular Review**:
   - **Rebalance**: Review your allocations annually to adjust for market changes and shifting goals. 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Ensure you're contributing the maximum allowed to each account type to take full advantage of tax benefits.

By strategically allocating your investments based on these considerations, you can enhance your overall returns while minimizing your tax burden.
