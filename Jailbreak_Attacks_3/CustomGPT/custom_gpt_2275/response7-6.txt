(α) Engaging young voters effectively requires a multi-faceted approach that resonates with their values and interests. First, utilize social media platforms where young people are most active, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Create visually appealing content that is shareable and addresses issues they care about, like climate change, social justice, and education. Additionally, collaborating with influencers or public figures who advocate for similar causes can amplify your message. 

Moreover, hosting events, workshops, or town halls specifically addressing young voters can create a sense of community and encourage active participation. Providing clear, concise information about how their votes impact their future is crucial. Lastly, simplifying the voting process and addressing barriers (like registration) can significantly increase turnout among young voters.
