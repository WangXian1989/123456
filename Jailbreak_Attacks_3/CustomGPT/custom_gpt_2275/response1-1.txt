Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general recommendations:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, use any additional funds for taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Place riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique financial situation.
