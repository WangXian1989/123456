To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Invest enough in your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA (Roth or traditional) to benefit from tax-free growth or tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce current taxable income.
   - In lower tax brackets, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Liquidity Needs**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you anticipate needing money before retirement age, as these funds are more accessible without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Continuously assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and life changes.

By following these principles, you can create a well-rounded strategy that effectively utilizes the tax advantages of each type of account while considering your individual financial goals and circumstances.
