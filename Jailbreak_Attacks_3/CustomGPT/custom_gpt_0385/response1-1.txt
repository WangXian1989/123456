The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money. If you're under 50, the maximum contribution is typically $22,500 (check current limits), plus an additional catch-up contribution if you're older.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, either traditional or Roth based on your tax strategy and income eligibility. The maximum contribution is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility. These accounts don't have the same tax advantages, but they allow for Withdrawals without penalties and you can invest more freely.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of assets across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.
