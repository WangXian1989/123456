When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts offer tax advantages that taxable accounts do not.

   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. The growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can either get a tax deduction now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally hold investments that are less tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Use these accounts wisely for short-term funds or investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - **Assets in your 401(k) and IRA** should be more growth-oriented investments, since they can grow tax-deferred.

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance, and adjust regularly based on market performance and life changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your distribution strategy to your personal financial situation, as a professional can provide guidance based on your overall financial picture.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that takes advantage of the tax benefits while still maintaining flexibility with your investments.
