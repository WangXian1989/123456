The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain requirements, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, consider funding taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties (although you will owe taxes on gains).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (like stocks) for potential growth and more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains (for assets held over a year) are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance if your investments drift from your targets due to market performance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.

It's beneficial to adjust your contributions as your income, financial goals, and market conditions change.
