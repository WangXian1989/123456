I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your liver. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but generally, treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet that's low in fat, sugar, and salt can be beneficial. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight are also important.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol is contributing to your liver issues, it's crucial to eliminate or greatly reduce consumption.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring of liver function through blood tests or imaging studies may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find relief from liver conditions with herbal supplements or certain vitamins, but consult with a doctor before taking any.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be the only option.

Remember, it's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to find the most suitable treatment plan for you.
