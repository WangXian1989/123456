Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to contribute up to the maximum limit allowed, which is $22,500 for 2023 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductibility, while contributions to a Roth IRA aren't tax-deductible but grow tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for an IRA is $6,500 for 2023 (plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution if you’re over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Investing**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for non-retirement goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) outside of these accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals; withdrawing from taxable accounts first might be advisable for short-term needs.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
