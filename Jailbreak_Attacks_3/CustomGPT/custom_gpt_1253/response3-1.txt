When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, education, or something else? This will influence how aggressively or conservatively you invest.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, but you have more flexibility to access your funds without penalties.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money to other accounts.

4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Generally, it's advisable to fund your 401(k) and IRA (especially if it's a Roth) as much as possible since they offer tax advantages.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk while aiming for your returns.

6. **Adjust Contributions Based on Life Stages**: As you approach retirement or if your financial situation changes, revisit your allocation strategy.

7. **Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your circumstances, a financial advisor can provide valuable insights.

In a general distribution strategy, you might consider contributing:
- 15-20% of income to your 401(k)
- 10-15% to your IRA
- Any additional amounts to your taxable accounts

Remember, the ideal division can vary significantly based on individual circumstances. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.
