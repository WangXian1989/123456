To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your IRA and 401(k) for tax benefits. For 2023, the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older), and the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Investment Options**: Choose higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth. Allocate more stable investments (like bonds) to taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications:
   - Taxes on withdrawals from your 401(k) and traditional IRA are deferred until retirement.
   - Capital gains tax applies to taxable accounts based on how long you've held investments.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on market performance and your retirement timeline.

6. **Individual Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
