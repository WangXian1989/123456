Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, return to maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting money into a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for goals outside of retirement and offers more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts, considering time horizon and risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of the impact of taxes on withdrawal strategies. For example, funds in taxable accounts may be taxed at capital gains rates when sold, while tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.

7. **Consult a Professional:** Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

Overall, a balanced approach tailored to your financial situation is key.
