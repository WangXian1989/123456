Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax contributions lower taxable income.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, either Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax), offering tax advantages for retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without specific tax benefits, suitable for short-term goals or immediate access to funds.

### 2. Assess Contribution Limits
- Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.
- Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
- After maxing out retirement accounts, consider additional contributions to a taxable account for liquidity and investment flexibility.

### 3. Consider Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Limited options depending on your employer's plan. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
- **IRA**: More investment options, including individual stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds. More flexibility in asset allocation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments with long-term growth potential (e.g., stocks) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
- Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes.
- Use taxable accounts for investments subject to lower tax rates, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 5. Diversification and Risk Tolerance
- Balance your risk exposure across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and retirement strategies.

By following these steps and adjusting as your financial situation evolves, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
