The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Max out employer match offers, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax bracket. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions. If you anticipate a lower bracket, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Keep enough liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies.
   - **Invest for Growth:** Consider investing in ETFs or low-dividend stocks to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - **Adjust Allocations:** Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Consider the Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Investing:** Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth and use taxable accounts for short-term goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for better tax efficiency and growth potential. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
