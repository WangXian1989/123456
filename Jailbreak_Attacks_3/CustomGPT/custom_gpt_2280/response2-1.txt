Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Level:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Tax Benefits:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Back to Your 401(k)**
   - After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions. Aim for the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investment allocation based on your time horizon. Longer time frames typically allow for more risk.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - **Reassessment:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Strategy:** If possible, consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.

By using this approach, you can optimize your investments and prepare effectively for retirement.
