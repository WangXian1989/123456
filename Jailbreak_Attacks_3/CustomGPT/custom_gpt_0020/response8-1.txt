To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out according to your budget and retirement goals.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also provide tax deductions. If you qualify for Roth IRAs, consider them for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you need access to funds without penalties. This can also be a place for investment diversification.

4. **Diversify Investments**: In each account, ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Generally, aim for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your intended risk levels across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax burdens, considering the rules for each type of account.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
