The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they allow easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) to balance risk.
   - **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
