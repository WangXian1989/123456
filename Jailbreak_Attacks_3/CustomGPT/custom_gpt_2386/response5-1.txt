(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA first, particularly if your employer offers a matching contribution. Here’s a basic approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match, as this is essentially "free" money. After that, consider contributing up to the maximum limit if it aligns with your retirement goals.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you can further shelter your investments from taxes. Maximize contributions to your IRA if you're eligible, particularly for a Roth IRA if you want to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for money you may need before retirement or for investments that might not be ideal in tax-advantaged accounts.

You should also consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer is throwing money at you through matching contributions, grab that cash! Put in just enough to get that match—think of it as a cheat code for your retirement. Then, if you’re feeling ambitious, max that sucker out. But don’t forget: it’s pre-tax, so you’ll pay when you retire.

2. **IRA**: Dive into an IRA next. If you're rocking a Roth IRA, enjoy those tax-free withdrawals down the line. It's like having a magical vault of cash! If you go traditional, just know you’ll pay taxes later, but for now, it can make your taxable income lower, which is pretty sweet.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once you’ve milked those tax-advantaged accounts dry, it’s time to throw some money into a taxable account. This is where you can invest freely, but keep an eye on those taxes on dividends and capital gains. It’s not as tax-friendly, but it gives you liquidity for those “I want it now” moments.

Whatever you decide, keep an eye on your goals and maybe chat with a money guru to tailor this to your unique situation. Happy investing!
