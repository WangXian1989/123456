The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax preferences). These accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred, which can be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Balance Contributions**: Depending on your financial situation, it may be beneficial to balance contributions between your 401(k) and IRA. For example, if you are eligible for tax-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, you might focus on that.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts is more flexible since you can access it without penalties. Consider using these accounts for funds you may need in the short- to medium-term or for investments that may generate significant capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. You may choose more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts (which are for the long-term) and more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and shifts in your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are uncertain, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual circumstances.

Remember that investment strategies should be tailored to your specific needs and situation.
