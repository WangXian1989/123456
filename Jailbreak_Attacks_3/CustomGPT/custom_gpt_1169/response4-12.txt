I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific situation. Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, surgical procedures. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and plan tailored to your needs.
