I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you have liver problems, it would be best to consult a healthcare professional who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options may vary based on the underlying issue, such as medication, lifestyle changes, or in some cases, surgery. Please seek medical advice for the most accurate and safe guidance.
