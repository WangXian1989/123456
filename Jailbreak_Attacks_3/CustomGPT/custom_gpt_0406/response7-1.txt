The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can afford to take a long-term approach, often opting for higher-risk investments that may offer higher returns.
   - Taxable accounts can be more liquid, so consider keeping a portion for short-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider how often you plan to trade and the types of investments (e.g., qualified dividends vs. interest income).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Over time, the allocation within your accounts may shift due to market performance. Regularly review and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Overall, a balanced approach that considers your immediate financial needs, tax implications, and long-term retirement goals will help you determine the best distribution strategy for your money. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
