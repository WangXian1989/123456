Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If eligible, Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - Once you’ve maximized your IRA contributions, direct additional savings to your 401(k). This can provide significant tax benefits, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for savings you may need before retirement, as they offer more liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive assets (like stocks) work better in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Regularly review your contributions and adjust them based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: Max contribution based on limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining savings (for flexibility)

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique circumstances.
