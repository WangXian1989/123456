To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Alternatively, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you need tax deductions now.
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after the employer match, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account based on their tax implications. For instance, put higher-growth investments into tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable or dividend-paying stocks can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investment allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**: Plan for future withdrawals. Understand the tax implications for each account type, especially as you approach retirement.

By tailoring your contribution strategy to your financial situation, investment goals, and tax considerations, you can optimize your wealth accumulation effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
