Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before significantly investing.

### 3. **Contribute to IRAs**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 4. **Fill Up the 401(k) Contribution Limits**
   - After maximizing contributions to your IRA accounts, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This can be a good place for holdings you plan to sell or access before retirement.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and returns. This may include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Summary
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then ongoing contributions.
- **IRA:** Contribute to both Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for liquidity and lower-tax investments.
