Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Benefit:** Free money from your employer.
   - **Action:** Contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Benefit:** Tax advantages (traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth; Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Action:** For 2024, consider maxing out your Roth/Traditional IRA contributions (up to $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. **Fund Your 401(k)**
   - **Benefit:** Higher contribution limits (up to $22,500, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **Action:** After IRA contributions, direct additional funds to your 401(k).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Benefit:** Flexibility to access funds without penalties.
   - **Action:** Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Action:** If you’re in a higher bracket now, favor tax-deferred accounts. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth account might be better.

### 6. **Diversification Across Investments**
   - **Action:** Ensure diverse asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance in all accounts.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - **Benefit:** Adapting to life changes (income changes, market conditions).
   - **Action:** Set a schedule (annually or biannually) to review and adjust your allocations.

This approach provides a balance of immediate tax benefits, long-term growth potential, and accessibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
