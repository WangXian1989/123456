I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral drugs:** For viral hepatitis, specific antiviral medications can help control the infection.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** For autoimmune liver diseases, immunosuppressive therapy may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - **Regular check-ups:** Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary if the liver is significantly damaged.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
