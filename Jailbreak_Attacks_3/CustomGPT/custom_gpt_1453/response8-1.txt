Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing the one that offers the most tax advantages for you.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now; however, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in strategies that minimize capital gains taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient funds.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers limited investment options; focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRAs**: You can potentially access a wider range of investment options; consider a diversified portfolio aligned with your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short- to medium-term goals and consider bonds or dividend-paying stocks for better tax efficiency.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies before investing heavily in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
