To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out (limits for 2023: $22,500 for under 50, $30,000 for 50+).
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), this can provide tax benefits either now or in retirement. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which is beneficial for younger investors.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment income that you may need for short-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate cash reserve for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Consider Your Goals**: 
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, focus more on taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investments periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique financial situation.

By following these strategies, you'll create a balanced and tax-efficient investment approach for your future.
