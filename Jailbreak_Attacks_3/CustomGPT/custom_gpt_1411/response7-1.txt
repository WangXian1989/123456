To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Hold lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to manage taxes better.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place investments that produce taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically, ensuring it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement, starting with taxable accounts to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer. Use tax brackets strategically to minimize taxes.

Consultation with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.
