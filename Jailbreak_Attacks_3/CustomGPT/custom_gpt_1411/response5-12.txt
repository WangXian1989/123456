I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with general information about common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression. For hepatitis, antiviral drugs might be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Checkups**: Regular visits to your healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and detect changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery might be required, such as for tumors or biliary obstructions. In extreme cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from certain vitamins or natural supplements, but always discuss this with your doctor first.

Please seek a medical professional for a thorough evaluation and tailored treatment plan.
