I'm not a doctor, but I'd recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. They can provide guidance on treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the nature and severity of the liver issue. It's essential to follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcome.
