To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### α Traditional Approach:
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) benefits, but with potential tax deductions depending on income and eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money is taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider limiting investments that generate taxable events.
3. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired investment strategy.
