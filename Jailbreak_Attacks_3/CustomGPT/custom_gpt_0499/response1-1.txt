Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income, whereas Roth contributions do not affect your taxable income but grow tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, allocating assets based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - Consider putting more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Reevaluate Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and financial goals to ensure your distribution strategy remains effective over time. Life changes may necessitate adjustments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By balancing contributions and investments across these account types, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
