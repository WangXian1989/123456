To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Utilize tax-advantaged growth. Choose between Roth (after-tax contributions) or traditional (pre-tax contributions) based on your current and expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term savings or if you anticipate needing liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance; riskier assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify across asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risk.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first before investing in taxable accounts, ensuring compliance with IRS limits on contributions.

By following these strategies, youâ€™ll enhance your growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
