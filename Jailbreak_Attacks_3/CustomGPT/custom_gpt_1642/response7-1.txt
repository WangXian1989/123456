Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Next, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if you're able. This benefits from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are good for short-term goals or for investments that generate capital gains, since long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you diversify your investments to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed depending on market conditions and your changing goals.

Tailoring this strategy to your specific situation, including age, income, and retirement goals, is essential. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
