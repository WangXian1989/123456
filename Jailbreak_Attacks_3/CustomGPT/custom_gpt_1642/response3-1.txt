Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively hinges on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if eligible. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you're in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds that aren't required for immediate goals or don’t fit into retirement accounts can go into a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility but is subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Investment Goals and Timeline**: Think about when you'll need access to your funds. Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: At least once a year, reassess your investment allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
