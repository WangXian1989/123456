Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Start by fully funding your 401(k) up to any employer match. This is essentially free money. Then, contribute to your IRA, choosing between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Diversify Investments:** Within these accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

3. **Taxable Accounts as a Supplement:** Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability on capital gains.

4. **Review Regularly:** Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions as your financial situation and goals change.

### Key considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency:** Use tax-efficient investment strategies for your taxable accounts.
- **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals:** Align account contributions with your investment horizon.
