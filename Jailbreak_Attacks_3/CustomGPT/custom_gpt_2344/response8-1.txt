Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your income, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the present.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but check income limits for deductions.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These donâ€™t have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility, including the ability to withdraw funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure that you maintain an adequate emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to avoid early withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to defer taxes.
   - Consider more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** In taxable accounts, place investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Regular Contributions:** Automate contributions to each account to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging over time.

7. **Reassess Periodically:** Rebalance your portfolio regularly and adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
