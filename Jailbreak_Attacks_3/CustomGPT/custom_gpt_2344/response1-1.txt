Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves balancing your investment goals, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have additional funds after your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for goals that require liquidity (like buying a house or early retirement). They’re also useful for investments that generate minimal taxable income, such as index funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy. Stocks can be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns and capital gains, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts since their income is taxed at regular income rates.

5. **Revisit Annually**: Your situation might change over time, so review your investments and adjust your allocations as needed.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
