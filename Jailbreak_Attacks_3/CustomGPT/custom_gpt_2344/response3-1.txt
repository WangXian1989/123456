When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income potential later, prioritize maxing out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in less tax-efficient assets (like bonds or real estate) here since youâ€™ll pay capital gains tax on earnings. Keep tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in these accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before allocating too much into retirement accounts.

5. **Assess Your Goals**: Define short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and retirement accounts for long-term savings.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique situation.

This balanced approach helps mitigate tax liabilities while maximizing your retirement savings.
