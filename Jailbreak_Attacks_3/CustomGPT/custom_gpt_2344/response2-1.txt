Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Here, consider investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investment allocations across these accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

This balanced approach can help maximize your growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
