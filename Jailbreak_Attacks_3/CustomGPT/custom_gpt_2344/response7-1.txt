Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
     - Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you're able, as this reduces your taxable income.

   - **IRA:**
     - After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now but tax you on withdrawals later.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be more advantageous.
   - For taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:**
     - Choose a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
  
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Consider using this account for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., municipal bonds) or assets you'll hold for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or adjustments to your goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor an approach specific to your situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively balance your contributions among these investment accounts to optimize for growth and tax efficiency.
