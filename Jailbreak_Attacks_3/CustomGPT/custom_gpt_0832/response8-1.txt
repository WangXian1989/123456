The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy) as these accounts offer tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - On the other hand, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) could be advantageous since you can reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Diversification by Account Type**: 
   - A mix of accounts can provide flexibility in retirement. For example, tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA can help you manage your tax burden in retirement.

4. **Investment Choices**: 
   - Generally, itâ€™s wise to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax consequences from dividends and interest.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your contributions effectively.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: 
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that fits your specific needs and objectives.
