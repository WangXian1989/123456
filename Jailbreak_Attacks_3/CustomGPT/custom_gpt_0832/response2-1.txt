The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k) and IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, while taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold for a profit. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, it may be beneficial to focus on Roth accounts.

4. **Balance Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) match and prioritized your IRA contributions, you can go back to your 401(k) to continue contributions up to the maximum limit allowed ($22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After contributing to your retirement accounts, if you have excess funds, consider investing in taxable accounts for more immediate access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Diversity in Investment Options**: Diversify your investments within each type of account. Consider a balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy tailored to your specific circumstances.
