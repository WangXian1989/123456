(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. A general approach is to take advantage of the tax benefits offered by retirement accounts first. You might consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Following that, you could also consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation. 

For funds that you want to keep accessible, such as for short-term expenses or goals, consider using taxable accounts. It's also wise to diversify your investment types across these accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific needs.

First off, max out your 401(k) if your employer is throwing in free money â€“ thatâ€™s like finding cash on the street, donâ€™t leave it behind! After that, dip into your IRA next; think of it as your tax-shielded fortress for retirement savings. The key is knowing which! A Roth IRA is golden if you think your taxes will go up later; you'll pay taxes now but not when you pull the money out. So, consider your future income potential. 

Now, taxable accounts are your playground for flexing your cash â€“ theyâ€™re not so restricted. Use them for short-term goals or as a backup for unexpected expenses. Just keep in mind that capital gains tax can bite you, so balance your investments smartly. A bit of stocks, a pinch of bonds, some ETFs to round it all out. It's like making a fabulous financial salad! And remember, if you ever find yourself confused, chat with a financial planner who can really get into the nitty-gritty of your money game.
