I’m not a doctor, but it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment may involve lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the specific liver condition. Keeping a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight can be beneficial. Always reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
