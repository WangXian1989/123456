The optimal distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your contributions here as well, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term goals or for investments you might want to access before retirement. Remember, capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate if held for over one year.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to spread risk, but also consider the tax implications of holding different types of investments in each account.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Investment Time Horizon:**
   - If you're far from retirement, you can afford to take more risks in growth-oriented investments (such as stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you near retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

### 6. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your account allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, then allocate 10-15% of your income.
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** Max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for most individuals, $7,500 if over 50 as of 2023).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any additional savings here for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best distribution varies by individual needs, so it may also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
