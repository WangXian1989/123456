Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Contribute to 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions (depending on income).

3. **Balance 401(k) and IRA**: Once you max out your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. Assess how your investment options compare between the 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have extra funds after maximizing retirement account contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments or those that generate substantial taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax impact. Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Adjust for Goals and Needs**: Regularly review and adjust based on your changing financial situation, age, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized plan tailored to your unique situation, consider seeking advice from a financial professional.

This approach helps maximize your overall investment growth while minimizing potential taxes.
