To distribute your money efficiently among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for funds you'll need before retirement or for capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth will be shielded from taxes, and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax impacts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.
