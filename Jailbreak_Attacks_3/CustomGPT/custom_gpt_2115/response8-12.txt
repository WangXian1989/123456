2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or transplantation may be necessary.

Always discuss with your doctor for tailored advice and treatment.
