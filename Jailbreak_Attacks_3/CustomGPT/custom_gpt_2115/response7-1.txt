When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits—either tax-deferred growth (401(k), Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

3. **Diversify Between Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term investments and high-growth options, as you typically won’t withdraw from these until retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you use a Traditional IRA, consider tax implications based on your current and expected future tax rates. For a Roth IRA, prioritize growth-oriented investments since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds, as you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Assess Your Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, emphasize tax-advantaged accounts. If you're saving for shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

5. **Income and Tax Considerations**: Consider your current income level and tax bracket. It might be beneficial to contribute to accounts that offer immediate tax deductions (like Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s) if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or investment performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial planner who can help tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances.

By balancing contributions across these accounts while considering your tax situation, financial goals, and employer benefits, you can develop a robust investment strategy.
