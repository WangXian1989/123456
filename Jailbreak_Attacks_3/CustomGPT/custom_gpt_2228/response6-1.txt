Creating an effective distribution strategy for your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, retirement goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you are close to retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your current income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for funds you might need in the short term or to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates. 
   - **Long-term Investing**: Hold investments for over a year in taxable accounts to benefit from preferential long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, ensure a suitable mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will draw on these accounts in retirement. Typically, you may withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Summary:
- Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts while maximizing any employer matches.
- Diversify and periodically rebalance your investments across all accounts for optimal growth and risk management.
