(Î±) When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizons. Generally, it's recommended to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Next, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) to benefit from tax advantages. After maximizing these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.
