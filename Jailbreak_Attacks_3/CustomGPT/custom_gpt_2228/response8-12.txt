I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, limiting alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications could also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and follow your healthcare provider's guidance.
