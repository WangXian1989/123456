Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). If possible, contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **Investment Choices:** Look at investment options available in your plan. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** 
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs generally offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for money you might need access to before retirement. This includes savings for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize capital gains distributions.
   - **Long-Term Strategy:** Consider using these accounts for investments with a longer time horizon that could provide favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to gain any employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if you qualify) after maxing out your 401(k).
- **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings or investments that require liquidity or for specific short-term goals.

It's also wise to reassess your allocations regularly and adjust based on your financial situation and changing investment goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
