Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit:** In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (for those under 50) and $30,000 (for those 50 and older).
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the available investment options; ensure they align with your risk profile and investment strategy.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible; however, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2024.
   - **Diversification:** Use the IRA for investments that could appreciate significantly but also for tax considerations.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investments for Flexibility:** Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties. They're ideal for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate favorable long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there’s an employer match, and then consider your IRA contributions.
- **Diversify Across Accounts:** Keep a balanced approach among different accounts to manage tax implications and withdrawal strategies in retirement.
- **Adjust Based on Goals:** Reassess and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, tax situation, and retirement goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For personalized guidance, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help create a tailored strategy based on your unique situation.

By following a strategic approach that focuses on your individual goals and tax implications, you can maximize your retirement savings across these different account types.
