Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get your employer’s full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking full advantage of the employer match, focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation).

3. **Assess Tax Impact**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; consider this for higher income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends that can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Review your allocations at least annually and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial goals, or life circumstances.
