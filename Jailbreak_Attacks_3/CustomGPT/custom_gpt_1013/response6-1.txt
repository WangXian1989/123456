To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
- **Retirement Timeline**: Determine when you plan to retire and how that affects your contributions.
- **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type.

### 2. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 3. Consider Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options; choose low-cost index funds if available.
- **IRA**: Offers flexibility; consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, or ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- **Annual Review**: Reevaluate your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Adjust Contributions**: Shift how much you contribute to each account type based on your changing goals and tax situation.

### Conclusion
A diversified strategy that maximizes tax-advantaged accounts while using taxable accounts for flexibility can help optimize your overall returns. Adjust your approach based on your life stage, financial goals, and market conditions.
