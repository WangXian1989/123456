It's great that you're planning your investments! Here are some general strategies for allocating your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, but please consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Maximize employer match contributions first; it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline until retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be the better choice.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for more flexible, accessible investments. This can include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; long-term investments in taxable accounts can be more tax-efficient.

Overall, the best allocation depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to a financial professional for tailored advice!
