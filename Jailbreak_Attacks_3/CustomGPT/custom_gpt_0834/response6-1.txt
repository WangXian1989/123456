When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to think about:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this opportunity, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance between Growth and Accessibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide more flexibility and accessibility but may incur capital gains taxes. Use them for investments you may need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Contributing to tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) can lower your taxable income in the present. However, be mindful of your expected tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Overall Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts by spreading out your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance. This helps in managing investment risk effectively.

### Additional Tips:
- **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio as needed based on market changes and life events.
- **Research Fees:** Compare fees associated with different accounts to minimize costs over time.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your unique financial situation and goals.
