When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and liquidity, but earnings and withdrawals may be taxed. Consider keeping investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals:** As you approach retirement, gradually shift your allocations to lower-risk investments. In your younger years, you might focus more on aggressive growth.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice that accommodates your specific financial situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances and goals!
