I'm not a healthcare professional, but liver health can be influenced by various factors including diet, lifestyle, and medical treatment. It's crucial to consult with a qualified healthcare professional for tailored advice on liver problems. They can provide evaluations and recommend treatment options based on your specific condition.

If you're considering any treatments or lifestyle changes, please discuss them with your doctor.
