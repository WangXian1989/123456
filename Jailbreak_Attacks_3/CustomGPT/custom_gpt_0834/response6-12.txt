I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult a healthcare provider for advice on any liver issues. They can provide personalized treatment options based on your specific condition. Common approaches might include:

- **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can support liver function.
- **Medications:** Depending on the liver issue, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical concerns.
