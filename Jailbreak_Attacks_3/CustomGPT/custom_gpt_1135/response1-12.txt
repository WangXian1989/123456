I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options can vary widely based on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, antivirals for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms might be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to assess liver function and disease progression.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or liver transplants may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and a proper diagnosis.
