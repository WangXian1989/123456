To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Great for expecting higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Used for investments with fewer tax benefits. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (Retirement)**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out employer matches in your 401(k) first.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset classes that perform well in your time horizon and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your target mix.

### Example Strategy
1. **Max out your 401(k) contributions** (especially if there's an employer match).
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** if eligible, focusing on tax-free growth.
3. **Use taxable accounts** for additional savings or investments not suitable for retirement accounts.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider discussing with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your financial situation and goals.
