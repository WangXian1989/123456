To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax benefits. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options, consider taxable accounts for their liquidity and investment flexibility. Use these for short-term needs or if you want to invest in assets not available in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and timeline. Generally:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds).
   - Consider higher growth or income-producing assets in tax-advantaged accounts where you wonâ€™t be taxed until withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
