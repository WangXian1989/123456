To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2024, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (plus $1,000 for those 50 and older).

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider fully funding your IRA (Roth or traditional based on your income and tax situation).
   - If you can, then continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate income or capital gains frequently, such as stocks that pay dividends or bonds.
   - Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices reflect a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, maintain an emergency fund in a savings account that covers 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your investments and adjust your allocation based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.
