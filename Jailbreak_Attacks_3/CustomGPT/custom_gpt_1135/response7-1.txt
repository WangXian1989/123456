Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your income allows, consider maxing out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like Roth IRAs) for tax-free growth.
   - If you're in a lower bracket now, traditional accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) may be beneficial.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter them from higher tax rates.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically. Typically, tap taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer, unless you are facing penalties or specific tax situations.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Keep an eye on asset allocation across all accounts. Periodically rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice from a financial professional can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the full company match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use leftover funds for investments, prioritizing tax-efficient options.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax scenario, and regularly assess your investment strategy to ensure alignment with your goals.
