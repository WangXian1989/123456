Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions first, especially if you receive a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This is useful if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks and mutual funds) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your overall portfolio regularly. Adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal circumstances.
