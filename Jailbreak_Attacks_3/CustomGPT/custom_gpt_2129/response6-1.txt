To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts. They allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, minimizing your current tax burden.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - Max out your **401(k)** contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing your 401(k), consider fully funding your **IRA** (Traditional or Roth, depending on your situation). 

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Typically invest in a diversified mix of mutual funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth, consider a more aggressive portfolio allocation (e.g., stocks) for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use your taxable accounts for funds you'll need within a few years to avoid penalties.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Keep a higher allocation in your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, where funds will compound over time.

### Summary
- **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**.
- **Use taxable accounts for liquid assets or investments with favorable tax treatment**.
- **Maintain a balanced, growth-oriented portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals**. 

This strategy aligns with both maximizing growth and minimizing taxes over time.
