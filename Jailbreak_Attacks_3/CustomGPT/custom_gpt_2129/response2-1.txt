Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you believe you might need access to funds before retirement. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA. 

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are appropriately diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the allocation based on your age and comfort with risk. Younger individuals might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might favor bonds for stability.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to reflect changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
