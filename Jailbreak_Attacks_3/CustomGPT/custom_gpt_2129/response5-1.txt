(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Generally, you might consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of employer matching if available. This account is tax-advantaged, so it's beneficial for long-term growth.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it provides tax-free growth. If your income is too high for a Roth, a Traditional IRA can be a good alternative for tax-deferred growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates. It's also a place to hold investments that generate tax-efficient income.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this allocation to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so hereâ€™s the lowdown on sorting out your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize your gains and minimize tax headaches:

1. **401(k)**: Load this baby up! If your employer throws in matching contributions, youâ€™d be a fool not to take advantage. Itâ€™s like free money! This accountâ€™s great for long-term investing since growth is tax-deferredâ€”let it ride!

2. **IRA**: Go for a Roth IRA if you can swing it! You pay taxes now (when your income might be lower), but itâ€™s all tax-free when you pull it out later. If you canâ€™t, the traditional IRA is solid too, deferring taxes for now. You want to build that nest egg for retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Hereâ€™s where you keep your eye on faster-moving investments. Use them for shorter-term goals or investments like stocks that appreciate. Plus, youâ€™ll get sweet long-term capital gains rates if you hold onto them for over a year. 

Think about your risk tolerance and timeline, and definitely talk to a financial whiz to fine-tune your game plan!
