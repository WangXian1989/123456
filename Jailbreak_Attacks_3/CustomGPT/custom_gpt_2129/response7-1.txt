To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching; contributions are pre-tax (reducing your taxable income).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but investments can be more flexible.

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. This helps grow your investments tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial long-term. For higher brackets, consider traditional IRAs or 401(k)s.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a diverse portfolio across all accounts, aligning asset allocation with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on market performance and changes in your goals or risk tolerance.

7. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts may have penalties if withdrawn early.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

By strategically allocating your contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
