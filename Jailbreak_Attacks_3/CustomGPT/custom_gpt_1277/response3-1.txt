To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar benefits to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but you can also access funds without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term needs (taxable accounts for liquidity) versus long-term growth (401(k) and IRA for retirement).

3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match; this is essentially free money.
   - Take advantage of IRA contribution limits next, particularly if you can open a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, such as prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) first.

As you assess these factors, a good rule of thumb could be:
- Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions after that.
- Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts as needed for liquidity and diversification.
