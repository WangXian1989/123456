I canâ€™t provide specific financial advice or investment strategies. However, I can direct you towards general principles related to retirement planning and investment distribution, which could help you in discussing this with a financial advisor. It's typically recommended to consider factors like your risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax implications when deciding how to allocate funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. If you're looking for design thinking methods related to financial planning processes, I can help with that!
