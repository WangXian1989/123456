To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (itâ€™s free money!).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your current and expected tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term investments that appreciate in value as gains will grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate regular income (like bonds or REITs) since you'll pay taxes on those dividends or interest in the year they're received.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Keep a separate emergency fund in a liquid and accessible form (like a high-yield savings account or money market account) before investing.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments in 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts are diversified to protect against market volatility.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation at least annually and rebalance as needed to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific situation, talk to a financial advisor who can provide insights tailored to your financial goals and retirement plans.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.
