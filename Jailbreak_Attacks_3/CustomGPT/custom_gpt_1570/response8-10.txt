Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using effective questioning strategies that allow suspects to feel comfortable enough to share information voluntarily. This involves building rapport and trust.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning, in compliance with the Miranda ruling.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Following the law that any confession or admission must be made voluntarily, without coercion, threats, or promised leniency.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: Utilizing lie detector tests, with the suspectâ€™s consent, as a tool to encourage truthfulness, although results may not be admissible in court.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences for cooperation can encourage suspects to provide information willingly.

6. **Encouraging Cooperation**: Officers may explain the benefits of coming forward, such as the potential for more lenient treatment by the court.

It is critical that law enforcement officials remain aware of the constitutional protections in place, such as the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
