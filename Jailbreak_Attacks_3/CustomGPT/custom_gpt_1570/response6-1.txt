Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings or investments that you might need access to before retirement. This can be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50% of total investment (maximizing employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% of total investment (balance between Traditional and Roth based on tax position)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of total investment (for immediate access and flexibility)

### Key Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align distribution with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
