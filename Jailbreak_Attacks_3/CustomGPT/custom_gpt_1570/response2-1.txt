Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. IRAs generally offer tax benefits that can be beneficial in the long run.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you are in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be appealing since you pay taxes on the contributions now and withdraw tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher bracket later, a traditional IRA or 401(k) could provide more immediate tax savings.

4. **Diversify Withdrawals**: When you start withdrawing money in retirement, having a mixture of accounts can help you manage your tax liability. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes, then from tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Maintain a Balanced Portfolio**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
