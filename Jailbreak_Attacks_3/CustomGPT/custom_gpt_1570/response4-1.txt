To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following points:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer contributions: If your employer matches contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Tax advantages: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider your current vs. expected future tax bracket when deciding how much to contribute.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Types: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Your current income level and future tax expectations can influence this choice.
   - Contribution limits: Be aware of the annual contribution limits (for 2023: $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Flexibility: Taxable accounts offer greater flexibility than retirement accounts since there are no withdrawal restrictions or penalties.
   - Investment selection: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held longer than a year and interest income taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributing to accounts with the best benefits (e.g., max out 401(k) match first, then contribute to an IRA).
- Consider your own financial goals, investment time horizon, and anticipated expenses.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to minimize risk and potential tax implications.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances.
