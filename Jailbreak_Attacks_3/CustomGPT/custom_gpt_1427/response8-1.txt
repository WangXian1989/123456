Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investments. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Fully Fund an IRA**: If you are eligible, try to fully fund a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts, as these accounts typically provide tax benefits that can enhance growth.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be useful for short-term goals, as the funds can be accessed without penalties. However, capital gains taxes might apply to investments held in these accounts, especially if sold for profit.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Rebalancing can help you maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary depending on your specific circumstances, goals, and preferences. Always consider the impact of taxes and penalties on withdrawals, especially when planning for retirement.
