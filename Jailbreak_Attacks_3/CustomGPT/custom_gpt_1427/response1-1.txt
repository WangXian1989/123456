Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to help guide you:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. 
   - A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, aim to maximize contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but may be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure to diversify your investment across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and goals. 

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

It's important to align your investment strategy with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Always keep an eye on the tax implications when deciding how to allocate your investments.
