When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your contributions to traditional or Roth IRA accounts, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, as they offer tax deferment or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement, as they donâ€™t have withdrawal penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider more aggressive investments for long-term growth due to tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments to avoid high capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, goals, and changing tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs and goals.
