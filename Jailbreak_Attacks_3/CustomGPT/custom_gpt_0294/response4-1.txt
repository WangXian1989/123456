To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. Best for short-term needs or to hold assets not suited for retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) to tailor your investment strategy.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you maximize contributions up to the limits for each account to benefit from tax advantages.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which have restrictions.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually 3-6%).
2. **Fund IRA**: Consider contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use after you've covered 401(k) and IRA contributions, focusing on investments that minimize taxes (like index funds).

4. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of your total investment contributions.
- **IRA**: 10-15%.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds.
