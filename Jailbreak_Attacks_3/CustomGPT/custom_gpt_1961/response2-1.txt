Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Prioritize maximizing any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute enough to reach the match and consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can afford it. This offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - A Traditional IRA is beneficial if you want a tax deduction now, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for flexibility and liquidity. These accounts are good for goals that are less than five years away or for retirement savings over the contribution limits of IRAs.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-term goals**: Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Medium-term goals**: Mix IRA contributions with taxable accounts.
- **Long-term goals**: Maximize 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions.

### Considerations:
- Assess your current and expected future tax bracket.
- Consider your income needs in retirement.
- Review investment options within each account for growth potential versus risk tolerance.
- Regularly re-evaluate your strategy as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
