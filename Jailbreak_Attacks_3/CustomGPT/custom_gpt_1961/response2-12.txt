I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options. Liver problems can vary widely in nature and severity. Common treatment options may include dietary changes, medications, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgical interventions or procedures. Always follow a medical professionalâ€™s advice for your specific condition.
