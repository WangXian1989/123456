(🔒Normal Output) The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial, as they allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred. For instance, contributing enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match is often advisable, as this is essentially “free money.” After maximizing the match, you may want to consider contributing to an IRA, which can also offer significant tax benefits. Once you have adequately funded your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can be directed towards taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.
