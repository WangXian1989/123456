When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to evaluate several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options within each account. 

A 401(k) plan typically offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you do not pay taxes on your earnings until you withdraw the funds, usually during retirement. Additionally, many employers provide matching contributions, which can significantly enhance your retirement savings. Prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the match is often advisable, as it represents free money that can accelerate your financial growth.

An IRA, whether traditional or Roth, also presents tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional IRA can be tax-deductible, thereby reducing your taxable income for the year. Conversely, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, providing significant long-term benefits. Depending on your current tax situation and anticipated future income during retirement, you may want to decide between contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.

Taxable accounts, while not providing tax advantages, offer flexibility. You have the ability to withdraw funds without penalty, and you can strategically manage capital gains and losses. This could be a useful tool for short- to medium-term goals or to cover unexpected expenses without penalty.

In summary, a balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions and benefits across all three accounts. By doing this, you can enjoy the tax deferred and tax-free benefits of retirement accounts while maintaining liquidity and flexibility in your taxable accounts.
