I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but generally, the treatment options for liver issues depend on the underlying cause. Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol, are often recommended. Medications may be prescribed to manage specific conditions like hepatitis. In severe cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplantation may be necessary. Always seek guidance from your doctor for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
