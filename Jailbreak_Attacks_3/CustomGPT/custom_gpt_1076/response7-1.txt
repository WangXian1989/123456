Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and current tax situation. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider aiming for the annual contribution limit ($19,500 for individuals under 50 or $26,000 for those 50 and older for 2021).
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. The annual contribution limit is $6,000 for individuals under 50 and $7,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement. 
   - Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Consider spreading contributions between Roth and Traditional based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable investment accounts. This is particularly useful for investing money you might need before retirement since there are no penalties for early withdrawals in taxable accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing actively in these accounts. Opt for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Diversify across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and account contributions. Adjust according to any changes in financial circumstances, goals, or market conditions.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
