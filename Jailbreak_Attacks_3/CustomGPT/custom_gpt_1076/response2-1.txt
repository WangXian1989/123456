Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the unique characteristics, benefits, and tax implications of each account type. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), with potential tax-deductible contributions depending on income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can be taxed on dividends and capital gains, so they may not be the best choice for long-term growth if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure to diversify across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, keep an emergency fund in a savings account or low-risk investment, covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age and risk tolerance should dictate how aggressively you invest. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk while older investors may prefer safer, income-generating assets.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Keep contributing regularly to all accounts, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging, which can help mitigate market volatility.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Assess your investment performance and asset allocation at least annually to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider talking to a financial advisor who can personalize advice based on your financial situation.

By following these guidelines and regularly assessing your financial health, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these account types.
