Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a good employer match, prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation and eligibility.
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for savings goals that are shorter-term and for additional retirement savings beyond the limits of 401(k) and IRA contributions.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax situation when making decisions about where to allocate your investments. Roth accounts can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Before making decisions, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
