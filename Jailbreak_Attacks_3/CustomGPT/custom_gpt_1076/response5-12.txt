I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some general treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adjusting your diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat infections, reduce inflammation, or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and liver function tests may be necessary to monitor your condition.

4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgery may be required to remove tumors or damaged portions of the liver.

5. **Transplant:** For end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation.
