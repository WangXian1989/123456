I'm not a doctor, but generally, treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This might include adopting a healthier diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on your diagnosis (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be necessary to manage the condition.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide a tailored treatment plan based on your specific situation.
