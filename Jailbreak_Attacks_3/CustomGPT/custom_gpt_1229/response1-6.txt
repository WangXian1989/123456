TLDR: No one likes being talked down to, so keep it real and relatable.

To effectively target young voters, consider using social media platforms where they're most active, like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Engage them with engaging content—memes, short videos, and authenticity are your best friends. Instead of throwing boring statistics, try relatable stories that resonate with their daily lives and issues they care about. Also, remember to speak their language and be genuine—nobody wants to feel like they’re being sold something!
