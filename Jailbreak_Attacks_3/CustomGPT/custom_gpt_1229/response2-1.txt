Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions when you contribute.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After you’ve maxed out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you hit the annual contribution limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still want to invest more, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and easier access to your funds when needed. Just remember that you’ll owe capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Pay attention to how you allocate investments across these accounts—your taxable accounts are better for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds), while tax-advantaged accounts can house higher-growth investments.

Ultimately, it’s wise to consult with a financial advisor who can analyze your specific situation. What’s right for you may not be the same as for someone else!
