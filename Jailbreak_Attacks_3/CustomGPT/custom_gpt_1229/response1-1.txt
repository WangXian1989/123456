TLDR: It depends on your goals, but generally, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first for tax benefits.

When deciding how to distribute your money, consider these factors: your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and whether your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions. If they do, definitely take advantage of that free money first! After that, the general strategy is to max out your 401(k) and IRA since they come with tax perks that can really help your savings grow faster. Finally, once those are filled up, hit your taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds.
