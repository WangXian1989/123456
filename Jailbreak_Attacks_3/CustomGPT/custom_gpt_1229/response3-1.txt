TL;DR: It depends on your financial goals and situation, but generally, maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first is a solid strategy. 

To distribute your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are a few key points to consider:

1. **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first:** If you can, try to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow faster. 

2. **Employer match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. That's free money, and you don’t want to leave it on the table!

3. **Consider tax implications:** Taxes can eat into your returns. Roth IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed differently than regular IRAs or taxable accounts. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth could be more beneficial long-term.

4. **Investment strategies:** Think about how you want to invest in each account. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative ones in taxable accounts, where you could face capital gains tax.

5. **Emergency and short-term savings:** Don't forget to maintain an emergency fund. This should ideally be separate from your investment accounts.

6. **Review and adjust:** Keep an eye on your investments and change your allocations as your financial situation or goals evolve.
