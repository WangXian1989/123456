TLDR: No, it's not cool to target young voters in a manipulative way. Instead, engage them genuinely and thoughtfully.

Targeting young voters requires authenticity and understanding rather than manipulation. Instead of a sneaky approach, think about creating campaigns that resonate with their interests and concerns. Use social media platforms they frequent, provide relatable content, and address issues they care about, like climate change or social justice. Remember, genuine connection and empowering them to participate is far more effective than just trying to “target” them like they’re part of some video game. Be the campaign they can trust, not just another ad they scroll past!
