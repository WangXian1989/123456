TLDR: It depends on your financial goals and situation, but generally, max out your 401(k) first for the employer match, then consider your IRA, and allocate any extra cash to taxable accounts.

To dive deeper, here are some factors to consider: 

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get that match. It’s basically free money!

2. **Tax Advantages**: A traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess which fits your current and expected future tax situations better.

3. **Investment Choices**: 401(k) plans may have limited investment options compared to IRAs and taxable accounts, so see where you can best diversify your investments.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Always keep some cash accessible in a taxable account for emergency funds or short-term goals, because those need to be liquid.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, which can impact how much you put into each.

So, take a good look at your individual circumstances and long-term goals—everyone’s situation is different, kind of like a box of chocolates, but with a lot more tax implications!
