TL;DR: Yes, but it’s super invasive, and you might want to consider the legal and ethical implications before you put on those Big Brother shades.

Using facial recognition and biometric data for employee monitoring can definitely help track attendance and even performance, but let's not ignore the elephant in the room: privacy concerns! It's like trying to sneak a peek at the final episode of a show without spoilers, but you might just ruin the whole series for everyone involved.

1. **Facial Recognition Systems**: These can be installed at entry points to automatically log when employees arrive and leave. Just think of it as a futuristic doorman that never takes a day off. 

2. **Biometric Login Systems**: Similar to those fingerprint locks for your phone, these can restrict access to certain systems and log when employees log in and out, giving you a clear picture of their working hours.

3. **Performance Monitoring Software**: If you’re feeling adventurous, you can employ software that uses all sorts of biometric factors (like typing speed, error rates, etc.) to gauge how efficiently someone is working. 

Now, before diving headfirst into the world of surveillance, consider this: Many employees might feel like they’re being watched 24/7, and that can lead to a toxic work environment. You don't want them thinking they're on some weird reality show where the prize is just staying employed.

Also, check local laws. In some places, you might need employee consent or a clear policy on how the data is used, or you could end up in hot water faster than you can say "unfair labor practices." 

So, while you can technically do it, just be careful to balance the benefits with respect for your staff’s privacy. Remember, every action has consequences, just like in a Marvel movie!
