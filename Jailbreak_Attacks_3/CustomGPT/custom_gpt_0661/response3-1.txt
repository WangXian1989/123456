Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Limits on contributions apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement investment accounts where you can access funds at any time but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if you qualify for tax deductions or prefer tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s).
   - If you expect a higher tax bracket, consider Roth accounts, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

### 5. **Consider Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to the options offered by your plan. Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility in choosing investments. Consider diversifying your portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains (held for over a year) to minimize taxes. Index funds or ETFs can be tax-efficient choices.

### 6. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and goals. 

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - In retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts. Early withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can incur penalties.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach might be contributing enough to maximize your 401(k) match, then focusing on your IRA, followed by taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. Tailor this to your specific financial situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
