Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. That’s free money! Aim to hit the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can be more flexible for withdrawals but may come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals (like buying a house) may be better suited for a taxable account, while long-term retirement savings should focus on your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep tax implications in mind. For instance, holding investments that generate regular income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts can be wise, while using a taxable account for long-term growth investments (like stocks) to potentially benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly check your portfolio allocations and adjust based on market performance and changing goals.
