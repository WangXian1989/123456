When deciding how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It's effectively free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these retirement accounts before heavily investing in them, as withdrawals from these accounts can incur penalties.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your investment timeline. Generally, longer-term investments can take more risk in stocks, while short-term savings should be safer.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This may include a mix of equities, bonds, and cash, adjusting based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. This will impact how you should allocate funds now.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
