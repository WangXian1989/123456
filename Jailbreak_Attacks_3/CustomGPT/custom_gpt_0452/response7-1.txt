Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here incur capital gains taxes on profits when sold, making them suitable for short-term needs or assets expected to appreciate significantly.

### 3. **Choose Investments Wisely**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically, choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that align with your financial goals and consider tax-efficient options (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically 3-6 months of expenses, before aggressively investing in long-term accounts.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

By following these principles, you can make informed decisions on how to distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
