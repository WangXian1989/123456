When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the approach depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic overview:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxable upon withdrawal. Use this for long-term growth.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) with potentially more investment options. Also, it’s tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Profits are taxed as capital gains. Consider using this for investments you might need to access before retirement or to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Time Horizon**: If your goal is long-term (like retirement), you might invest more heavily in growth assets within a 401(k) or IRAs.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Markets fluctuate, and your allocation may drift over time. Regular rebalancing ensures you maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Withdrawals and Contributions Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need in the short term or for tax efficiency.

In summary, start by maximizing your employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to IRAs (considering a Roth if suitable), and finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term goals. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your changing financial situation and goals. 

For personal strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your specific needs.
