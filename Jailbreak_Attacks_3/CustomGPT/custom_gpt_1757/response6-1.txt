To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. If possible, aim to maximize contributions (up to the limit).
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing it out for tax-free growth. For traditional IRAs, assess your current and future tax brackets to decide on contributions. 

2. **Balance Between Accounts Based on Goals:**
   - For retirement savings, prioritize the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth given their tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term savings or investments where you may need quicker access to funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Investment Strategies:**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments in the 401(k) and IRA, where gains can grow tax-deferred. Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, and keep interest-bearing or dividend-paying investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor the performance and adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, life circumstances, and market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

By strategically allocating funds and regularly reviewing your progress, you can optimize your total investment growth while effectively managing your tax liabilities.
