Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, maximize this benefit first. Contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional IRA and 401(k) may lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Roth accounts do not reduce your current taxable income but allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Consider using your taxable accounts for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income, like bonds or REITs, while keeping growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your investment performance and reassess your allocations periodically. As you approach retirement, you may want to shift to a more conservative allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and better prepare for retirement.
