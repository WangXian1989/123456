Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):**
     - Tax-deferred growth; contributions reduce taxable income.
     - Often includes employer matching contributions.

   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Can be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
     - Individual contribution limits.

   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No tax advantages; flexible withdrawals.
     - Subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Strategic Allocation**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
     - Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match as it’s free money.
     - Consider maxing out contributions once you have established an emergency fund.

   - **Prioritize IRA Contributions:**
     - After 401(k) contributions, fund an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you expect your tax rate to increase.
     - Take advantage of tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
     - Invest in funds with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Hold investments that produce tax-favored income (e.g., qualified dividends, long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Bracket Considerations:**
     - Lower your taxable income by prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) when in a higher tax bracket.
     - Shift to Roth IRAs or taxable accounts when in a lower tax bracket.

   - **Withdrawal Strategy:**
     - Plan withdrawals strategically; consider the tax implications of taking funds from different accounts (like potentially keeping your tax bracket stable).

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - **Annual Review:**
     - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
   - **Adjust Contributions:**
     - Adjust your contributions to optimize tax benefits, especially before major life changes (retirement, buying a home).

### General Rule of Thumb:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have at least 3-6 months of expenses saved before maxing out retirement accounts.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type to minimize risk.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can maximize growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
