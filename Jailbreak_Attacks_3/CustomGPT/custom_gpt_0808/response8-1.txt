Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions (depending on income), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your match, continue contributing to your 401(k). Depending on your plan, you may have pre-tax or Roth options.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility. This can include stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. Keep in mind that taxes on dividends and capital gains will apply here.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can take more risks (higher equity exposure), while those nearing retirement may prefer a more conservative portfolio.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution and investment strategy periodically (at least annually). Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws may require adjustments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice catered to your specific circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This balanced approach is beneficial for growing your retirement savings while managing tax efficiency.
