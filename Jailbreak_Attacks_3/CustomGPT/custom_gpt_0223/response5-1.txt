Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s may reduce your current taxable income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to mitigate risk. Each account type can hold various assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Define your retirement timeline. For long-term goals, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then add to taxable accounts based on liquidity needs.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.

By focusing on these areas, you can create a balanced portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
