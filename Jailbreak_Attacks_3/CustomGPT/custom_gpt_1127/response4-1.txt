To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Make the most of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Use a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation.
   - **Consider Eligibility**: Make sure to check income limits for Roth contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Invest in taxable accounts for money you'll need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Utilize strategies like holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Overall Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Prioritize having 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.
- **Retirement Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
- **Diversity Across Accounts**: Consider holding different types of investments in each account to optimize tax efficiency.
