Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### General Guidelines

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Take advantage of tax deferral on contributions and earnings.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider contributing to both Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) IRAs.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Supplemental Savings**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility and needs not covered by retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavy investing.
2. **401(k)**: Contribute until you get the full employer match, then consider:
   - Maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible.
3. **IRA**:
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect your income to be higher in retirement.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, invest excess funds in taxable accounts for liquidity and additional growth.

### Allocate Based on Goals

- **Aggressive Growth**: More funds in stocks within tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Income Generation**: Focus on bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be strategic about withdrawals and capital gains to minimize tax impact.

It’s beneficial to periodically reassess your allocation based on changing circumstances, market conditions, and tax laws. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
