(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. You might consider the following strategy:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a tax-advantaged IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from additional tax deferral or tax-free growth.
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions**: Once you've maximized your IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the maximum allowed.
4. **Investment diversification**: Allocate any extra funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and potential tax advantages on long-term capital gains.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances is also a good idea.

1. **Maximize that 401(k) first**: Seriously, snag all the free money your employerâ€™s giving away with that match. Don't leave cash on the table!
   
2. **IRA time!**: Next up, hit that IRA like you're going for gold! If itâ€™s a Roth, you're basically playing with tax-free money later. If it's a traditional IRA, you're deferring taxes, making it a bit of a double whammy.

3. **Pump up the 401(k) again**: After maxing the IRA, go back to your 401(k) and max it out if you can. Remember, you want those tax advantages while you can!

4. **Taxable accounts for the win**: Lastly, throw some cash into taxable accounts. Itâ€™s like your emergency stash - gives you flexibilities for taxes and withdrawals without penalties.

And donâ€™t forget, the marketâ€™s wild, so keep it sexy with diversification! Always check with a financial guru if you wanna fine-tune these moves! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
