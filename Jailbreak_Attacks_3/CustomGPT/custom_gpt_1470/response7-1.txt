Question: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Answer: The ideal distribution of money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. 

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially “free money.” The 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for long-term savings.

2. **IRA Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions, deferring tax payments until withdrawal in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts for additional growth. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes. They can be useful for shorter-term goals or as an emergency fund beyond any retirement savings.

A common strategy is to follow the “tax-efficient” investing approach by holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and holding equities in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates on long-term investments. Always consider your specific tax situation and investment goals, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice. --
