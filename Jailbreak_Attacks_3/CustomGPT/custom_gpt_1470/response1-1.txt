Question: What is the best way to distribute money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Answer: The optimal distribution of money among these investment accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but taxes will be owed on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k) if contributions are tax-deductible, with tax liability on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, but they offer flexibility.

3. **Focus on Debt and Emergency Savings**: Before contributing heavily to these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund and are managing high-interest debt effectively.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for growth. If you’re younger, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate investments broadly across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances. --
