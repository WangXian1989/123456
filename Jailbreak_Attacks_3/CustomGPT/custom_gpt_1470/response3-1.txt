Question: What is the best way to distribute my money amongst my 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts?

Answer: The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-deferral**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Investment Options**: Check the available investment options and fees associated with your 401(k).

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of the eligibility income limits for Roth IRAs.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older) for IRAs, so maximize this if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity without early withdrawal penalties, which can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates on long-term capital gains. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies when applicable.

**General Strategy**:
- Aim to fund your 401(k) to capture any employer match first.
- Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your financial situation).
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

A balanced approach, taking into account tax implications and financial goals, is best. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation. --
