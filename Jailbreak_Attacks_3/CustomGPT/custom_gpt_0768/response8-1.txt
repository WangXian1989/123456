When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to focus on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible for either a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider funding this account as it often has tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now.

3. **Max Out Contributions**: If you can, maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement or for short-term goals. The flexibility can be advantageous, even if it's less tax-efficient.

5. **Investment Choices**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance in all accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts are great for long-term investments, while taxable accounts can hold more liquid, short-term investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially in taxable accounts. Holding investments for more than a year can qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an adequate emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of expenses) to avoid dipping into investments during a financial crisis.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment mix and adjust according to changes in your finances, life circumstances, and market conditions.

Ultimately, the best allocation strategy can vary greatly depending on personal circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
