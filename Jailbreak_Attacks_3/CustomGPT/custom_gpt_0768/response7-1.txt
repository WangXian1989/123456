Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if viable.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds, based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), ensure that your IRA is well-diversified. You can hold a wider array of investment options in IRAs compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable events, like high-dividend stocks or short-term trading, but also consider tax-efficient investments like index funds.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur taxes, so prioritize using taxable accounts for short-term needs while letting retirement accounts grow.
   - Look into tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts to offset capital gains.

4. **Adjust Based on Retirement Goals**: Tailor your distribution strategy based on your expected retirement age, income needs in retirement, and other personal financial goals.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to ensure that your strategy aligns with your individual circumstances and goals.
