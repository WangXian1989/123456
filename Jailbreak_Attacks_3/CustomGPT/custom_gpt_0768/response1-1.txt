The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider High-Interest Debt:** Before investing, pay off any high-interest debt (like credit cards), as the interest from that debt can outweigh potential investment gains.

3. **Fund Your IRA:** After maximizing any employer match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

4. **Balance Contributions:** Allocate remaining funds between your taxable accounts and your 401(k). The 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth, but consider your withdrawal strategy and potential tax implications in retirement.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in those accounts. Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Diversify Your Investments:** Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes, sectors, and geographies to spread risk.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so revisit your allocation regularly to adjust as needed.

It might be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.
