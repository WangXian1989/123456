To provide the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, tax situation, and the specific features of each account type. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and is critical for maximizing your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional 401(k)), reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met). Decide which type of IRA aligns best with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not receive the same tax advantages. However, they offer liquidity and flexibility, allowing you access to your money without penalties.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep more conservative investments, such as bonds or income-generating assets, in taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax impacts.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts. Diversification helps manage risk and optimize returns.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals:**
   - If you have short-term goals (e.g., buying a home), prioritize saving in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - For long-term retirement goals, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

By prioritizing where you contribute based on these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments and optimize your tax situation while working toward your financial goals.
