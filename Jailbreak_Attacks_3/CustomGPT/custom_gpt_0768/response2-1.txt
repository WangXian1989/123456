Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Prioritize Growth and Risk**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for higher-risk investments that may generate significant capital gains, as these accounts can shelter growth from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments or those that generate regular income, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, since capital gains taxes could apply when sold.

4. **Consider Withdrawals and Penalties**: 
   - Funds in a 401(k) or IRA are generally penalized if withdrawn before age 59½. Consider your withdrawal needs when determining where to allocate funds.

5. **Tax Impact**: 
   - Taxable accounts may allow for more flexibility in tax management, as you can realize losses to offset gains. Keep an eye on your capital gains tax implications and try to manage your taxable income effectively.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that fits your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocation among these accounts based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, or retirement goals.

8. **Seek Professional Guidance**: 
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual situation and long-term goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will align with your overall financial plan, taking into account your short-term needs and long-term objectives.
