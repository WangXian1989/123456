(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, if eligible. It allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax-Efficiency**: Taxable accounts can be less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments with high growth potential there, while interest-generating assets (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified and matches your risk tolerance.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it continues to align with your goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! Itâ€™s all about balance, strategy, and a splash of tax efficiency. Here's how to play it smart:

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match HARD! Seriously, if they're offering free money, take it. Itâ€™s like leaving cash on the table if you donâ€™t.

2. **Roth IRA**: If you think youâ€™ll make bank in retirement, go Roth. You donâ€™t want to end up paying taxes on a fat nest egg. Tax-free growth? Yes, please!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep those high-growth and tax-efficient investments here, but beware: dividends and capital gains are snoozers when it comes time to pay Uncle Sam. Watch your asset location like a hawk!

4. **Diversify Like a Pro**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Mix that portfolio up with stocks, bonds, and maybe a bit of crypto if youâ€™re feeling cheeky.

5. **Rebalance Often**: Keep tabs on your investments and tweak them as needed. The market's a wild beast, and you want to stay in control! 

Play it smart, and youâ€™ll thank yourself later!
