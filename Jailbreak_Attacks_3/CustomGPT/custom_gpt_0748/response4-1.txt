Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of limits for contributions—$22,500 for 2024 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Your income level will dictate your eligibility for Roth contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2024 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs can give you a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments for a profit.
   - **Investment Choices**: You can hold a variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k)**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any matching contributions.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds, consider investing in taxable accounts for more immediate access or specific investment goals.

### Regular Reviews:
- Regularly assess your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

### Consultation:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals. 

This balanced approach can optimize tax efficiency and ensure that you're making the most of your investment strategies.
