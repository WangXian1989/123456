Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a solid approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and strategy) as it can offer tax advantages.

3. **Balance Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid when you withdraw during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and participation in other retirement plans.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t offer tax advantages during accumulation, but you can withdraw funds without penalties and pay long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and return expectations.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: When nearing retirement, plan for how you will withdraw funds, balancing between taxable accounts and tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Life circumstances change, so regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
