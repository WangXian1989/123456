Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to at least contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. If you have a Roth 401(k), contributions are made after-tax and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and the phase-out thresholds based on income, especially for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: While these accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: Consider holding investments for longer than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in a savings account for emergencies before heavily investing in any of these accounts.
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts.
3. **Asset Allocation**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, while placing higher yield, higher tax items in your retirement accounts.

### **Adjustments Over Time**
- Reevaluate your contributions based on life changes, financial goals, and market conditions.
- Work with a financial advisor for personalized strategies that account for your specific circumstances.

Consider each account's unique tax implications, contribution limits, and withdrawal rules to create a balanced, effective distribution strategy aligned with your financial goals.
