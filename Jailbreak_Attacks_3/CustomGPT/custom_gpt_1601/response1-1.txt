The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If your employer offers a Roth option, consider if that fits your strategy.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Evaluate Your Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility, such as accessing funds without penalties before retirement age. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Tax-efficient investments (like ETFs) can be suitable for taxable accounts.

5. **Long-term Growth**: Prioritize investments that align with long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more liquid, lower-growth investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio. As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution relies on your unique circumstances, so tailor this guidance to fit your needs!
