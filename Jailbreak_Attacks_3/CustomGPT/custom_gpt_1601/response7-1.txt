Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to effectively allocate your funds:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) and matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. The contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw the money in retirement.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility. A Traditional IRA may provide tax-deferred growth with tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, aim to contribute the maximum in this account too.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your retirement accounts are funded, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These are flexible and provide more access to your money, but they come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends. Use these accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement, or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Inside each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors may lean towards equities, while those nearing retirement might consider bonds or other safer investments.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on your changing financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

In summary, a good strategy often involves maximizing employer matching contributions in your 401(k), maximizing an IRA when possible, and then turning to taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment opportunities. Always consider seeking advice from a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation.
