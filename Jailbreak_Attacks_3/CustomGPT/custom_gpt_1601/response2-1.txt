The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for investments and withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate account before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Long-term growth may lead you to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals might be better served by taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Donâ€™t forget to diversify your investments to spread risk across different assets.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each type of account. Maxing out a 401(k) or IRA may be limited by annual caps.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.

A common strategy might be to fully utilize the employer match in a 401(k), then contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible), and finally invest in a taxable account. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
