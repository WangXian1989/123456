To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
   - Identify short-term and long-term financial needs.

2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money that's needed before retirement, as withdrawals can be made without penalties.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diverse investment portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, but consider tax implications:
     - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
     - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Rebalancing and Contributions**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Automate contributions to ensure youâ€™re consistently investing without having to think about it.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Ideally, draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

These strategies can help optimize your investment distribution for both short-term and long-term financial success.
