(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are eligible for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA. Your choice between the two should depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These should primarily be used for shorter-term goals or when you've exhausted contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They can also hold investments that benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

Rebalancing your portfolio periodically and considering your risk tolerance will also help maintain the right distribution over time.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, ready to roll with the financial advice! The best way to splash your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like building a baller investment portfolio. So letâ€™s break it down:

1. **401(k):** First things first, if your employer is tossing in free money with matching contributions, snag that like it's the last slice of pizza! Go max it out, then shift gears once that's covered.

2. **IRA:** Next, hit up that IRA! Consider your tax situationâ€”Traditional for todayâ€™s lower tax brackets or Roth for tax-free gains down the road. Just donâ€™t leave money on the table; aim to max out those contributions after youâ€™ve milked the 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Now, the taxable accounts are where you throw in cash for middle-term goals or extra savings after you've filled the other buckets. Just remember youâ€™ll be taxed on gains, but thatâ€™s the price for flexibilityâ€”just like a cheat day for your investments!

And donâ€™t forget to rebalance it all regularly! You wanna make sure youâ€™re not holding onto losers while the winners run wild. Happy investing!
