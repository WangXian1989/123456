For effective distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: After securing the match in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (whether Roth or traditional) up to the maximum limit. This provides potential tax advantages.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is maxed out, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Adjust asset allocation based on which account the funds are in, considering tax implications.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your contributions and investment performance to stay aligned with your financial goals.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.
