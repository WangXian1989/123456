To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax but offer liquidity.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”this is free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if you qualify) next, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Finally, allocate funds to your taxable account for short-term goals or further diversification.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on any gains.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investing**:
   - Place interest-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

By diversifying your investments across these accounts and adhering to tax-efficient strategies, you can maximize your long-term gains. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
