Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like tax implications, your financial goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth accounts**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for short-term goals and investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term goals, adjusting the asset allocation accordingly.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment objectives.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
