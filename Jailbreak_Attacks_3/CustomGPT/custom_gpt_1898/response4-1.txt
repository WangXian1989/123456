To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for retirement savings. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute to an IRA next, especially if you have a Roth option, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRAs. Ensure you maximize contributions up to these limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for investing in opportunities that donâ€™t fit in retirement accounts. Consider capital gains tax implications.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes in retirement, considering the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes, and maintain an eye on both short-term and long-term financial needs.
