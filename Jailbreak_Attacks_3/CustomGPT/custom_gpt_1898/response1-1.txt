To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If you can, max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Roths offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now.
  
2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Consider holding more income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where dividends and interest can be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains and dividends in taxable accounts; minimize trading to reduce tax liability.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have liquid savings or an emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Invest for the long term in each account, and regularly review your allocation to stay aligned with your retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, speaking to a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
