The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a brief overview of how you might consider allocating your funds across these accounts:

### 1. **401(k) Plans:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider your current vs. future tax rates when deciding how much to contribute.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). If you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you stay within the annual contribution limits. If you're eligible, contribute the maximum amount for the tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but don't have tax advantages like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, which generate less taxable income. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund separate from these accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Younger investors may lean towards equities, whereas those closer to retirement might prefer safer fixed-income investments.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Example Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Focus on taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or to hold tax-efficient investments.
