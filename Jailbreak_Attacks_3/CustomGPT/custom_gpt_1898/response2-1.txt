Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k)s and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Contributions may reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts may provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. They can be good for investments you plan to access before retirement.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments**: For retirement accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) since you have time to ride out market volatility.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies. These funds should be more liquid and potentially less risky (bonds or cash equivalents).

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting the mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Each account may perform differently based on market conditions.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. 
   - **Strategize Through the Tax Zones**: Be mindful of tax brackets and aim to withdraw in a way that minimizes your overall tax burden.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best strategy involves customizing your distribution based on your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement plans. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
