Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and eligibility.

2. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both offer tax advantages. Traditional accounts provide tax deferral, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher growth/volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets (like bonds) to manage tax impact.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your retirement timeline. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts to manage taxes efficiently in retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investment performance and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help you optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals.
