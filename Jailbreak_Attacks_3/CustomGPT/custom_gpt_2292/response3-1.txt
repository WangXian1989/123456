Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA. Funds grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free if you meet the requirements.

3. **Fill Up Traditional Accounts Next**: After maxing your employer match and contributing to a Roth IRA, focus on your 401(k) or a Traditional IRA. These accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement or for investment opportunities that don't benefit from tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind, long-term capital gains are taxed lower than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth. Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Your financial situation may change, so regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

By following this framework, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial objectives while maximizing tax efficiency.
