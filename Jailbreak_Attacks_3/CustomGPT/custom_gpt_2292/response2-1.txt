Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions.

4. **Allocate Taxable Investments Wisely**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider placing bonds or high-dividend yield stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) throughout all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Periodically assess your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a professional.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can enhance growth while managing tax implications effectively.
