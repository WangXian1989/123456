To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) for additional tax benefits.

3. **Utilize Your 401(k)**: Once your IRA is maxed out, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds available after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and goals across all accounts. Generally, aim for a blend of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and consider placing lower-growth, income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
