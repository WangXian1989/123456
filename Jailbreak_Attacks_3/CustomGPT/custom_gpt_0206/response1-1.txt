To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first; contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax advantages or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing after tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for greater flexibility.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep investments that generate high income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Financial Situation**:
   - Adjust contributions based on your current income needs and financial goals.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess allocations regularly to align with changing financial circumstances and goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
