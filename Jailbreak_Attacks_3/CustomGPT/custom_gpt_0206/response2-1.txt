Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so this should be your last priority for growth-focused investments.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term Investments:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Savings:** Use taxable accounts for savings you may need sooner.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Keep different asset classes in different accounts. For example, hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes on dividends.

### 5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Use dollar-cost averaging to make regular contributions to your accounts, which can reduce market timing risks.

### 6. **Annual Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in goals, or life circumstances.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20%
- **IRA:** 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 5-10%
- Adjust based on your specific goals and contributions limits.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice, particularly regarding tax implications and investment strategy tailored to your unique circumstances.
