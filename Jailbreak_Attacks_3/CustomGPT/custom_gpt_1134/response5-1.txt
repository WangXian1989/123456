(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a good strategy is:

1. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax preferences.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings or investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. 

Balancing these accounts based on tax implications and growth potential is key. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Load this baby up firstâ€”especially if your employer matches! Itâ€™s like a bonus for contributing. You can rack up serious tax breaks here.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, think about an IRA. If you can do a Roth, go for itâ€”tax-free growth? Yes, please! If you're eyeing a traditional IRA, make sure you understand the tax impacts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, stash anything extra in taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility but watch out for those capital gains taxes creeping in. 

Mix and match based on your goals, like a financial DJ! Always keep an eye on how each account impacts your overall strategy. Cheers to smart investing! ðŸŽ‰
