Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible), as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax-deferred growth, a Traditional IRA is a good option.

3. **Prioritize 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for long-term capital gains strategies. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies here.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts. Taxable accounts have different tax treatments, especially for capital gains.

7. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and investment strategy as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
