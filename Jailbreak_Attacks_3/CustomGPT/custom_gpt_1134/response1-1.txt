To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income, prioritize your 401(k) for its tax benefits and possible matching contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them attractive if you believe your tax rate will be higher later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can go in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are tax-free or tax-deferred, while more stable investments can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications in taxable accounts. Use tax-efficient funds and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.
