The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize the employer match first. Consider contributing more based on your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional growth. This can be beneficial for emergency funds or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider asset location strategies, keeping more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation, contributions, and investment performance. Adjust based on changing financial circumstances and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
