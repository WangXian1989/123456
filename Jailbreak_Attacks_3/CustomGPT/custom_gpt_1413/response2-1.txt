To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRAs for Tax Advantages**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investment flexibility. These can provide easier access to funds if needed before retirement.

4. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of mutual funds or ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Take advantage of a wider range of investment options. Consider index funds or target-date funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Distributing your investments based on their tax implications can enhance overall returns. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals, as individual circumstances can vary widely.

By following these approaches, you can leverage the advantages of each account type for optimized growth and tax efficiency.
