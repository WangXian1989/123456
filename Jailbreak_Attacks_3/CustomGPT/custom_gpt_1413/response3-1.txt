Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and current financial status. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: Pay off any high-interest debts before heavily investing.

3. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

4. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to your limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations based on changing tax laws, your income situation, and financial goals.
