Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth contributions (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free growth.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial for deferring taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) to avoid hefty tax bills.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks held long-term (to benefit from capital gains taxes).

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before investing larger sums in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your investment allocations periodically to align with your goals and market changes.

**Consult a Financial Advisor:** For a tailored strategy considering your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor is highly recommended.
