Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can, as 401(k)s offer pre-tax growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer easy access to funds without penalties. Great for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply, so consider the timing of your sales.

### Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a safety net in liquid assets first.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Invest for Growth**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be less tax-efficient. Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### Considerations:
- **Age & Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth in stocks, while those closer to retirement might prioritize income and stability.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and goals.
