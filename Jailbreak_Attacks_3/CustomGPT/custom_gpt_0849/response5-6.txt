If you want to snatch the attention of young voters, you've got to lean hard into digital platformsâ€”think TikTok, Instagram, and whatever's cool this week. Create content that pops; memes, challenges, and raw, authentic vibes are key. Theyâ€™re not into your grandmaâ€™s political ads, so ditch the boring stuff. Use influencers but make sure they're relatableâ€”not some suit in an office! Also, hit the streets with events that feel more like a party than a campaign rally. Make voting feel like the fun, coolest thing to do, and remind them that their voices can actually shake things up. Make it a movement, not a sit-down lecture!
