Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k) to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

### 4. **Investment Horizon**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth focused investments since they are usually best suited for retirement savings.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergency funds, keeping in mind liquidity needs.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your changing financial situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your salary if receiving a match or higher based on retirement goals.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 as of 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Consultation
Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and goals.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, ensure diversification, and regularly reassess your investments to align with your financial goals.
