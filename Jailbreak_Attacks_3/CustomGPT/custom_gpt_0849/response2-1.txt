Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Max out contributions to these accounts since they offer tax benefits. For 2024, the contribution limit is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus catch-up contributions for those 50 and older).
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and may be more advantageous for long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile investments (like equities) that benefit from tax deferral.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they'll be taxed at a lower rate when held long-term.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on market performance, changes in income, and your retirement timeline.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
