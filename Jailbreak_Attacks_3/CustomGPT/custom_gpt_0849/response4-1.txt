Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA Accounts**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. IRAs often offer more investment options and tax benefits. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous because withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, shift your focus back to your 401(k), particularly if you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Monitor and Adjust**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
