Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible, as these accounts offer tax advantages. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**:
   - Consider putting more high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments likely to generate income or short-term capital gains, such as bonds or real estate, which are taxed at higher rates.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect your income to rise significantly in the future, prioritize tax-deferred accounts now to lower your taxable income.
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket, it might be advantageous to prioritize Roth accounts (if applicable) to pay taxes now at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and growth-focused assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider meeting with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific goals and circumstances.

This framework should help you create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
