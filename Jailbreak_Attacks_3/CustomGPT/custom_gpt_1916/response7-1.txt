Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Consider your future tax situation when choosing between them.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your regular income rate, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Taxable accounts are more flexible regarding withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) outside of these accounts before aggressively investing.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - If retirement is your main goal, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - For short-term goals (like buying a house), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure a balanced allocation among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your goals.
