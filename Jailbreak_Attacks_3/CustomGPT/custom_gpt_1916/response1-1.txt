To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Invest in a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, prioritize contributions that align with your tax strategy. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate excess funds here for flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) while using taxable accounts for income-generating investments that may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before maxing out retirement accounts. This provides liquidity and financial security.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.

Every individual's situation is different, so adapt these suggestions as necessary to fit your long-term financial strategy.
