The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth), which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Regular IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings and dividends are taxed in the year they're received. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Intermediate to long-term goals can focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account and allocate funds accordingly.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure youâ€™re spreading your investments across different asset classes. This might mean holding different funds in each account to manage risk.

6. **Withdrawal Plans**: Consider how and when you plan to access the funds. Taxable accounts allow for easier access, while 401(k)s and IRAs may have penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more you might want to shift towards less volatile investments.

**General Strategy**:
- Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get employer matching.
- Contribute to your IRA (prioritize Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).
- Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and to maintain liquidity for short-term goals.
