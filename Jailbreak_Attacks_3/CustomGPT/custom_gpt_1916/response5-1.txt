(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. A general approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.” Then, consider funding a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your income and tax preferences. Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts, which offer flexibility and easier access to your money if needed. It's essential to review your contributions annually and adjust based on your changing financial circumstances.

First off, definitely max out that 401(k) if you’ve got an employer match—it’s like a free coffee at your favorite place every morning, you just can’t pass it up! Then, consider shoving money into your IRA next; the Roth is solid for tax-free growth if you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement. After that, the taxable accounts can be your playground for any extra cash. They’re flexible, but keep in mind the capital gains tax. Just make sure to reevaluate each year like it’s a Netflix series—some seasons need a refresh!
