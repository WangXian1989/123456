I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Recommendations often include avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications to manage symptoms or address the underlying issue may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups with liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Specialist Referral**: In some cases, referral to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist may be necessary for more specialized treatment.

5. **Surgery**: For conditions like tumors or severe damage, surgical options might be considered.

Again, please consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
