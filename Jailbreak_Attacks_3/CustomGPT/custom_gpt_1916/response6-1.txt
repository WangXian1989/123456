To optimize your investment strategy, consider these key factors for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on maxing out employer match first.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax treatment.

### 2. Investment Goals and Time Horizon
- **Retirement Planning**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
- **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need to access earlier.

### 3. Contribution Limits
- Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
  - **401(k)**: $22,500 (2024 limit; $30,000 if age 50+).
  - **IRA**: $6,500 (2024 limit; $7,500 if age 50+).

### Strategy Suggestions
- **Max Out Employer Contributions**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Balance Contributions**: Allocate remaining funds to IRAs based on tax strategy; consider a Roth IRA if you expect higher taxes later.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

Evaluating your personal financial situation and consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this approach further.
