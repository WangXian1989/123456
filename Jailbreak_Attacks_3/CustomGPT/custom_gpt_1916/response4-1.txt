Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** Traditional IRAs may allow for tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay tax on withdrawals. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider these accounts for short-term goals or investments in assets that generate capital gains.

3. **Investment Goals:** 
   - Long-term savings may benefit from tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) first, since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - For medium to short-term goals, taxable accounts may be more suitable for liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified to manage risk and meet your overall investment strategy.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocation as market conditions and your financial situation change.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea to personalize your strategy based on your specific situation.
