Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match amount. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions. It's often tax-advantaged and offers a wider range of investment options.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment opportunities. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals and can be beneficial for mid-term goals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to mitigate risk and maximize growth potential. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Balancing these elements can help optimize your overall investment strategy.
