Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several key factors:

1. **Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matching. The limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+) to a traditional or Roth IRA. Prioritize the type based on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement (ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits on contributions, but you have flexibility and can access funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings in a liquid, accessible account for emergencies before maximizing retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk, keeping your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) suitable for your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust contributions based on how close you are to retirement. Younger investors may favor higher-risk investments, while those closer to retirement may shift towards stability.

6. **Investment Fees and Choices**: Check the fees associated with each account. Low-cost index funds or ETFs are often recommended for minimizing costs.

### Typical Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax benefits.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA, return to the 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, contribute to taxable accounts for flexibility or specific savings goals.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes. Adjust for investment performance and personal goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
