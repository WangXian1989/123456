When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Once you max out your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Good for long-term growth, as you defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Ideal for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term savings or investments that may generate taxable income.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts where funds can grow without immediate taxation.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep cash or short-term investments in taxable accounts for accessibility.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Equity vs. Fixed Income:** Place high-growth investments (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Bonds:** Consider holding fixed-income investments in taxable accounts, as they can trigger annual tax liabilities.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts to help balance risk and enhance returns, taking advantage of different tax treatments.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your allocations to align with changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment goals.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize both growth potential and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
