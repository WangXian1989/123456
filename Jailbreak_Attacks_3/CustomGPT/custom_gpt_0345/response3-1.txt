Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to mitigate taxes.
   - Keep stocks and long-term growth investments in your taxable account for favorable capital gains treatment.

### 4. **Build Up the 401(k)**
   - After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Debt Management**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily. Also, prioritize paying down high-interest debt, as it can offset investment gains.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while considering your individual circumstances will yield the best results. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your needs.
