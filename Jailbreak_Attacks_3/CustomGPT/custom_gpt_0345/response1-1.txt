Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a few key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred contributions; employer match may be available.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred, with contributions that may be tax-deductible (depends on income).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on gains; more flexible for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. This can be beneficial for your financial situation when youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantage accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to defer taxes. Keep more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Gradual Contributions:**
   - If you can, max out your IRA contribution limits after your 401(k) employer match. Consider the tax impact of withdrawing funds when planning for early retirement or major expenses.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly, so getting personalized advice can help you make the best decision.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach usually involves starting with the employer match in your 401(k), then looking at maximizing IRA contributions, and finally using taxable accounts for additional savings or investment flexibility.
