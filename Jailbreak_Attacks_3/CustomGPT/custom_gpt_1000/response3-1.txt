Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds available after your IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This may help reduce your taxable income if you’re contributing to a traditional 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility and access to funds without the penalties associated with early withdrawal from retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, investment income in taxable accounts is generally subject to capital gains tax, whereas qualified withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs have different tax treatments.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary over time.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
