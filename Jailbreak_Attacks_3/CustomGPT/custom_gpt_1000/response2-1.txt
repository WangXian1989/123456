To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match if available. This is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget permits.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. If you qualify, max out your IRA contributions.

2. **Debt Considerations:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to prioritize paying that off before making significant contributions.

3. **Investment Options:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offer a limited selection of investment options. Choose funds that have low fees and a good historical performance aligning with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** You have a broader selection of investments. Choose a mix that complements your 401(k) investments to diversify your portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for more accessible funds. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market changes.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

6. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Assess your financial goals, such as retirement age or purchasing a home, and adjust contributions accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.

This approach aims to maximize tax advantages while maintaining flexibility and a balanced investment strategy.
