1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; limit processed foods, sugar, and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease may be prescribed.
  
3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - Regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging studies to monitor liver function and assess damage.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins:**
   - Completely avoid alcohol and be cautious with medications and supplements that can affect liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
