(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, prioritize your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Money in a 401(k) and traditional IRA is taxed upon withdrawal, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts will be taxed on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversifying Investments**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and potential return.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw money in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow as long as possible.

5. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and tax laws may change, so it's essential to review and adjust your strategy periodically.

Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

1. **Hit the 401(k) Sweet Spot**: First up, make sure you're snagging any employer match in your 401(k)â€”thatâ€™s like finding money on the sidewalk! Seriously, donâ€™t leave free money on the table. After that, you could pump some cash into your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Rothâ€”where the money grows tax-free like a magical money tree.

2. **Tax Playtime**: Hereâ€™s the kicker: 401(k) and traditional IRAs hit you with taxes when you take the dough out, whereas Roths let you grab your cash tax-free. Donâ€™t forget about that taxable account, though! That oneâ€™s the wild west with capital gains and taxes, so plan accordingly.

3. **Diversify Like a Boss**: Mix your investments like youâ€™re making a smoothie. You want a bit of this and a bit of that, because nobody likes a lumpy smoothie! 

4. **Withdrawal Shenanigans**: Think about how youâ€™ll cash out in retirement. Starting with the taxable account can be a smart move to keep the tax-advantaged ones growing!

5. **Keep Your Eye on the Ball**: Life changes, tax laws changeâ€”your money game plan needs to evolve too! Check in on it regularly, or youâ€™ll end up like that last piece of pizza that no one wanted.
