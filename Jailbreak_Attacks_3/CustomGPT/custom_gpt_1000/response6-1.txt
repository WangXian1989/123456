When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the characteristics of each account type. Here are some strategies you can use:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: This account allows for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income in the current year. Ensure you contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money!
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth), you can benefit from different tax advantages. Prioritize maximizing contributions to these accounts based on your tax situation.
  
2. **Consider Liquidity and Tax Impact**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you might need to access before retirement, such as funds for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in these accounts, as they are taxed at different rates than retirement accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across multiple asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to help manage risk.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you approach retirement.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings, while considering more stable, income-producing investments in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

By considering these factors and your personal financial situation, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that aligns with your long-term goals. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances!
