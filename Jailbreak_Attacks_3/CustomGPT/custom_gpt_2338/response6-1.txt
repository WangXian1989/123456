Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy based on tax implications and growth potential. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Tax Advantages
- **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. If you want immediate tax deductions, go for a traditional IRA.
- **401(k)**: Use traditional contributions for tax deferral.

### 3. Assess Investment Options
- **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices; choose lower-cost index funds if available.
- **IRA**: Typically offers a broader range of investment options.

### 4. Taxable Accounts
- Use these for investments that generate capital gains. Consider investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax treatment.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Contribute to the 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Max out your IRA** contributions (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation).
3. **Invest surplus funds** in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Final Thoughts
- Regularly review your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
