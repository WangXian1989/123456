Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches and tax-deferred growth. Aim for at least enough to get the full match if available.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out any 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond retirement accounts. This could be for goals like a home purchase or early retirement. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies here, such as focusing on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses in a separate account.

### Overall Strategy
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** initially (401(k) and IRA).
- **Balance based on goals**: Adjust contributions based on short-term versus long-term goals.
- **Diversify investments** across accounts to optimize for tax implications.

### Monitoring and Adjusting
- Regularly review your portfolio and adjust as needed based on performance, market changes, and your personal financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs and goals.
