Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After securing the match, prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
     - **401(k)**: Offers higher contribution limits.
     - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket, traditional accounts can provide immediate tax benefits. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you will withdraw from these accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**
   - If you need liquidity or are saving for short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

### 5. **Diversify Investments Based on Account Type**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Consider placing bonds and higher-yield investments here to reduce tax burdens on income.
   - **Roth IRA**: This is ideal for higher-growth investments, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 6. **Review & Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
A well-balanced approach usually involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first and then utilizing taxable accounts for additional savings. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
