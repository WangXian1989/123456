When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide tax-deferred growth. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if over 50).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRAs**: If you're eligible, choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax), based on your expected retirement tax bracket.
   - **Tax Bracket Awareness**: If you anticipate being in a higher bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth options might be beneficial.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Choose investments that align with your long-term goals, typically more growth-oriented (stocks).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and to take advantage of market conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy to optimize tax implicationsâ€”traditionally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help manage taxes.

This approach can help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
