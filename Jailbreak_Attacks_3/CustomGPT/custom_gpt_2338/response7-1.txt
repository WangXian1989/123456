Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowed if possible. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Similar investment strategy as your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for short-term goals or to keep a reserve of cash. Investments in index funds and ETFs can be tax-efficient.
   - **Capital Gains Considerations**: Be mindful of when you sell investments, as short-term gains can be taxed at a higher rate.

### Strategy Summary:
1. Prioritize your 401(k) contributions up to the match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions next.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings and flexible access.

### Regular Review:
- Rebalance your portfolio annually based on market performance and life changes. 

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation or goals change!
