Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Consider taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (considered "free money").
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand how withdrawals are taxed from each account type.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar diversification; consider adding alternative investments if allowed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., ETFs, index funds).

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-inefficient assets** (like bonds) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - **Tax-efficient assets** (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Assess your portfolio at least annually and adjust based on performance and changes in financial situation or goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can offer personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 20-30% (maximize employer match and tax-deferred growth)
- **IRA**: 20-30% (maximize annual contributions)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40-60% (for flexibility and liquidity)

This distribution can vary. Adjust based on your unique circumstances and objectives.
