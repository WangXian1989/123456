Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any company match (free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals**  
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Ideal for high-growth investments that will compound tax-free until withdrawal.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**  
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider broader investment options like ETFs and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexible allocations including real estate or stock trading.

### Example Allocation Strategy  
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (especially if there's a match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 annually, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining savings for flexibility.

### Regular Reviews  
- Reassess annually to adapt to changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency and access to funds when needed.
