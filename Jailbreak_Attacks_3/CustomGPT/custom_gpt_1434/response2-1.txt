Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the limit to take advantage of tax deferrals.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses in liquid cash or a high-yield savings account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like dividends or short-term gains. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts.
