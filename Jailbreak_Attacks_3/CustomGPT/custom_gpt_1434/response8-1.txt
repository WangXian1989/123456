Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider funding a Roth IRA or traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs after addressing employer matching. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement contributions, allocate funds to a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals and diversifying your investments.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Plan for tax efficiency. Generally, hold investments that generate interest in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds in your IRA) and growth stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you are well-diversified across asset classes, regardless of account type. Adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Don't forget to maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

8. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investments and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
