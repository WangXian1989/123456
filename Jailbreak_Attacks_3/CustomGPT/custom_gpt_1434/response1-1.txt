When distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max out Contributions**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to the employer match to maximize free money. Then, contribute to your IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. It's ideal for higher earners.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or accessing funds without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Balance investments based on your age, risk tolerance, and when you plan to use the money. Younger investors might prefer growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a varied mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation and goals.
