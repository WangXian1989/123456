To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
- **Contribute to an IRA** next (Roth or Traditional), depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional accounts provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. Diversify Investments
- **401(k):** Invest in a mix of index funds, target-date funds, or other low-cost options. Choose a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance.
- **IRA:** Use this for investments that may be less suitable for a taxable account, like REITs or certain bonds, which can generate taxable income.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider using these for any short-term savings goals since they allow for more flexibility.

### 3. Assess Your Time Horizon
- If saving for retirement, focus more on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts. 
- For short-term goals, prioritize liquidity in your taxable accounts.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- Personalized advice can help you tailor your strategy based on your financial goals and situation.

Following these steps can optimize your investment strategy across the various accounts and maximize your financial growth over time.
