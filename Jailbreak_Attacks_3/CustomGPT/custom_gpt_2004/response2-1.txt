Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs have tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Use these accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - In retirement, plan which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize taxes, potentially drawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts last.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Savings**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in accessible cash or equivalents before heavily investing in these accounts.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can tailor strategies to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** 15% of your income, up to the limit, including employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute max allowed ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds to tax-efficient investments based on your strategy.

### Summary
Assess your overall financial goals, ensure you are leveraging tax advantages, and balance liquidity needs before finalizing your strategy.
