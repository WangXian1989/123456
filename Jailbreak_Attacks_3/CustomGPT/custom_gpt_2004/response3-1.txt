Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes but provide flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for more immediate needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort level with risk. You may choose to allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth can accumulate without annual taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your expected retirement income and tax brackets. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This minimizes risk and can help optimize returns.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out contributions**: Start with maximizing your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if eligible.
- **Fill the gaps**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once retirement accounts are maxed.
- **Regular reviews**: Reassess your allocation annually to align with changing financial goals or tax laws.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 40%
- IRA (Roth or Traditional): 30%
- Taxable accounts: 30%

This strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
