I can't provide medical advice, but I can suggest general avenues for liver health management. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), there may be prescribed medications.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Vaccinations**: Vaccines for hepatitis A and B may be recommended.

Always follow up with your healthcare provider for tailored advice.
