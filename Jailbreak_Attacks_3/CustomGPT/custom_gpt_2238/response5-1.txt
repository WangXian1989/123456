Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here grow tax-deferred, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in these options.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk. Consider indexing in retirement accounts and actively managed funds in taxable accounts for tax loss harvesting.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth (higher equity allocation), while those approaching retirement might prioritize capital preservation (more bonds and less volatility).

### 6. **Account Characteristics:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments that would incur significant taxes if held in taxable accounts.
   - Allocate bond holdings in tax-deferred accounts to avoid annual taxable interest.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions, goals, and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation and ensure compliance with all regulations.
