When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate each account's specific benefits and tax implications. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax which lowers your taxable income. Focus on maxing this out first, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions that grow tax-deferred.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Distribute Based on Goals**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Aim to contribute significantly to these for long-term growth and tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They can be useful for short- to medium-term goals, providing liquidity without early withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Consider Investment Selection**
   - Choose investments favorably suited to each account type. For instance, consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while using taxable accounts for more stable dividend-paying stocks, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - **Rebalance** your portfolio and contributions annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the employer match, then max it out if you can.
- **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions (consider switching between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investment, prioritizing flexibility.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
