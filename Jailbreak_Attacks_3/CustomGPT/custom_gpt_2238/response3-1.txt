Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
- **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Higher contribution limits than IRAs.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Taxation depends on your income level and withdrawal strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are accessible anytime but subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Fund an IRA**: If you can, fully fund your IRA, particularly a Roth if you qualify, for tax-free growth.
- **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **Contribute to Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for additional investments or short-term goals after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Diversification:
- Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 4. Consider Tax Efficiency:
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in 401(k) and IRAs to defer taxes on growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) here for potential tax benefits due to lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 5. Regular Review and Rebalance:
- Annually review your portfolio allocation and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), fully fund your IRA, and then contribute to your 401(k) again before investing in taxable accounts. Maintain a diversified, tax-efficient investment strategy and review regularly.
