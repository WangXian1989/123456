To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for 50 and older as of 2023). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs to lock in lower tax rates now.
   - For lower income years, contribute to a Traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexible Investing**
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify within each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts, as they can grow without immediate tax liabilities.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation annually to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions between these accounts helps optimize tax situations and ensures you have liquidity options. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
