Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contribution, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you have a high income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains, like stocks or funds, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Keep an eye on your tax situation. It may be beneficial to fill up lower tax brackets with income from taxable accounts or Roth distributions.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns across all accounts for optimal risk and return.

7. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Additional Points
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts for liquidity.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust contributions based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

### Questions to Consider
- What are your specific financial goals (retirement age, lifestyle)?
- Are you currently in a particular tax bracket that might influence your decisions?
- Do you have other investment accounts or assets to consider? 

This approach ensures you maximize growth while considering tax efficiency and liquidity needs.
