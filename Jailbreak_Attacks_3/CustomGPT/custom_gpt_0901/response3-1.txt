Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute beyond the match if you can, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These can offer flexibility, as you can access the funds without penalties.

5. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might opt for more aggressive investments.

6. **Yearly Review**: Regularly review your distribution strategy, adjusting as your financial situation, tax laws, and personal goals evolve.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary (up to company match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if possible (e.g., $6,500 annually).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds after maxing out above accounts.

Keeping these considerations in mind will help you create a balanced, effective strategy for distributing your money across these accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
