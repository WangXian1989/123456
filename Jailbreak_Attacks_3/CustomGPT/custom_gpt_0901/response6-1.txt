Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here should be for shorter-term goals or additional flexibility, as they don't have the same tax advantages. Consider keeping investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher tax-burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Adjust Based on Goals and Time Horizon**  
   - **Retirement Focus**: If retirement is your main goal, prioritize maxing out tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For goals within the next 5–10 years, focus more on taxable accounts for better liquidity.

### Summary  
- **Prioritize** tax-advantaged contributions: max out 401(k) and IRA.
- **Use taxable accounts** for flexibility and lower turnover investments.
