Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the benefits and limitations of each type of account. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get the Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on your investment.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement (including earnings) are tax-free.
   - If you're eligible, consider maxing out your contributions to a Roth IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest for Shorter Time Horizons**: Taxable accounts are suitable for goals that are closer in time (like buying a house). They provide more liquidity and fewer restrictions.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use this account for long-term investments that generate lower capital gains (like index funds) or tax-efficient income (like municipal bonds).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, a mix of equities, bonds, and cash is advisable.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - **Adjust Contributions as Needed**: Life circumstances and financial goals change. Review your allocations regularly and adjust based on your savings goals, age, and investment performance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Aim for the maximum match and contribute 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining savings, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### Conclusion
A diversified strategy that maximizes tax advantages while ensuring liquidity for shorter-term needs can effectively prepare you for retirement. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
