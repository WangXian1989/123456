To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth; often includes employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA:** Provides tax advantages, with a choice between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. If you're eligible and it's beneficial, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket:**
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - In lower brackets, consider Roth contributions for long-term tax benefits.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate a mix of equities and bonds across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Think about your expected withdrawal needs in retirement. Taxable accounts provide liquidity, while tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize taxes in retirement.

### 7. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate excess funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax implications. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
