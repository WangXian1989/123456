It's important to tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation and goals. Here are some general guidelines to help you distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so it may be wise to keep investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) here.

3. **Diversification:** Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. The specific allocation depends on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors typically have a higher risk tolerance and may favor more aggressive investments in their 401(k) or IRA, while older investors may prefer safer investments as they approach retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your unique financial situation for personalized investment strategies.

Make sure to review the fees associated with each account type as well, as they can impact your overall returns.
