When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach typically depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money." After that, consider your contribution limits (for 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). In 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals. In contrast, Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to allocate your investments.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Taxable accounts are less restrictive in terms of withdrawals than retirement accounts, making them useful for financial goals that arise before retirement. Use these accounts for short- to medium-term goals, while keeping your longer-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Invest According to Time Horizon:**
   - The further away you are from retirement, the more aggressive you can be with investments (i.e., a higher percentage in stocks). As you near retirement, you may want to adjust your asset allocation to reduce risk.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance your accounts as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will be tailored to your unique financial situation. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations.
