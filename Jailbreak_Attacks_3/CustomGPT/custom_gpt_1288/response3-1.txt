When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach you might find useful:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your retirement needs and time frame.
   - Consider short-term needs versus long-term growth.

2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, but may come with limited investment options and potential for higher fees.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages (traditional IRAs are tax-deferred while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement), more flexibility in investment choices compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provide liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Suitable for short-term savings or investments.

3. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions. Depending on your income, you might be eligible for a Roth IRA, providing tax-free growth and withdrawals.

5. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Consider the IRS contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (plus an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 for catch-up contributions).

6. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement when making decisions.

8. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

By taking these steps, you can develop a strategy that optimizes the advantages of each account type, ultimately working toward your retirement readiness and financial wellness. If you're uncertain, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
