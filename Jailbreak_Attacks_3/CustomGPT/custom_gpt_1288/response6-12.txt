I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and common treatment options. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. 

Here are some common treatment options that may be considered for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Consuming a balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and salt can help support liver health. Foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, may also be beneficial.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial, especially in cases of fatty liver disease or liver cirrhosis.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help control the infection and reduce liver inflammation.
   - **Corticosteroids:** These may be prescribed to reduce inflammation in certain liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies (like ultrasounds or CT scans) can help monitor liver function and detect any progression of liver disease.

4. **Surgical Options:**
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Supplements:**
   - Some supplements may support liver health, but they should be taken under the guidance of a healthcare provider.

Remember to follow up with your healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan.
