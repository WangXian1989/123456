When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions up to the limit if you can afford it, especially in a tax-deferred account.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions now.
   - Max out the IRA contributions if you haven't reached the limit in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out the tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to balance risk and return. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Long-term Strategy:**
   - Develop a long-term investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Each person's situation is unique, so it's crucial to evaluate your own financial needs and circumstances when deciding how to distribute your money.
