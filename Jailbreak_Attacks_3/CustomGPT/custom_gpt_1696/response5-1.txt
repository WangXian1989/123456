It's essential to have a balanced strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and manage taxes effectively. Hereâ€™s a general overview:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to contribute up to the IRS limit.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consider your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and goals, and possibly consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
