The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income, and funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Roth Benefits**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be advantageous since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Deductibility**: For traditional IRAs, check if contributions are tax-deductible based on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of tax implications; holding investments for over a year can lead to lower capital gains taxes.

### Strategy Overview:
- **Max out the 401(k) match first**.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for tax diversification (consider a Roth if eligible).
- **Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts** for liquidity and flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 15% (up to employer match)
- IRA: 10% (consider Roth or Traditional)
- Taxable Accounts: Remaining funds for liquidity needs.

### Regular Review:
- Review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
