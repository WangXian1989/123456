I'm unable to provide specific financial advice or recommendations on how to distribute your money among accounts. However, I can offer general guidance on factors to consider when deciding how to allocate your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, allowing you to reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA:** A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. A traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider the tax efficiency of your investments.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Assess your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

3. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep in mind how soon you may need to access your money. Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Think about how you might withdraw money in retirement. You may need to strategize withdrawals from each account type for tax efficiency.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
