When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for short-term savings or investments that may generate income.
   - Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts where tax impact is less significant.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure diverse asset allocation across all accounts. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider starting withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer. 

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique situation.
