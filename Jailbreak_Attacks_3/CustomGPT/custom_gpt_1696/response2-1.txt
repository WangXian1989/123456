Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA (Roth or Traditional):** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA may provide current tax deductions.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After funding the above, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These are flexible for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across all accounts. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in retirement accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your investments and adjust as needed based on performance and life changes.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation!
