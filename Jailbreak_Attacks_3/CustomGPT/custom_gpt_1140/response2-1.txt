To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. Take advantage of employer matching if available.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maximizing your Roth IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income from these accounts is subject to capital gains taxes. It's best to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax liability.

2. **Investment Time Horizon:**
   - Long-term investments should be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Short-term investments or those you may need access to sooner can be placed in taxable accounts.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance your risk. Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Consider how much you'll need from each account type based on tax implications, required minimum distributions (RMDs), and your income needs.

5. **Contribution Limits:** 
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before considering additional investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary widely. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By strategically distributing your money among these accounts, you can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
