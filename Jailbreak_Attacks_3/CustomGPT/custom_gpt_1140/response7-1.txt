Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize your contributions to get the full benefit, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k) up to the match, consider an IRA. Depending on your income level, you may choose between a Traditional IRA (which may provide tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The contribution limits are typically lower than those for a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investing but do not provide the same tax benefits. It's wise to focus on investments that are more tax-efficient in these accounts, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts. Financial experts often recommend covering 3 to 6 months' worth of expenses.

5. **Diversification:** Regardless of the types of accounts you choose, diversification across various asset classes can help manage risk and potential returns over time.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

In summary, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) (especially to the employer match), consider IRA options next, and then utilize taxable accounts for additional investment growth.
