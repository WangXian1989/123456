Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Timeline:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Funds in your taxable account can be more accessible without penalties, making it suitable for short-term investments or unexpected expenses.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, as they offer potential tax savings on investment gains.

3. **Diversify Within Accounts:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy within each type of account to manage risk effectively.
   - Consider the tax implications of investment products in taxable accounts, as interest and dividends may be taxed at different rates.

4. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to meet your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
