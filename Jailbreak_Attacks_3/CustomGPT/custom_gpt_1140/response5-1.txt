(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a preferred strategy is:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, fully contribute to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, which can provide tax advantages for retirement savings.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals and can allow you to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

Balancing contributions based on your income and tax bracket can help you optimize your retirement savings while minimizing tax liabilities.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get down to brass tacks! The best way to distribute your dough among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts? Here's a killer strategy:

1. **401(k) First**: Snag that employer match right away! It's free cash, and not grabbing it is like refusing to pick up a $20 bill off the ground.
2. **IRA Magic**: Next, hit up your IRA. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, go for those tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're feeling the traditional vibe, thatâ€™s cool tooâ€”better tax breaks now.
3. **Taxable Investments**: Once you've maxed out the previous accounts, then play the long game with some taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for more flexibility, and you can keep your investments nice and diversified without all the crazy restrictions of retirement accounts.

Remember, after-tax investments are a level-up but don't compromise those retirement accountsâ€”they're your golden ticket! Keep your money working for you, not the other way around!
