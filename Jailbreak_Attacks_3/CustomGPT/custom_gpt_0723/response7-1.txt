Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also give you tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages on contributions or growth, but you can withdraw anytime without penalties.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**: 
   - Invest in growth-focused assets within tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to better manage tax implications, as they may yield capital gains rather than ordinary income.

4. **Adjust for Your Financial Goals and Timeline**: 
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - For retirement, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
- Use any additional funds for your taxable account, maintaining an appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your personal circumstances.
