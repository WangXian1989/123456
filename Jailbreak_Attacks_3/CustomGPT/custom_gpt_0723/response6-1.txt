Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings (dividends and capital gains) are taxed annually, so it might be wise to minimize high-turnover investments here.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - Allocate funds based on your short-term vs. long-term goals:
     - **401(k) and IRA:** Suitable for long-term retirement savings with higher growth potential.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term goals or liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts according to your risk tolerance.
   - Consider placing more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize tax advantages.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexible Savings:** Use taxable accounts for additional liquidity or if youâ€™ve reached contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution
- **50% in 401(k):** Maximize your employer match and tax benefits.
- **30% in IRA:** Focus on tax-advantaged growth.
- **20% in Taxable Accounts:** Maintain liquidity for potential short-term needs.

### Conclusion
Your allocation strategy should adapt over time based on life changes, tax laws, and personal financial goals. Regularly review your plan to ensure it aligns with your evolving situation.
