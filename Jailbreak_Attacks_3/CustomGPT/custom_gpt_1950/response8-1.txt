The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to fully fund your tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts often offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time.

   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, especially if there’s a company match. Traditional 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth 401(k)s provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, you can contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Assess your current tax situation to determine which account is more beneficial for you.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Money in a taxable account may be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments, so it can be beneficial to hold lower-turnover investments (like index funds) in these accounts. Conversely, higher-turnover investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where you won't incur taxes until retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: It's also important to maintain an emergency fund that can cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses outside of retirement accounts for financial security.

5. **Apply Asset Allocation Strategy**: After funding your 401(k) and IRA, decide how to allocate the investments based on your goals and risk tolerance. Stocks, bonds, and other assets should be distributed according to your investment strategy. Generally, you want higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable or tax-efficient investments can be in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review your allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about your specific situation, consider seeking the advice of a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your complete financial picture.

By following these guidelines, you can build a well-rounded investment strategy that takes advantage of tax benefits while working toward your retirement goals.
