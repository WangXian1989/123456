The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions. Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow without contribution limits, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell.

3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider the types of investments held in each account:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices; focus on a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Usually has a broader range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid investments and strategies to minimize taxes, such as tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, you might prioritize paying that off before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. You might want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your distribution with your financial goals, such as buying a home, funding education, or retiring early.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
