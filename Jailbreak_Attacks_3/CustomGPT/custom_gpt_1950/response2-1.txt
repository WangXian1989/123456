Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - *401(k)*: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer matches. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - *IRA*: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), direct additional savings to your IRA, especially if you're seeking to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable brokerage accounts for investments that may not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts, such as individual stocks or short-term investments. These can also provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment decisions in taxable accounts. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help manage your tax burden.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Itâ€™s a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
