Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize your tax benefits, investment growth, and access to funds. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) after reaching the employer match in your 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Evaluate Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth (Retirement Accounts):** Focus on higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where the tax benefits compound over time.
   - **Accessible Funds (Taxable Accounts):** Maintain a balance in your taxable account for short-term goals or emergencies. Consider more liquid assets or lower-risk investments here.

3. **Diversification of Assets:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk effectively. Ensure different asset classes are represented in both retirement and taxable accounts to leverage market volatility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications for Withdrawals:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Annual Review and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions as financial situations change. This will help maintain alignment with your long-term goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your needs.
