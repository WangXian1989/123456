I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, avoid alcohol, and maintain a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow up with blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In certain cases, procedures might be required to remove blockages or improve liver function.
5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe conditions, this may be the last resort.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
