Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer more flexibility and control over withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might lean more towards growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability and income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out contributions** to your 401(k) to employer match.
- **Contribute to Roth IRA** for tax-free growth.
- Allocate remaining funds to **taxable accounts** for flexibility.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your specific situation.
