I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. Here are a few approaches often considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid fatty, fried foods and limit sugar and salt intake.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol to reduce liver stress.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), a doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments.

3. **Weight Management**: 
   - If overweight, losing weight can improve liver function, particularly in cases of fatty liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some supplements, like milk thistle, are thought to support liver health, but consult your doctor before starting any.

6. **Advanced Treatments**: 
   - For severe cases, treatments like dialysis or liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
