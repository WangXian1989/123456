To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. 
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you meet the limits for tax-advantaged options, allocate funds to a taxable account for more accessible withdrawals.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Equal Risk Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified portfolio considering your risk tolerance. 
- **High-Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains. 

### 3. Contribution Limits
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, maximizing free money.
- **Consider IRA Roth Conversion**: Once maxed out on contributions, consider converting traditional IRA funds to Roth IRA for future tax-free growth.

### Summary:
- **Focus on tax advantages in 401(k) and IRA**.
- **Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity and diversification**. 

This structured approach will enhance your financial strategy over time.
