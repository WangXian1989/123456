To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to max out your contributions if possible. For 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (limit is $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50+). Choose based on your tax situation—Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or Traditional for tax deductions now.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These can be flexible and provide liquidity when needed.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments (401(k) and IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate lower capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, keeping a balance of equities and fixed income.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

By following these steps, you can strategically distribute your money to enhance growth and minimize taxes.
