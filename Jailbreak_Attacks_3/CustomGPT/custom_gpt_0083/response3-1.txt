Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can offer tax advantages and more investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments with lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains) or for savings needs in the near term.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed differently. Plan based on your future tax bracket.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts for risk management.

6. **Adjust Based on Age & Goals**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

This strategy can help you optimize growth while managing risk and taxes. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
