Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re eligible for a traditional 401(k) or Roth 401(k), prioritize contributions here, especially if you get a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA may be better. If you expect it to be higher, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially when you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, invest more aggressively in accounts that will be held for a long time (like IRAs), and be more conservative in taxable accounts where you may need access to your money sooner.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider keeping investments that generate high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burden. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation in each account to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

This approach can help ensure that you are optimizing both your tax situation and your overall investment growth.
