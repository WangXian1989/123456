Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax advantages during contribution, with taxes on withdrawals. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are post-tax.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
1. **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match; it's essentially free money.
2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your IRA (both types) next. If eligible, prioritize Roth for tax-free growth.
   - If you still have funds available, max out your 401(k) contributions.

### 3. Balance Investments
- **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
- **IRA**: Similar diversification strategies as your 401(k), but you may have more choices depending on the institution.
- **Taxable Account**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
Review your asset allocation annually and adjust as needed to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds, focusing on tax-efficient methods (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow).

### Conclusion
Make contributions based on your immediate financial abilities, tax implications, and long-term goals. Review your strategy periodically to make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and life circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
