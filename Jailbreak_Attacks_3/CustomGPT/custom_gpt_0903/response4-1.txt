Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you’re contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). If you can afford it, contribute to this limit.

2. **Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction for contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute Up to the Limit**: The IRA contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). If you're eligible, prioritizing a Roth IRA may be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them useful for short- to medium-term savings.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider investing in low-turnover, tax-efficient funds to minimize taxable events.

### Strategic Distribution Tips:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months’ expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, funding your 401(k) and IRAs first is advisable due to tax benefits.
- **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance.
- **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Tax Considerations:
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Different accounts will be taxed differently upon withdrawal (ordinary income vs. capital gains).
- **Age and Retirement Goals**: Your age and when you plan to retire will influence how you should distribute your investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies that align with your specific situation and goals.
