Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Holding low-turnover funds or tax-optimized funds can minimize taxes.

3. **Allocation Based on Time Horizon:**
   - If you're far from retirement, you might invest more aggressively in equities in growth-oriented accounts (like IRAs).
   - As retirement nears, shift towards more conservative investments in both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Investment Types:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider holding bonds or other interest-generating accounts in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that meets your specific needs.
