The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the match, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and access to your funds without penalty, but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, goals, and changes in your financial situation.

It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
