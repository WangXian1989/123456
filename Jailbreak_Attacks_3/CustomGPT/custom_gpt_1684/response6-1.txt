To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits and Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023) and potential employer matches; contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Allows for annual contributions up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older); Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but dividends and capital gains are taxable; a good option for funds you might need earlier than retirement age.

2. **Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term goals (such as buying a house or education): Consider prioritizing taxable accounts for greater liquidity.
   - Long-term retirement goals: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before considering taxable accounts.

**Recommended strategy**:
- Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible, focusing on the one that better fits your situation (Traditional vs. Roth).
- Use taxable accounts for any additional savings, especially if they align with short-term needs or if you’ve reached contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.
