The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions. Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but can provide flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have 3 to 6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account for emergencies.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Reevaluate Annually**: Review your investment distribution and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
