When considering the distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Employer Match First:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you can afford it, contribute the maximum allowable amount. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). The contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexible access to your funds without penalties, although you’ll need to consider the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize pre-tax accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to reduce your taxable income now. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts can be beneficial.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk and align with your financial goals. Your risk tolerance should guide the types of investments you choose.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in place, typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

7. **Regular Review:** Regularly review your allocations and performance and adjust as needed based on life changes or market conditions.
