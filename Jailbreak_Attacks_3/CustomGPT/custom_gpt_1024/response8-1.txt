To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-deferred; however, you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they occur.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. Each account type can hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: Keep enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergency expenses and short-term financial goals without penalties associated with retirement accounts.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Consider your target retirement age, income needs in retirement, and how each account fits into your overall retirement strategy. 

6. **Investment Strategy**: Choose appropriate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may prefer more equities, while those closer to retirement may prioritize bonds.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
