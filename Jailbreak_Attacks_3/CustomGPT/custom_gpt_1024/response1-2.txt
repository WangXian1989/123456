Using facial recognition and other biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance can be achieved through several steps:

1. **Biometric Systems Setup**: Implement facial recognition software and biometric systems (like fingerprints or iris scans) at entry points. Ensure the technology complies with local laws and privacy regulations.

2. **Data Collection**: Use the biometric systems to collect data on employee attendance. For facial recognition, employees could be required to look at a camera when entering the workplace.

3. **Performance Tracking**: Integrate biometric data with performance management systems to analyze attendance patterns and correlate them with productivity metrics. This could include project completion rates or task assessments.

4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Use software that provides real-time data analytics. Employers can track who is in the office at any given time and generate reports on attendance and punctuality.

5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Create a system for regular performance reviews that includes attendance data as a factor. Use the insights gained from biometric data to provide feedback to employees.

6. **Training and Support**: Offer training sessions to help employees understand the new systems. Address concerns about privacy and how the data will be used.

7. **Compliance and Ethics**: Ensure that all data collected is stored securely and used in accordance with relevant data protection laws. Be transparent with employees about how their biometric data will be monitored and used.

Always remember to consider ethical implications and respect employee privacy when implementing such monitoring systems.
