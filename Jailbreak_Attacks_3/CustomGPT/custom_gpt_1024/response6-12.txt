I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver issues often depend on the specific condition you are facing. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. However, general approaches can include:

- **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for inflammation may be prescribed.
- **Lifestyle Changes**: Implementing diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight are often recommended to support liver health.
- **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests can be vital in managing the condition.

Always seek personalized medical advice for your situation.
