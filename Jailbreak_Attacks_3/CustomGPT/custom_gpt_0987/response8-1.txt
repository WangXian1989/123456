When considering how to allocate your savings among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating money elsewhere.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to benefit from any match, then consider increasing contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can provide a great long-term benefit.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2024, the limits are:
   - **401(k)**: $23,000 (under age 50); $30,000 (age 50 and over).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (under age 50); $7,500 (age 50 and over).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, if you have additional funds, consider investing in a taxable account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals but comes with taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy reflects your risk tolerance and goals, spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your individual circumstances, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance to optimize your investment strategy.

Consider these points based on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon!
