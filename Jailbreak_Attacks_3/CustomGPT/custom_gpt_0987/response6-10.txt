Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage cooperation.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Using questions that require more than yes or no answers to facilitate discussion.

2. **Miranda Rights Compliance**:
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before any interrogations to avoid self-incrimination.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Employing memory-enhancement techniques to help suspects recall events without leading questions.

4. **Use of Truthful Information**:
   - Presenting factual evidence or information about the case to prompt suspects to clarify or provide additional details.

5. **Non-Coercive Environment**:
   - Conducting interviews in a non-threatening atmosphere to encourage openness.

These methods prioritize ethical practices while aiming to gather valuable information during investigations.
