Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth; best for retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Similarly tax-advantaged; consider traditional vs. Roth based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While not tax-advantaged, they offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if youâ€™re seeking tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use after-tax dollars for more flexible investing or to meet short-term goals.

### 3. **Consider Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) due to tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of tax implications; consider tax-efficient funds or investments.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for higher-income investments.
   - Hold investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### Summary:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for quick access.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.

Always remember to review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation or goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
