Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money. Since contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)s), they reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out an IRA, either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions), depending on your tax situation and future income expectations. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of capital gains tax on profits.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavy investment.
- **Tax Strategy**: Be aware of how different accounts affect your tax situation.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution with your short-term vs. long-term goals.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might skew more towards growth investments, while older individuals may want to focus on preservation of capital.

Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
