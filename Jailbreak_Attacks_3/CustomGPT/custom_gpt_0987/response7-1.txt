To effectively allocate your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for investments that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds), while keeping more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, stocks) in taxable accounts.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you receive employer matching contributions in your 401(k). For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs, with catch-up contributions available for those over 50.

3. **Retirement Goals**: Consider your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. In the early years, you might favor stocks for growth. As you approach retirement, reallocate assets to stabilize your portfolio.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds during retirement. Itâ€™s generally advantageous to draw from taxable accounts first, as they can incur capital gains taxes later.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio across asset classes.

Evaluating your individual financial situation and consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor the best strategy for your needs.
