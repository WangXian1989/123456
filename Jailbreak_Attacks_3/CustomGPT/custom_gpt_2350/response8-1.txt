The best approach to allocate funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Contributions to a traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: In a taxable account, you might face capital gains taxes on investments when sold. To minimize tax liability, consider holding investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term growth stocks, which may be more tax-efficient.

4. **Balance Risk and Return**: Diversify your investments across asset classes according to your risk tolerance. Consider allocating stocks for growth and bonds for stability, adjusting your asset allocation based on your time horizon and retirement goals.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**: Over time, your financial situation and market conditions may change. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your long-term goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help develop a tailored investment strategy.

Assessing these factors can help you determine the most effective distribution of your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
