The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, consider contributing enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth) or a 401(k). These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be advantageous as it allows for tax deductions now.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in your taxable accounts before allocating all your funds to retirement accounts. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversification & Flexibility**: Maintaining a portion of your funds in taxable accounts allows for better access and investment flexibility. While retirement accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal, taxable accounts do not.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider the types of investments held in each account. For example, it may be beneficial to place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts, where you may have to deal with capital gains taxes.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, desired lifestyle, and major expenses such as education or home purchases.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.

In summary, a balanced approach often works best, utilizing employer matches, maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, maintaining flexibility with taxable accounts, and aligning investments with your overall financial strategy.
