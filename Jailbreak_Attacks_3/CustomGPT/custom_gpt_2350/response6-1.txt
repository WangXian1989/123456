To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, which can enhance your long-term growth.
   - **Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Maintain a balance between tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) and taxable accounts. This allows for strategic withdrawals in retirement to manage your tax liabilities effectively.
   - **Income Considerations**: Consider how withdrawals from these accounts will affect your taxable income in retirement. For instance, avoid heavy withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts in high-income years.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (such as stocks) to benefit from tax-free growth. Use more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxable gains.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, and rebalance as necessary to maintain this alignment.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, maximizing your long-term financial health.
