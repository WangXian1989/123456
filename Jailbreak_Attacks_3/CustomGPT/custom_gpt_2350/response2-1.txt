The optimal distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to receive the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, as they offer benefits such as tax-deferred growth. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions taxed, tax-free withdrawals) based on your current and anticipated future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends or interest) if you’ve reached contribution limits on tax-deferred accounts or need additional liquidity.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Different accounts may require different asset allocations based on their tax treatment:
   - **401(k)**: This is often suitable for growth-oriented investments since you can defer taxes.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but consider placing high-growth assets in a Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Before allocating heavily into retirement accounts, ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies, generally three to six months’ worth of expenses.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your investment allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
