When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This offers tax advantages that can help grow your savings over time.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA contributions are set, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions up to the annual limit if feasible. The contributions reduce your taxable income if it’s a traditional 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds to invest beyond your retirement accounts, consider putting money into a taxable account. This offers flexibility in accessing your funds since there are no withdrawal penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Investment Strategy**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, you may allocate funds differently across these accounts. Generally, putting more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where capital gains are tax-deferred or tax-free) can be beneficial.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so it’s crucial to review and adjust your allocations periodically.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
