Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), IRAs provide tax-deferral or tax-free growth. Roth IRAs can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, like stocks for long-term capital gains or municipal bonds, which can provide tax advantages.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on how long you plan to invest before needing the money. Younger investors might favor growth investments (like stocks), while those closer to retirement might prefer safer investments (like bonds).

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across and within these accounts to manage risk effectively. Make sure to periodically rebalance your portfolio according to your investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because each person's financial situation is unique, working with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific needs.

Ultimately, the distribution should align with your overall financial strategy and goals.
