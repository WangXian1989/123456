I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that for liver problems, common treatments may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. They can guide you on the best options based on your specific condition.
