Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general steps you can consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement account offered by your employer, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)).
   - **IRA**: An Individual Retirement Account that allows you to save for retirement with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to receive the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible, as these accounts provide tax advantages and growth potential.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket, contributing to a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income now. Conversely, contributing to a Roth account could be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Evaluate Time Horizon**:
   - If you are younger and have a longer time to invest, you may prefer to take more risks with equity investments in your taxable accounts, where you should focus on long-term growth.
   - For short-term savings or if you are closer to retirement, consider more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. This helps reduce risk and improve potential returns.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.
   - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower tax rates.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and account performance. Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or life circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so make sure to consider all factors relevant to your financial situation.
