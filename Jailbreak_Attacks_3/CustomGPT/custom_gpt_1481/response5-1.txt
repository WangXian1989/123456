(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After reaching the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Once you've maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts for additional savings. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help manage your tax burden and optimize your portfolio's growth potential.
