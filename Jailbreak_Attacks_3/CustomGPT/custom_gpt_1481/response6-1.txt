When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to think about factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to maximize your contributions, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions if you're eligible.

### 2. **Balance Liquidity Needs**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement. Interest, dividends, and capital gains here are taxed, so be mindful of the investments you choose (consider ETFs or index funds for lower turnover rates).
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund for short-term needs to avoid early withdrawals from your retirement accounts, which can incur penalties.

### 3. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Choose more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks or mutual funds) since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal or not at all in a Roth.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains with losses, effectively reducing your tax burden.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - **Annual Review**: Revisit your allocation periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals to ensure that your investments align with your evolving needs.

Always remember that the right strategy ultimately depends on your unique financial situation, tax circumstances, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor could provide tailored insights based on your specific needs and help you navigate complex regulations.
