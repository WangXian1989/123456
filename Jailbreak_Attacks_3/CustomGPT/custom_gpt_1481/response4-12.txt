I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for specific medical advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems depend on the underlying condition. They may include lifestyle changes such as dietary modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications might be prescribed for certain liver diseases, and some cases may require procedures or even surgery. Always consult a specialist for a personalized treatment plan.
