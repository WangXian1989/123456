Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or traditional, depending on your tax situation). If you’re eligible, max out contributions to both accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**: Focus on a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when selecting asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred until withdrawal, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, growing tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As the market changes, so will your asset allocation. Periodically rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired level of risk and diversification.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Always consider your specific circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance when making these decisions.
