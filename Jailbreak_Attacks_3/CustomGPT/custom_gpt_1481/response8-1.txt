When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, age, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as regular income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so they may be best suited for investments you plan to hold long-term.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy, mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**: Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts. You may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to keep growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can help tailor an investment strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Always keep your overall financial plan in mind, and be sure to adjust your contributions as your financial situation or goals change.
