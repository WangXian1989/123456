Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if you can, as traditional 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

3. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt (like credit card debt) before aggressively investing, as the interest on such debt can outpace investment earnings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your long-term financial goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts in the future. For instance, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are generally taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that takes into account your specific financial situation and goals.

Overall, the best approach is to create a balanced portfolio that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while also maintaining flexibility and liquidity with taxable accounts.
