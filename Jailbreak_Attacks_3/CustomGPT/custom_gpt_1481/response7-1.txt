Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly impact your financial future, and the best approach often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize funding this account up to the match limit first. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider putting in the maximum allowable contribution if you can afford it, primarily for the tax-deferred growth potential.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Once you've maxed out or reached the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth but taxes are owed on withdrawals. The choice depends on your current tax situation and anticipated tax situation in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can then focus on taxable accounts. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but they offer more flexibility with withdrawals compared to retirement accounts. You might invest in index funds or ETFs in these accounts to minimize taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure you allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) are better suited for accounts where you won't need the money for a while (like retirement accounts), while more conservative investments (like bonds) might be appropriate for taxable accounts due to lower tax implications on interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep track of your overall asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
