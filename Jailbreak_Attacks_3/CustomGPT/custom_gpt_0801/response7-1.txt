To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions here if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket post-retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: A Traditional IRA also offers pre-tax contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider prioritizing Roth contributions. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be more advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher tax liabilities (like short-term capital gains) or for funds you may need before retirement. They provide more flexibility but may not offer the same tax advantages.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your goals. For long-term growth, you may want to allocate more to stocks and growth funds in your retirement accounts. In taxable accounts, consider index funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses. This will keep your investment strategy intact without needing to dip into retirement accounts prematurely.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Look at your total asset allocation rather than focusing on each account in isolation.

6. **Annual Reviews**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your personal financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
