When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first step.

2. **Open an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue to make contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. The contributions you make reduce your taxable income, potentially lowering your tax bill.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This could be beneficial for any short-term savings goals or investment strategies that may require liquidity.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: When investing in taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investment strategies. This can involve holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains and considering tax-loss harvesting strategies.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio's asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals. 

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so it may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.
