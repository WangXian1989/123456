Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have a high income and can benefit from the tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or investments. This should be your last priority for tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before investing heavily. 

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a strategy tailored to your situation.
