I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best approach often depends on the specific condition affecting your liver.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - A balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol and smoking.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Supplements like vitamin E for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
   - Other prescribed medications based on specific liver conditions.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider.
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people explore herbal remedies, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
