To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions first, as they are essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Can be a traditional or Roth; choose based on your current tax rate versus expected future rate. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds or ETFs) or after-tax dollars.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Tailor the investments in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term growth, consider equities in retirement accounts; prioritize liquidity and stability in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw from each account. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, regardless of account type.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to align your investments with your financial goals.

By evaluating your specific financial situation and goals, you can create a balanced approach to account allocation.
