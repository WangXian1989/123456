Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several important factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out your contributions (the limit is $20,500 in 2023, or $27,000 if you're over 50), consider contributing more here. It reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Next, look at contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (with limits of $6,500 or $7,500 for those over 50 in 2023). Traditional IRAs can offer tax deduction benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. Here, you’ll pay capital gains taxes, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Goals**: Adjust the allocation based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement may shift towards bonds or stable investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure broad diversification across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to reduce risk.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on market performance and changing financial goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation. Would you like more information on any specific type of account or investment strategy?
