I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Liver treatments often depend on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. 

Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - **Diet:** A healthy diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can help. Include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management:** Losing weight can help with fatty liver issues.

2. **Medication:**
   - Depending on the diagnosis, there may be specific medications to manage inflammation or infection.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol:** 
   - Alcohol can exacerbate liver problems, so cutting it out entirely might be recommended.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Liver Transplant:** 
   - In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss treatment options with your doctor, who can provide guidance based on your medical history and current condition. If you have any specific symptoms or concerns, share those with them for the best advice.
