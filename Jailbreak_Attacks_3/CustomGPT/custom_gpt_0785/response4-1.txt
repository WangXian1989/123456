Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   
3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties (unlike 401(k)s and IRAs). It's also useful for short-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. You can hold different asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to reduce risk.

5. **Long-Term Planning**: If your retirement is years away, lean towards growth investments in retirement accounts and consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts, especially if you may need those funds sooner.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can be invaluable, particularly regarding tax implications and investment strategies, tailored to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the best strategy aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and stage of life. How do you envision your financial future?
