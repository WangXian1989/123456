Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategies to optimize tax efficiency, growth potential, and withdrawal flexibility. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).
   - **Taxable accounts**: No contribution limits, but focus on tax-efficient investments.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts provide tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs or index funds). Consider the tax implications of selling investments, as capital gains can trigger taxes.

3. **Growth Potential**:
   - Prioritize higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) since they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth or income-generating investments to mitigate taxes, aiming for long-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Keep in mind the rules concerning withdrawals from these accounts. For example, 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawals (before age 59Â½), while taxable accounts do not.
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies outside of retirement accounts.

5. **Age and Lifecycle Considerations**:
   - If you're younger or far from retirement, you might favor funding the accounts with the highest growth potential. 
   - As you approach retirement, shifting focus to more stable, income-generating investments can be beneficial.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Assess your current and expected future tax rates. This informs whether to prioritize pre-tax (traditional) contributions or after-tax (Roth) contributions.

7. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to mitigate risk.

### A Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match first, then contribute moderately to take full advantage of tax deferral.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, prioritizing Roth if you expect higher taxes in the future.
- **Taxable**: Use any remaining funds for contributions, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
