Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Review the fees and investment options available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you qualify, aim to max out your IRA contributions, especially if youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement may be tax-free.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributions to taxable accounts. These accounts can offer flexibility, but interest and dividends are subject to taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, diversify your investments across all accounts. Equity-heavy investments might be better in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient options (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** 
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
