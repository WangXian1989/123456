Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA) for higher income years to reduce your taxable income.
   - In lower income years, consider converting funds from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA for tax benefits later on.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account to cover unexpected expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Younger investors can usually afford to take on more risk, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative investments.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
