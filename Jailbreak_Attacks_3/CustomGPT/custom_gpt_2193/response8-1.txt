The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: After capturing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, as these offer tax advantages.
   - **Continue Investing in 401(k)**: If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) beyond the match until you reach the annual contribution limit.

3. **Consider Investment Choices**: If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment options, you might prefer to direct more funds to your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or interest income, which are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. 
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Hold investments expected to appreciate in value over the long term in tax-advantaged accounts, where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account separate from these investments.

6. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation to maintain diversification across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
