To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on funding your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. Contributions to these accounts may reduce your taxable income, leading to tax benefits.

3. **IRA Contribution Limits**: For a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, be aware of annual contribution limits and whether you qualify for a tax deduction based on your income.

4. **Investment Growth Consideration**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly, as this growth will be tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth IRAs).

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to in the short term or for tax-efficient investments (such as index funds or municipal bonds).

6. **Balance Your Portfolio**: Regularly rebalance your investment portfolio across all accounts, ensuring that you maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you feel uncertain, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that utilizes the strengths of each account type.
