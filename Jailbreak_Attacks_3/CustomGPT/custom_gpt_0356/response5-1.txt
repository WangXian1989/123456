To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA. This helps you benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for tax-deferred growth. Focus on higher-income assets here to defer taxes.
   - **IRA**: If you have a Roth IRA, prioritize contributions here for tax-free growth. If traditional, treat similarly to a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-turnover assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax. Use this account for goals that fall within a shorter time frame.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Consider a diversified mix across all accounts, adjusting for the tax implications of each type.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity in your taxable accounts for unforeseen expenses. Make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think about your retirement timeline and asset growth. Adjust your allocations as you approach retirement, typically reducing risk.

6. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can offer personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
