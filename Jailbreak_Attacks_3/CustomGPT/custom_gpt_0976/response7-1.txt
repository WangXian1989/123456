Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for maximizing growth and minimizing taxes. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Great for those looking for tax benefits now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: You can access these funds without penalties before retirement age. Good for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Long-term investments (held over a year) are taxed at a lower rate.

### **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on 401(k) and IRAs to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Hold stocks (higher growth potential but more volatility) in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds (lower growth but stable) in taxable accounts to optimize taxes.
   - **Withdrawals**: If you're nearing retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy carefully to minimize tax impact from each account.

### **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider getting personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This approach will help you to optimize your investments and tax situation over time.
