Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to help you optimize your investments:

### 1. Understand the Accounts
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and funds grow tax-deferred.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributions to a Roth are made with after-tax dollars.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA if you want tax-deferred growth.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments, especially when you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### 3. Factor in Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs).
- **Long-Term Capital Gains**: Investments held in taxable accounts for over a year are taxed at a lower rate, making them suitable for long-term investments.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
- **Rebalance**: Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.
- **Adjust Contributions**: As income or financial situations change, adjust how much you contribute to each account.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- **Personalization**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can make informed decisions on how to distribute your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
