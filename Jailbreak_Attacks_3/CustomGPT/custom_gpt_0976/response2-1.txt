Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and high contribution limits. Ideal for retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Accounts also offer tax advantages (Traditional for tax-deferred growth; Roth for tax-free growth) but have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for withdrawals, but gains are taxed annually. Useful for short-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out 401(k) contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Adjust IRA contributions:** Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation. If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed.
   - **Invest in taxable accounts:** Once retirement accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for additional investing, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for high-earning years to reduce current taxable income.
   - Consider Roth contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Balance Your Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments within each account to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Adjust yearly as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### 5. **Review Periodically:**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and reallocations as needed.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough for the match, then max it out if possible.
- **Traditional IRA:** Max out if you’re eligible or consider a Roth IRA depending on your income.
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing retirement accounts, invest additional funds here with a focus on tax efficiency.
