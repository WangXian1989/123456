I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information on liver health. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medication:** Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may help manage symptoms or disease progression.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications.

4. **Surgery (if applicable):** In severe cases or conditions like liver cancer, surgical options such as liver transplantation may be considered.

Always discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.
