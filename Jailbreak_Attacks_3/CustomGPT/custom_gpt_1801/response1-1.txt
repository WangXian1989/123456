When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your retirement goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often funded by employer contributions, these accounts have higher contribution limits and may offer tax advantages (pre-tax contributions or Roth options).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs typically have lower contribution limits than 401(k) plans but provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes. They are not bound by contribution limits like retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize it. Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the max limit if you’re in a high tax bracket. It defers taxes and can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA next, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA is generally advisable.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexible investing and any short-term goals, as well as for assets that may generate capital gains that can be managed for tax efficiency.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks typically have a higher return potential but come with increased risk.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across your accounts to spread risk.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and to ensure you are not too heavily concentrated in any single investment or account type.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consult with a financial advisor. They can help fine-tune your strategy based on your goals and circumstances.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50% of your total investment contributions, focusing on employer match and growth investments.
- **IRA:** 30% split between traditional and Roth contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% for flexibility and growth, possibly investing in ETFs or dividend-paying stocks for additional income.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution of your money across these accounts depends on your unique financial situation. Focus on maximizing contributions where possible, considering tax implications, and maintaining a diversified and balanced portfolio.
