(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure this free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). If you're eligible, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit to take full advantage of tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for more flexible savings and investments that you may want to access sooner. These can also be useful for investments that generate long-term capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess your allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and your risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, hereâ€™s the lowdown: spreading your cash around like a smart investor is key. First off, donâ€™t leave free money on the tableâ€”max out that 401(k) if thereâ€™s a match. Itâ€™s like getting a solid bonus without lifting a finger. Next, consider throwing some bucks into an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional, thatâ€™s your call. If you have the dough, keep shoveling cash into your 401(k) until you hit those contribution limits.

Now, onto taxable accountsâ€”these are your playground for accessible funds. Theyâ€™re also great for stocks and ETFs that dish out lower tax rates on capital gains. Just donâ€™t forget to sprinkle in some rebalancing every now and then. Keep an eye on your portfolio so youâ€™re not losing track of your goals. And seriously, if you want to make sure youâ€™re not screwing it up, hit up a financial advisor to tailor this game plan just for you. Happy investing!
