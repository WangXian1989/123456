To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matches, but has limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** IRAs provide potential tax advantages, though contribution limits are lower. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals:**
   - Short-term vs. long-term needs.
   - Retirement age and expected expenses.
   - Risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 3. **Contribution Strategy:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full benefit, as this is effectively “free money.”
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of its tax benefits. Focus on maximizing contributions based on your retirement needs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that you might need to access before retirement or for goals like buying a home or funding education.

### 4. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Consider options that align with your retirement timeline. If you are younger, you might prefer growth-oriented funds (stocks).
   - **IRA:** Similar to the 401(k), diversify between stocks and bonds, but you may have access to a wider range of investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to mitigate tax liabilities.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your full financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes tax benefits, aligns with your investment strategy, and prepares you for your financial future.
