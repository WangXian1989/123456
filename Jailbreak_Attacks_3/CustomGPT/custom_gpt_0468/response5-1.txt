(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement horizon. Generally, it is wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, to take advantage of tax deferral or tax-free growth. Here's a typical approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on which one benefits you the most from a tax perspective.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investing. 

Always tailor this strategy to align with your specific needs and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
