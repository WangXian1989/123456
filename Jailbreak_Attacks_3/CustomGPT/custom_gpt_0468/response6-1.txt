When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced approach that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy is crucial. Hereâ€™s a guideline to help you structure your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you're eligible.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Investments:** Once you've maximized your contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties.
   - **Focus on Investments with Favorable Tax Treatment:** Consider putting investments that might produce significant taxable income (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider a Diversified Asset Allocation:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting the mix based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.
   - Regularly rebalance your assets to ensure you stay aligned with your investment goals.

4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Review your allocations periodically to adapt to changes in financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can work towards an optimal distribution of your money that balances tax efficiency, flexibility, and growth potential.
