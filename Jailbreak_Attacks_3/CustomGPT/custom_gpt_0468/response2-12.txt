I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medications**: Depending on your liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to manage symptoms and prevent progression.

2. **Lifestyle changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver is also crucial.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and catch any further issues early.

4. **Nutritional support**: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Some may benefit from consulting a dietician.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, procedures like liver resection or transplantation might be necessary.

6. **Alternative therapies**: Some explore options like herbal supplements; however, these should be approached with caution as they can sometimes cause more harm than good.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
