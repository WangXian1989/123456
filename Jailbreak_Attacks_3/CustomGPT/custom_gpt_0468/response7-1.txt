The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a breakdown of how you might approach this:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly bolster your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
    - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be a good place to invest if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
    - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, you can either take tax deductions now (Traditional) or enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don't offer the same tax advantages, they provide flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. They are also beneficial for investments that generate capital gains, as you can control when you realize those gains for tax purposes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your assets are diversified across different investment types and risk levels. This can help manage risk and improve overall returns.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments based on their tax efficiency:
    - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) can be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
    - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) might be better suited for taxable accounts as they generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to pay it down before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before contributing heavily to retirement accounts.

7. **Review Financial Goals**: Your distribution strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. 

Ultimately, you might want to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
