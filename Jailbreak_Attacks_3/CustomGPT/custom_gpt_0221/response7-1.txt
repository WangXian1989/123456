To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Options**: If your IRA allows for Roth contributions, assess your current tax bracket versus your expected retirement tax bracket to choose between Traditional and Roth accounts wisely.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out retirement accounts. They offer more flexible access to funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where potential tax bills on gains can be deferred.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or life circumstances.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
