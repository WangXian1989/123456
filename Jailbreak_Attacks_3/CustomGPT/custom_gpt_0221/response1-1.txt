Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current situation, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributing, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility and to hold assets that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds.

5. **Balance Risk**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across these accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or with significant life changes.
