Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your situation.
   - **401(k)**: Keep contributing if your employer offers a match.

### 3. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Stay within the annual contribution limits for each account to avoid penalties.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility in withdrawals.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using lower-risk investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) for tax efficiency.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to align it with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial professional can provide tailored advice based on your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money across your accounts to optimize growth and minimize taxes.
