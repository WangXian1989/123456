Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and future tax strategy.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you're investing for the long term (e.g., retirement decades away), you can afford to take on more risk in your portfolio.
   - For shorter horizons, focus on more stable investments.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Choose a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** This can also hold a diverse range of investments, but if it's a Roth IRA, consider growth investments for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and consider the tax implications of capital gains.

4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.
   - Hold assets likely to experience high growth in tax-advantaged accounts and lower growth assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Review and adjust your investments regularly to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy for your investments.
