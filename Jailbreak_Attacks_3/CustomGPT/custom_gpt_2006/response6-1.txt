To optimize your investment diversification and growth, consider the following strategies for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Assess Contributions Limits and Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions (up to $22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if age 50+). Benefit from employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Contribution limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+). Roth vs. Traditional choice based on tax projections.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for after-tax investments; prioritize for liquidity and flexibility.

### 2. **Investment Allocation Strategies**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) to shield gains from current taxation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold lower-growth or income-generating investments (e.g., bonds, dividend stocks) to manage tax liability efficiently.

### 3. **Monitoring and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess asset allocation to maintain desired risk levels.
   - Rebalance portfolios across accounts annually based on performance and life changes.

### 4. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**
   - Plan contributions based on projected income and tax rates in retirement. Utilize tax-efficient withdrawal strategies. 

By following these strategies, you can effectively balance growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity in your investment portfolio.
