Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** If you have an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions upfront, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax bracket.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).

### 4. **Investment Diversification**
   - **401(k):** Choose a diversified mix of funds (stocks, bonds) that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA & Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in low-cost index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure. Use tax-efficient strategies (like holding municipal bonds or index funds) to minimize taxes in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Consider Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering market changes and your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Retirement Timing and Withdrawals**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to optimize tax efficiency—consider the order of withdrawals from accounts to minimize overall tax burdens.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help tailor an investment strategy to meet your long-term goals.

By considering these factors carefully, you can develop a plan that aligns with your financial objectives while managing risks and tax implications effectively.
