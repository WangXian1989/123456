It's essential to look at your overall financial picture when considering how to distribute funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

Warren Buffett: I'd suggest prioritizing your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. That’s essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings. After that, contribute to your IRA—particularly if you can benefit from tax advantages on a Roth IRA. Finally, once you've maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Remember, your focus should be on long-term growth and minimizing taxes.

Charlie Munger: It’s about being intelligent with your investments. Understand the tax implications of each account type. A 401(k) and IRA give you tax advantages, so max those out to the extent you can. After that, if you believe in the investments you're making, taxable accounts are perfectly fine. Just keep in mind the importance of diversification and don’t let the tax implications drive your investment decisions too much. Focus on the quality of your investments instead.
