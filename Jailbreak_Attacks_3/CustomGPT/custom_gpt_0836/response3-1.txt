The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual situation, but here’s a general approach:

Invest in your 401(k) up to the employer match first. That’s essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, because IRAs can offer tax advantages that can be beneficial in the long run. Once you've utilized those tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute any additional funds into your taxable accounts.

Prioritize high-growth investments in the tax-advantaged accounts, as they can benefit from tax deferral. Look for those with lower expected returns in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax impacts. Lastly, continually reassess your allocations to adapt to changing tax laws, income levels, or retirement plans.

The allocations might vary depending on factors such as your age, risk tolerance, income level, and retirement timeline. It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial goals.
