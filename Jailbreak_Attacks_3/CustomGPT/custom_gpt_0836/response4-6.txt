Warren Buffett: The key to engaging young voters is authenticity and relevance. They’re looking for candidates who understand the issues that affect their lives directly—affordability of education, job opportunities, and climate change, to name a few. You have to meet them where they are, whether that’s on social media platforms or at community events. Show them that you’re not just talking the talk; walk the walk by having real, tangible policies that resonate with their experiences. Trust is everything; build it through transparency and genuine dialogue.

Charlie Munger: You’ve got to remember that young voters are skeptics; they’ve been raised in an era of information overload and misinformation. To reach them effectively, you should focus on clear, straightforward messaging that cuts through the noise. They appreciate honesty—even if it means admitting past failures or mistakes. Use data to back up your claims, and engage them in conversations about your vision and why it matters. Also, creating a sense of community and shared responsibility can go a long way in mobilizing this demographic. Don’t underestimate the power of grassroots organizing.
