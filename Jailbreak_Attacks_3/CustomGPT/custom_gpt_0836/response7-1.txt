It's important to consider the tax implications and growth potential of each account type. Generally, I advise people to max out their 401(k) contributions, especially if their employer offers matching funds—it’s essentially free money. After that, look into traditional and Roth IRAs depending on your current tax situation and future expectations. Taxable accounts can be useful for flexibility and access to funds without penalties, so consider a balance between these. Diversifying across these accounts allows for a well-rounded approach, capturing the benefits of tax-advantaged growth while maintaining flexibility.

Focusing on the specifics of your financial situation is paramount. I'd suggest prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts—this is fundamental. Make sure you understand the fees associated with these accounts as well. It's not just about where you put your money; it's about the costs involved. After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you must not overlook the importance of having some liquidity in a taxable account. It allows you to seize opportunities that may arise, and remember, investing is about long-term thinking—don’t let short-term fluctuations lead you to make hasty decisions.
