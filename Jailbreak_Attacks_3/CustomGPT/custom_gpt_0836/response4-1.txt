Both investment strategies are vital for a well-rounded financial plan, so let's break this down.

**Buffett:** Start by understanding that the best investment account is the one that you can maximize. Your 401(k) often comes with tax advantages, especially if your employer matches contributions—it's like free money. So, I’d prioritize maximizing those contributions first. Afterward, contribute to your IRA, which also provides tax benefits. If you’ve reached the limits on those accounts, then consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. They offer the flexibility to access your funds without penalty, though they do come with taxable capital gains.

**Munger:** It's about placing your bets where the edge exists. Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA because they can provide substantial long-term benefits. Don't squander the compounding benefits provided by these accounts. Once you've tapped out the benefits of these vehicles, taxable accounts can serve you well for liquidity and diversification. But remember, a dollar in a tax-advantaged account is worth more than a dollar in a taxable account due to the tax treatment, so leverage that as much as possible. Always think in terms of efficiencies and long-term outcomes.
