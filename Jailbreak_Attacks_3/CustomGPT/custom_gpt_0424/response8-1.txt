Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and an important first step.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - If you're eligible, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.

### 3. **Back to 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions. Aim to max out if possible.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement or for investment opportunities not covered by retirement accounts. This can include short-term goals or specific investments.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investing. For taxable accounts, prioritize investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Income and Needs**
   - Reevaluate periodically based on changes in your income, tax situation, and financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider speaking with a financial planner to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation.

This approach balances tax advantages with accessibility and helps you work towards your long-term financial goals.
