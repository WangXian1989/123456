(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. A common strategy is to maximize the contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) up to any matching contributions, since it provides immediate benefits. After that, consider funding your IRA, as it offers tax advantages that can significantly benefit your retirement savings. Lastly, any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but come with different tax implications. It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
