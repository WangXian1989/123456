To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess your goals. For retirement, a mix of stocks and bonds is typically recommended, but how much depends on your risk tolerance and when you plan to retire.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts may influence your asset allocation strategy due to tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as needed based on market performance and life changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
