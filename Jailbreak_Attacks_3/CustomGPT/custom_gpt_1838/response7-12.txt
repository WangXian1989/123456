I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific condition. Here are some general treatment options that may be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat the underlying cause, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and progress.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases or when liver cancer is present, surgery may be required to remove damaged tissue or, in extreme cases, a liver transplant.

5. **Alternative Treatments**: Some may explore herbal remedies or supplements, but these should be discussed with your healthcare provider first, as they can sometimes interfere with other medications.

Consulting with a hepatologist or a specialist in liver diseases is crucial for a tailored treatment plan.
