I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific condition, and in some cases, surgical options or liver transplants might be necessary. Always seek professional medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
