Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-advantaged accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket now since contributions lower your taxable income. Consider the investment options and fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. These accounts provide flexibility, though you’ll pay capital gains tax on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Keep lower-growth assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes to ensure they align with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your specific situation, including your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so personalize this approach to fit your needs.
