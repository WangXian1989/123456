Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,500 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Roth IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you need tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA can be more beneficial. Keep in mind income limits for deductions may apply.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for non-retirement goals, or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - **Investment Strategy**: Invest in tax-efficient products (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start with your 401(k) contributions to get the match, then max out your IRA.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Only after fully utilizing tax-advantaged accounts should you start investing in taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your account strategy with your short-term vs. long-term goals.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can typically take more risk in aggressive investments. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.
- **Tax Situation**: Analyze your current vs. future expected tax brackets to choose between Traditional vs. Roth options.

### Additional Tips:
- **Review Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio annually or if your goals change substantially.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.

By diversifying and allocating your investments wisely across these accounts, you'll set yourself up for a stronger financial future.
