Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here may incur capital gains taxes upon selling. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.
   - Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

4. **Evaluate Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift toward more conservative investments to protect your assets.
   - If you're younger, you might focus on growth investments.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or circumstances.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
