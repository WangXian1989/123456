I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your specific situation and recommend appropriate treatment options. Common treatments for liver issues can include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, surgeries or transplants. 

If you have any specific liver condition in mind, I can provide more tailored information, but please remember that a doctor's advice is essential in managing health issues effectively.
