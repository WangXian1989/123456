Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and is a critical first step.

2. **Tax Differences**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on realized gains and dividends. Consider using this for more flexible access to funds.

3. **Investment Timeline**:
   - If you are younger and have a long time horizon, consider a higher percentage in stocks within all accounts, balancing risk across tax-advantaged and taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax exposure.
   - If retirement is near, consider shifting more toward bonds or conservative investments, particularly in taxable accounts to keep tax implications in check.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, which can help minimize overall risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, especially during retirement. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
- **IRA**: If you qualify, max out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, then fund a traditional IRA if you might be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any investment goals beyond retirement or for funds you'll need access to before retirement age.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs and circumstances.
