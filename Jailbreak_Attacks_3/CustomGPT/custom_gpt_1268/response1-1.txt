Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It’s free money!

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs can offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth, investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly target-date funds.
   - IRAs can be used for similar investments, but consider more aggressive growth options if time is on your side.
   - Taxable accounts should focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Balance Risk**: Assess your risk tolerance and allocate assets accordingly. Younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those nearing retirement may prefer a more conservative approach.

6. **Periodic Review**: Reassess your allocations regularly to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

A common strategy is to first fund your 401(k) up to the match, then invest in an IRA, and if you have extra funds, put them in a taxable account.
