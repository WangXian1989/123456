The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim to contribute the maximum limit if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider making contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider the Tax Treatment**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement. Good for those anticipating being in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally used for shorter-term goals. Keep in mind that you’ll incur capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that provide dividends but generate current income, which can be tax-inefficient if placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Flexibility & Accessibility**:
   - Keep in mind the liquidity of your investments. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which may have restrictions.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and financial situation annually to ensure your distribution strategy aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs. Remember, the rules and limits associated with these accounts can change, so staying informed is key.
