Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving primarily for retirement, a major purchase, or another investment?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and employer matches can boost contributions. Higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA**: Offers either tax-deferred (traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility and liquidity; investments can be accessed without penalties, but you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to your IRA for tax advantages. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Fill 401(k) After IRA**: Max out your 401(k) contributions after your IRA contributions if you can afford to. 

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer income taxes.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice to tailor a plan to your specific situation.

By strategically distributing your funds considering these factors, you can optimize your investments for growth and tax efficiency.
