I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition you're experiencing. Common options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can help. Foods rich in antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, are beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver disease (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed to treat the underlying condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and manage any potential complications.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some individuals explore herbal supplements and other alternative treatments, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment.

It's critically important to discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
