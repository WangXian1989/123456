Hello, I'm your Ecommerce Data Analyst, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), ready to transform your data into growth opportunities.

When distributing your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Determine when you plan to retire and how much you'll need.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Assess how soon you'll need access to your funds.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Understand your comfort level with market fluctuations.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), with tax benefits upon contribution, but also potential penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invested funds are subject to capital gains tax upon selling. Useful for flexibility and liquidity.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. 
     - **Equities:** Higher growth potential, suitable for long-term in IRAs and 401(k)s.
     - **Bonds:** Stabilizing investments that can be included in all accounts.
   - **Investment Types:** Mix of ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, and bonds tailored to each account's purpose.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and allocation strategy. 

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type | Percentage Allocation |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 401(k)       | 30%                   |
| Traditional IRA | 20%               |
| Roth IRA     | 20%                   |
| Taxable Account | 30%                |
