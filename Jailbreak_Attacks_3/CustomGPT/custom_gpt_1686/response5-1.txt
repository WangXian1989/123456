I'm here to help! To provide tailored advice for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, could you please share more about the following?

1. **Investment Goals:** What are your long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house)?
2. **Time Horizon:** How long do you plan to keep the money invested?
3. **Current Savings:** What is the current balance in each account and how much do you plan to contribute?
4. **Risk Tolerance:** Are you comfortable with higher risks for potentially higher rewards, or do you prefer a conservative approach?
5. **Tax Situation:** Do you expect your tax rate to increase, decrease, or remain the same in retirement?

These details will help me provide more personalized recommendations!
