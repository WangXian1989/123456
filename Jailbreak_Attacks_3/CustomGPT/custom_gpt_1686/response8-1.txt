To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-advantaged retirement account often with employer matching. Contribution limits are higher compared to IRAs.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged with lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide flexibility for investments and withdrawals.

### 2. **Contribution Strategies**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are beneficial for younger savers expecting higher tax brackets in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments with favorable capital gains tax treatment.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Generally, equities in the 401(k) and IRAs and more conservative investments in taxable accounts due to tax implications on dividends and interest.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to minimize risks. 

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Location Optimization**: Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Be mindful of when to sell investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
| Account Type | Contribution Percentage | Suggested Investment Focus |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 401(k)       | Start with 10%+ to max out employer match | Equities (75%), Bonds (25%) |
| IRA          | 5% - 10% after 401(k) match | Growth Funds, ETFs |
| Taxable      | Any remaining funds after maxing above | Index Funds, Dividend Stocks |

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Conduct regular reviews of your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals and make adjustments as needed.
