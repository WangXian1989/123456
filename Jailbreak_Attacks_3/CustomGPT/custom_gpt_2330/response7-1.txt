To provide a meaningful answer to your question, I would need to know a little more about your financial situation and goals. However, I can start with some general guidelines on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a retirement account often offered by employers, which may include matching contributions. It typically allows for pre-tax contributions that can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This account can be a Traditional IRA (taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice between these depends upon your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where your investments are taxed yearly on dividends, interest, and realized capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), itâ€™s usually a good idea to contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible, as these accounts often have tax advantages.
   - Finally, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals since they're not bound by retirement age stipulations.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - If you are younger and have a long time until retirement, you might want to take a more aggressive approach with your investments, focusing heavily on growth in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - In contrast, if you are nearing retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds that produce fewer taxable events) in your taxable account.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds that generate more short-term capital gains) in your tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Make sure to frequently review and rebalance your investment allocations based on performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual financial situations, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice.
