To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it would be helpful to know your specific goals, such as your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are a few general principles you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it's often prudent to contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefit as the 401(k) for contributions, but also consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are made post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties, and you may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that the investments within each account are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalancing:** Regularly reviewing and rebalancing your portfolio across all accounts can help manage risk and maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund:** Keep enough in a liquid account separate from your investing accounts for unexpected expenses.
