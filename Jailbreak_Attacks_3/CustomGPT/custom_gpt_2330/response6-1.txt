Distributing your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for an effective distribution strategy:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw money in retirement. This can be an advantage if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold, as well as taxes on dividends and interest. Consider keeping assets that are likely to generate higher taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: For retirement savings, maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if your employer matches) and IRA first to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds needed for short-term goals (like buying a house) in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Investment Options**
   - **Diversification**: Utilize your 401(k) and IRA accounts for a diversified portfolio including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Stay aware of the limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k), IRA) and try to maximize your contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: At least to the employer match, then consider increasing contributions.
- **Fund IRA**: After 401(k), fund your IRA to take advantage of additional tax-deferred growth.
- **Allocate Any Extra Funds**: To a taxable account for flexibility and access.

### Summary
- Focus on tax implications of each account type.
- Align your investment strategy with your goals and timelines.
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts.

Tailoring this strategy further to your specific financial situation may involve consulting with a financial advisor for personalized investment advice.
