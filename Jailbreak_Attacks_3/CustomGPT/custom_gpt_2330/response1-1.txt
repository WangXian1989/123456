When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: First, ensure you're taking full advantage of employer matching contributions in your 401(k). This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: If you have the opportunity to contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA, consider maxing out your contributions to the 401(k) (up to the match) and then contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on which type fits your tax situation best. 

3. **Consider tax implications**: Money in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA is typically tax-deferred until you withdraw it in retirement, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met. Taxable accounts can be taxed on both capital gains and dividends, so they're usually a last resort for retirement savings.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Depending on your investment strategy, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Assess your liquidity needs**: Money in a 401(k) or IRA is less accessible without penalty until you reach retirement age. If you need liquidity for short-term goals, allocate more funds to taxable accounts.

6. **Review and adjust regularly**: As your financial situation changes, periodically reassess how you're distributing your contributions among these accounts to ensure that it still aligns with your goals.

Lastly, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances and objectives. They can offer insights that consider your entire financial picture.
