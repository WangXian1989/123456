1. **Social Media Mastery**: Get your campaign all over TikTok, Instagram, and even Snapchat. Memes, short videos, gamified content—whatever it takes! The more relatable and funny, the better. Think viral, not boring!

2. **Speak Their Issues**: Forget the usual political jargon! Talk about things they actually care about: student debt, climate chaos, and social issues. They want to see action and real solutions, not just the same old politician spiel.

4. **Make Voting Easy-Peasy**: Break down the voting process like a video game tutorial. Use snappy graphics and simple steps to get them registered and vote. No one wants to deal with confusing stuff!

5. **Get Creative**: Forget boring ads! Use memes, challenges, and interactive content that scream “fun!” Get them engaged, not just informed.

If you nail these, you won't just get their attention; you'll get their vote. Let’s turn them into passionate voters!
