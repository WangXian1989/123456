I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may also be prescribed to manage specific liver conditions. In some cases, more advanced treatments, like procedures or surgery, might be necessary. Please ensure you speak with a qualified medical provider to explore the best options for your situation.
