When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). These accounts offer tax advantages; contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two often depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Continue Contributions to Your 401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match and considering IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k). These accounts have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs and grow tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for funds you may need before retirement since they donâ€™t have the same withdrawal penalties or restrictions as retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Investing tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, can minimize tax liability. Additionally, consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Ultimately, the best distribution will rely on your unique financial situation, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
