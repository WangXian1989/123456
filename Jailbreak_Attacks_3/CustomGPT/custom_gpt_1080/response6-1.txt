Investing your money wisely across different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for a well-rounded financial strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you allocate your money effectively:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: A employer-sponsored retirement plan. Contributions may include employer matches and often provide tax advantages.  
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that allows tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are investment accounts that do not have tax advantages but provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.

### 2. Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - Aim to contribute enough to your **401(k)** to get the full employer match; this is free money.
  - Afterward, focus on maximizing your **IRA contributions**, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
  
- **Evaluate Additional Contributions**:
  - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a **taxable account** for access to investments without penalty.

### 3. Diversification of Investments
- Ensure that your investments in each account are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risks.

### Summary
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially to capture employer matches.
2. Contribute to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
3. Allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts for flexibility and growth.

Ultimately, regularly review your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions to adjust your strategy as needed. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
