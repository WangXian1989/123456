To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**

- **401(k) Plans:**
  - Employer-sponsored retirement accounts.
  - Contributions are often pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)).
  - Offer potential employer matches.

- **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts):**
  - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth.
  - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.
  
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Not tax-advantaged; you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends annually.
  - More flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

- Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money."
- Contribute to an IRA next, ideally using a Roth IRA if you qualify, for eventual tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- Allocate remaining funds to your 401(k) or other investment accounts based on your tax situation and financial goals.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**

- Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to reduce taxable income now or in retirement.
- Use taxable accounts for investment strategies that yield favorable tax treatment (e.g., holding stocks long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax).

### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**

- Different accounts can hold different asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). 
- Consider different tax implications and investment goals when deciding what to hold where.

### 5. **Review Your Goals and Time Horizon**

- Align the allocation of funds with your retirement timeline and investment goals.
- Use more aggressive investments in accounts meant for long-term growth and more conservative allocations placed in accounts you may access sooner.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**

- Periodically assess the performance of your investments and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary

- Start with employer matches, then contribute to IRAs, and finally allocate excess funds to taxable accounts.
- Diversify investments and align with financial goals, adjusting as necessary.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while optimizing for tax efficiency and growth potential. Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
