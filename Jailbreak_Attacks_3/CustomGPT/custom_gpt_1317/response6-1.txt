When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term needs since you may incur capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Analyze your goals (e.g., retirement age, risk tolerance) to decide how much to allocate to each account type.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual limits for each account to plan contributions effectively.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to manage risk.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA.
- Use taxable accounts for more immediate financial needs or specific strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
- Ensure a balance based on your broader financial strategy.
