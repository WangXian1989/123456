Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Hold assets that produce higher ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce your tax burden.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Allocate based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement based on the tax implications. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
