Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Types:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Flexibility:** If you want tax-free growth, prioritize the Roth IRA if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** Use for short-term goals since money can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains:** Be mindful of tax implications on gains; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions** to capture any employer match first.
- **Fund an IRA** up to the maximum limit (especially the Roth, if eligible).
- **Allocate Remaining Funds** to a taxable account, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatments (like index funds).

### Final Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Consider your Time Horizon:** Longer-term investments can tolerate higher risk, whereas nearer-term funds should be more conservative.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
