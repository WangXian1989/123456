Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - If eligible, prioritize maxing out contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Contribute to 401(k) After IRA**
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals. It's beneficial if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Investment Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering tax implications. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency Considerations**
   - Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 7. **Long-Term Planning**
   - Consider your time horizon and when you'll need the funds. Longer-term investments can benefit from tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.

### 8. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations and adjust based on changes in tax laws, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution strategy combines maximizing tax advantages, considering flexibility, and aligning with your financial goals. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
