To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and future expectations.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you stay within the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts where interest income is taxed more heavily.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations across all accounts, adjusting as needed to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Plan based on when youâ€™ll need the money. Avoid putting money in accounts with penalties for early withdrawal if you plan to access it soon.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your current vs. expected future tax bracket when deciding between taxable and tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially if your financial situation is complex.

Balancing these factors can help you create an effective distribution strategy tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.
