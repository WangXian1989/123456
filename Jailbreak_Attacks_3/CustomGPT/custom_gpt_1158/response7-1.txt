I'm glad to help you with your investment strategy! Here's a general approach to distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - **Types:** Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Traditional contributions are pre-tax; you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** With a Traditional IRA, taxes are deferred until withdrawal. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider using these accounts for investments that generate lower taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Balance stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax-efficient investments:** Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in retirement accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your overall asset allocation and rebalance periodically to maintain your target percentages across all accounts.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax implications, considering which accounts to draw from first.

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor the strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
- **Stay Informed:** Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes.

This approach can help you optimize your savings and minimize taxes over time.
