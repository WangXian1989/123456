To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; ideal for high-income years. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRA: Contributions might be tax-deductible. Taxed upon withdrawal.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits and income tax on dividends.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you maximize any employer matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Typically, hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) due to long-term growth potential and tax deferral.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts to mitigate short-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax brackets and future income needs. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first, then from tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from Roth accounts, if feasible.

5. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Maintain sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all account types to manage risk effectively.

It's advisable to periodically review your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
