To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs can provide tax advantages and grow tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable brokerage account. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals and investment options, though you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, maintain a proper asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk assets can go in accounts with long-term horizons like 401(k)s and IRAs, while more liquid investments might be better in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of the tax implications of each account. For example, consider placing high-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your long-term financial goals.
