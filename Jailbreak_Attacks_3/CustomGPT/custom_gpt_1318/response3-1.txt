Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to guide you:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, education, or another purpose? Each goal may require a different investment strategy.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with variations in contribution limits and potential tax deductibility, depending on income and other factors. There are traditional IRAs (pre-tax) and Roth IRAs (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts subject to capital gains tax on profitable sales and income tax on dividends and interest. These accounts offer more flexibility but less tax advantage.

3. **Create a Strategy**:
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your employer’s 401(k) if they offer a match; this is essentially free money.
   - Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - After contributing to retirement accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement age.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon:
   - More aggressive growth strategies (higher stock allocation) may be suitable for longer time frames.
   - More conservative strategies (higher bond allocation) may be better if nearing retirement.

5. **Regularly Review Your Portfolio**: Monitor your investments and reevaluate your allocation periodically, adjusting as your goals, tax laws, or market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can offer personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds across your retirement and taxable accounts.
