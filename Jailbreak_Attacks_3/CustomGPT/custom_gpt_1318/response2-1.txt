When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer match programs, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Prioritize maximizing any employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, whereas a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are flexible, providing access to funds without penalties, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maxing Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. After that, consider contributing to an IRA, focusing first on a Roth IRA if you're eligible.
   - Post 401(k) and IRA contributions, if you have additional savings, direct funds to a taxable account for more liquidity.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are beneficial for those in higher tax brackets, while tax-free accounts (Roth IRA) may be better suited for individuals in lower tax brackets.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to enjoy favorable tax rates.

4. **Diversification and Time Horizon:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts considering age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Younger individuals may prefer stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might focus on bonds or income-producing assets.

5. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance, life changes, and shifts in financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your unique situation.

By balancing contributions based on these considerations, you can work toward a diversified and tax-efficient investment strategy!
