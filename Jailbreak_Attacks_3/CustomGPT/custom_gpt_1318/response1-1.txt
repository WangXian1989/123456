The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA also offers tax deductions for contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are typically taxed at lower rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, aim to create a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial professional to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, it’s about finding the right balance that maximizes your investment growth while factoring in your personal financial situation and tax implications.
