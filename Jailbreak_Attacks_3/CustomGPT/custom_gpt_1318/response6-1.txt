Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Tax Advantages
- **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by fully utilizing employer match programs in your 401(k) and contributing to an IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.
- **Consider ROTH vs. Traditional**: Depending on your current tax bracket and future expectations, decide whether to put money in a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible now) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

### 2. Diversification and Liquidity
- **Allocate for Diversification**: Balance your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within these accounts to mitigate risk. Typically, growth investments can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments may be suitable for taxable accounts.
- **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some cash or easily liquidated assets in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as withdrawing from retirement accounts may incur penalties or taxes.

### General Recommendations:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if there's an employer match, given its tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA**: Utilize this to supplement your retirement savings, keeping track of the contribution limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility in accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

Utilizing a well-structured mix of these accounts can lead to a more effective overall investment strategy aimed at maximizing returns while managing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs and objectives.
