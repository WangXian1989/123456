To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax if it's a Roth 401(k)), which lowers your taxable income. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have a contribution limit of $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Roth IRAs have similar limits but are subject to income restrictions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you will owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Advantages**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to your IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments, especially for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth to take advantage of compounding and tax benefits.
   - **Medium to Short-Term**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to sooner, as there are no penalties for withdrawals.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining growth-focused investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out your contributions, especially to capture any employer match.
2. **IRA**: Fully fund your IRA accounts based on your tax strategy (Traditional vs. Roth).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds here, focusing on assets that minimize tax implications, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### Consult with a Financial Advisor:
Personal circumstances vary widely, and a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your needs, considering factors like current income, expected retirement lifestyle, and future tax brackets.

By following these guidelines, you can structure your investment strategy effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
