To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating excess funds to a taxable account. This is beneficial for money you might need in the short term since these accounts are more flexible for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Keep higher growth investments like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Income Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place more income-producing investments like bonds in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income since it is taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Review Your Investments**: Regularly assess your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance your portfolio as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to talk to a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially regarding your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your tax advantages while maintaining liquidity in your investments.
