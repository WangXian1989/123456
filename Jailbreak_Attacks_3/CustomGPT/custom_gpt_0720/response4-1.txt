When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance and timeline. 
   - In your 401(k) and IRAs, consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your age and retirement goals.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, since these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Use your taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) that benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Aim to contribute regularly to each account, adjusting contributions based on changes in your financial situation, such as raises or bonuses.

6. **Periodic Rebalancing**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as you get closer to retirement.

Since personal finance can be complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your situation.
