I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver problems, it's really important to talk to a healthcare professional who can give you proper advice. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Some common options might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or in some cases, procedures to address more serious issues. Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
