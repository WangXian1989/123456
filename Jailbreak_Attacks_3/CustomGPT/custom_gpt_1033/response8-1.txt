To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer match; contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility but taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your IRA if you're eligible (Roth vs. Traditional based on your tax situation).
   - After maxing out employer match in your 401(k), consider making additional contributions to your IRA.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you're diversifying not only among account types but also within each account to mitigate risks.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: Review your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or retirement goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A tailored plan based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance can be beneficial.

By balancing contributions according to these principles, you can optimize your long-term growth potential while managing your tax burden effectively.
