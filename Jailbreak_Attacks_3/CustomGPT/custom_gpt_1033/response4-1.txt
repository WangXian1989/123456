Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, it’s beneficial to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Account**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Favor investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover.

3. **Assess Your Investment Options**: Each account may offer different investment choices with varying fees. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs in all accounts.

4. **Determine Your Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for the long term (like retirement), aggressive growth investments may be suitable for your 401(k) and IRA. In a taxable account, consider more stable investments to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts, not just one.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As the markets fluctuate, ensure your asset allocation stays aligned with your goals. Periodic rebalancing can help maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

Remember, these strategies may vary based on your individual circumstances and changing financial goals.
