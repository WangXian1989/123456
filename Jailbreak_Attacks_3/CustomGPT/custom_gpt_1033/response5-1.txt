(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize your contributions if possible, as these funds are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can be ideal for short-term goals or for investments that may generate tax-efficient income.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your job has a 401(k) match, thatâ€™s a no-brainerâ€”max it out! Free money is like finding cash in your coat pocket. Aim for the max contribution if you can swing it.

2. **IRA**: Next, look at IRAs. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, go for it! Itâ€™s golden for tax-free growth. If not, traditional IRAs can still offer tax benefits. Just think about your future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, once those are maxed out, hit up taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re perfect for investing that sweet cash flow or reaching short-term goals. Plus, long-term capital gains are nice and low.
