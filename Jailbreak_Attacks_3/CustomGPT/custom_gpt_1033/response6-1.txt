Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Investment Growth**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding investments long-term to optimize tax efficiency.

### 3. **Assess Your Income Needs**:
   - Allocate funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or withdrawals, since tax-advantaged accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Return**:
   - Diversification across these accounts can help mitigate risk. Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor your distribution strategy as market conditions and personal circumstances change. Adjust contributions based on performance and life events.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and help optimize your strategy.

By strategically distributing funds among these accounts, you can maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
