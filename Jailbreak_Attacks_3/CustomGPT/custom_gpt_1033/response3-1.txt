Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Benefits**: Often has employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize employer match first. If you can afford more, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions.
     - Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: 
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
     - If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA might be the way to go.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Benefits**: More flexibility with withdrawals and no contribution limits. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments.
   - **Strategy**: Use this account for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate qualified dividends (which are taxed at a lower rate).

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize Savings**: Focus on contributions that maximize employer matches first, then consider tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs.
- **Diversify Investments**: Aim for a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and growth.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.
