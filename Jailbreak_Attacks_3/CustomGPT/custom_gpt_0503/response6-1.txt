Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to receive the full employer match**, if offered, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution limit for 2024:** $23,000 (or $30,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - **Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA** to further increase your tax-advantaged savings.
   - **Contribution limit for 2024:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).
   - **Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement**; opt for Traditional if you need the tax deduction now.

### 3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**  
   - After maxing out the above accounts, **allocate extra funds to a taxable brokerage account** for more flexible access.
   - **Consider using this account for investments that yield capital gains** (which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income).
   - **Use tax-efficient funds** (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your **risk tolerance** and **investment horizon** across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance periodically** to maintain your desired level of asset allocation.

### Considerations
- **Emergency fund:** Ensure you have savings set aside before heavily investing.
- **Debt management:** Pay down high-interest debt before aggressive saving and investing.

By thoughtfully allocating money among these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement and take advantage of various tax benefits. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
