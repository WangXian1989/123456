To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):**
     - Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income.
     - Good for long-term growth; penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
     - Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - Roth IRAs feature tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.
     - Good for short-term goals and emergencies.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - Consider your time horizon (short, medium, or long-term) and risk tolerance.
   - Allocate more towards stocks in accounts meant for growth, while maintaining bonds or safer investments for shorter timeframes.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Stay mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type.
   - Maximize employer matching in your 401(k) before contributing more to IRAs or taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across various assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
   - Ensure diversification within each account type.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, particularly if there's an employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute enough to get to the maximum limit, considering tax impact.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for flexible investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Tips
- Rebalance periodically based on changing goals, market conditions, and life changes.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your savings while considering taxes and growth potential.
