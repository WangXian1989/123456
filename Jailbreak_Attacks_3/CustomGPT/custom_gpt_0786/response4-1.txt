Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), prioritize paying that down before maximizing your retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Accounts:**
   - Maintain a mix of tax-advantaged (401(k), IRA) and taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Long-Term Growth Focus:**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments, as you won't pay taxes on capital gains until you withdraw.

6. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping potentially high-growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments:**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial objectives and market conditions.

Ultimately, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial situation.
