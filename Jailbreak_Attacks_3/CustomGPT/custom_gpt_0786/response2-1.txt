To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. It's suitable for higher tax-bracket individuals. If your employer matches contributions, maximize that benefit first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upon contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current versus future tax expectations. Generally, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have tax advantages, so hold investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax burdens.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Build a diversified portfolio considering your risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and financial goals. Equities generally provide higher growth potential but come with higher risks.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth, tax-inefficient assets (like REITs or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes. Use your taxable account for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to avoid penalties. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (with a catch-up option) and $6,500 for IRAs.

4. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Emphasize a long-term investment approach. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account before heavily funding investment accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Using these strategies can help you build a well-rounded investment portfolio while maximizing tax efficiency.
