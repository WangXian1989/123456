To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Prioritize contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more to equity-heavy investments in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth potential.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid or conservative investments in taxable accounts to allow for easier access and reduced risk.

### 3. **Tax-Efficient Investment Placement**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Hold higher-income investments that generate interest or dividends (e.g., bonds) to avoid annual taxation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable capital gains.

### 4. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account and adjust your strategy accordingly. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000, and the IRA limit is $6,500, plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50.

### 5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with changing goals or risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Minimize high fees associated with investments, particularly in taxable accounts where capital gains can incur additional tax burdens.

By strategically distributing your investments based on these guidelines, you can optimize growth while considering tax implications and accessibility.
