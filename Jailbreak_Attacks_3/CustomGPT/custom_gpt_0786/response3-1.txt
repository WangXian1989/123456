Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year of contribution.

2. **IRA Accounts** (Traditional vs. Roth):
   - **Consider Tax Implications**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of the annual contribution limits and plan accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and can be access without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which have restrictions.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains rather than interest income to manage tax liability.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match, then maximize your IRA contributions.
2. **Distribute Remaining Funds**: After meeting your retirement account limits, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts.
3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, changes in income, and financial goals.

### Additional Tips:
- **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Ensure asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation. 

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments, tax efficiency, and retirement readiness.
