Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or other objectives?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax, but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the maximum match.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-income years to reduce taxable income.
   - Use Roth IRAs for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Consider risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an accessible emergency fund in a taxable account to handle unexpected expenses without tapping retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Establish a consistent contribution strategy that aligns with your budget, focusing on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts before taxable ones.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and account performance, making adjustments as life circumstances or financial goals change.

9. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy suited to your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
