The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are not receiving a match.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for an IRA (Traditional or Roth), consider contributing to it as well. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without being taxed.
   - Hold bonds and other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across all accounts in a balanced way. Ensure diversification in asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type.

5. **Adjust Based on Regulations**: Be mindful of contribution limits and the tax implications of liquidating assets within your taxable accounts.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs and objectives.
