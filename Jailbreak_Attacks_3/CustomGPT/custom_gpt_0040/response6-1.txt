Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some considerations for optimal distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out if you can, considering potential tax deferral benefits.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. A traditional IRA may be more beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These include investments that may be subject to capital gains tax. Use these for investments that you may need to liquidate before retirement or for assets that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically offer a wider range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, which can be tailored to your risk profile.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: May give you the flexibility to invest in higher-risk assets since you can access them without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation across all accounts reflects your long-term investment strategy, balancing between stocks and bonds according to your risk profile.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can enhance your overall savings and potentially reduce your tax liability. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
