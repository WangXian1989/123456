Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are steps to create an effective allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Tax-advantaged retirement savings account; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement investment accounts. You'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Long-term growth should be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in an easily accessible account, separate from investments.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your IRA after getting the match. The annual limits are lower than those for a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for additional savings and investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your allocation based on time horizon and risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors can afford more risk (stocks), while older investors may prefer lower-risk options (bonds).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Contribute to your 401(k) for tax deferral if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax consequences of withdrawals from each account, especially with traditional IRAs and 401(k)s.

### 6. **Regularly Rebalance and Review**
   - **Rebalancing**: Adjust your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially after significant market movements.
   - **Annual Review**: Continuously assess your financial goals and market conditions, adjusting contributions and allocations as necessary.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, focus on maintaining a balanced investment strategy, and consider the tax implications of withdrawals to maximize your long-term financial growth.
