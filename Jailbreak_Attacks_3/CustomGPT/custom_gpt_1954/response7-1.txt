Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, where your investments can grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

### 3. **Assess Your Current Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth options for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If your current tax rate is higher, a traditional 401(k) or IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Allocate Funds Based on Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep money for immediate needs in a taxable account for easy access.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth since theyâ€™re designed for retirement savings.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. 
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid and short-term investments, while holding riskier assets in your tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation periodically and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals by balancing between these accounts to optimize tax implications.

### Conclusion
Each person's situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
