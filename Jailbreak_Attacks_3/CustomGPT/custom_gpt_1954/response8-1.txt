The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Contribute as much as you can up to the annual contribution limit. For 2024, this limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older, including catch-up contributions.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Prioritize Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Determine if a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) aligns better with your tax strategy and retirement goals.
   - **Maximize IRA Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest in Tax-Efficient Funds**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Consider a Balanced Approach**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts, focusing on investments that align with your financial timeline.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - **Build a Safety Net**: Ensure you have sufficient funds in an easily accessible savings account before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

5. **Evaluate Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).

6. **Tax Management**:
   - **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan withdrawal strategies post-retirement. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts for tax efficiency.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - **Regularly Reassess**: Revisit your distribution strategy regularly, especially as your financial situation changes or tax laws evolve.
