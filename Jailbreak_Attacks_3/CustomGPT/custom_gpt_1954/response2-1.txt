When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, such as retirement, buying a home, or education expenses, as this will guide your strategy.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Traditional withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can be sold at any time, but you'll owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - Start with maxing out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before allocating funds to taxable accounts.
   - If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

6. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider a more aggressive investment strategy in tax-advantaged accounts since withdrawals are often far in the future.
   - In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax impact.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and adjustments to your goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or your situation is complex, consider getting personalized advice from a financial professional.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments while managing tax liabilities effectively.
