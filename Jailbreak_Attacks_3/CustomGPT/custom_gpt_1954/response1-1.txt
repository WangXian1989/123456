When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits and can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider keeping investments that may generate higher returns and may not produce significant taxable income.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place your high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level across all accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual goals, financial situation, and tax circumstances.
