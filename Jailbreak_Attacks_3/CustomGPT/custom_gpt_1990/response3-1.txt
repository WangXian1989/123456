To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Diversification:**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Fees:**
   - Be mindful of investment fees in your 401(k) and choose low-cost options where possible.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications, prioritizing accounts like taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

By balancing contributions and taking a strategic approach to taxation and diversification, you can optimize your investment portfolio. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
