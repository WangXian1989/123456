To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute the maximum to your IRA, as it offers tax benefits.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, channel additional funds into your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments meant for shorter-term goals, as they provide more access without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
