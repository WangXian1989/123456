Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### Considerations for Allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit. Consider traditional vs. Roth based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for flexibility and withdrawals before retirement age without penalties. This is useful for short-term goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **401(k)**: Aim for 15-20% of your income, maxing out if possible.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investments in a diversified portfolio.

### Rebalance Periodically:
- Review and adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and objectives.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Tailoring this strategy to your specific situation can yield the best results.
