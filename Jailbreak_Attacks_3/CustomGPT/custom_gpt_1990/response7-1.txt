Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest here for flexibility, but be aware of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure high-interest debt is managed and maintain an emergency fund before heavily investing.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

### 5. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term goals and consider taxable accounts for short-term needs.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Income and Tax Bracket**
   - If your income fluctuates, consider adjusting contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts accordingly.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
