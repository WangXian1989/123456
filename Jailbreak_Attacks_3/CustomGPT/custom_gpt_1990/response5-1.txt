Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Consider Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Allocate funds here to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Choose Roth for Tax-Free Growth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments with lower capital gains, like index funds or ETFs.

### Example Strategy
- **Younger Investors**: 70% in 401(k) and IRA, 30% in taxable accounts.
- **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments and increase taxable account holdings for liquidity.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Tailor your distribution to your specific circumstances and tax situation for optimal results.
