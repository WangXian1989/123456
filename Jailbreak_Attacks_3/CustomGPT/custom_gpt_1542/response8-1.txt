Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to grow your retirement funds.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on your current tax situation and whether you anticipate being in a higher or lower tax bracket during retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts:** If you have any high-interest debts (like credit card debt), consider paying those off before making additional contributions. The interest on such debts can outweigh the benefits of investment growth.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** After getting the match and contributing to an IRA, continue to maximize your contributions to your 401(k), up to the annual contribution limit.

5. **Consider a Taxable Account:** If you’re already maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional savings. This can provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties but remember that any investment gains will be subject to taxes.

6. **Diversification Across Accounts:** Ensure that your investments are diversified across all these accounts. This helps mitigate risk. Consider your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your overall investment strategy, regardless of the account type.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help you devise a stronger strategy based on your goals and financial situation.
