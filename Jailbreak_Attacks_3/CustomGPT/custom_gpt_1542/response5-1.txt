(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, maximize your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may provide tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial depending on your income level.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. This can be useful for short-term goals or liquidity needs, and you have the flexibility to access funds without penalties.

Diversifying your investments across these accounts can also help manage taxes effectively. Itâ€™s recommended to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so you want to figure out the best way to spread your cash across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts? Hereâ€™s a quick and dirty on how to do it like a pro:

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: First off, hit that 401(k) hardâ€”especially if your employer matches. You basically want to grab that free money with both hands and hold on tight.

2. **IRA - Go for a Roth If You Can**: If you qualify, jump on a Roth IRA. You pay the taxes now and snag tax-free withdrawals later. If you're on the higher income side and can't contribute to a Roth, just do a Traditional IRA and hope your tax situation improves down the line.

3. **Taxable Accounts â€“ Flexibility is Key**: Stash some cash in taxable accounts for stuff that might come up sooner. Theyâ€™re not as tax-efficient, but they give you mad flexibility without penalties when you need access to your funds.

And remember: always keep an eye on your tax situation when you're shuffling money around. Sometimes leaning more into one account can save some serious cash! If you get lost or overwhelmed, donâ€™t hesitate to hit up a financial advisor to help you navigate through the numbers!
