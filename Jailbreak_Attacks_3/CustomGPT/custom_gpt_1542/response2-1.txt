Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - If you're eligible, prioritize Roth IRAs for their tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit after maximizing the IRA.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Generally, keeping bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize taxes, while placing stocks in taxable accounts can be beneficial for long-term capital gains treatment.
   - Consult a tax professional to optimize your asset placement based on capital gains tax rates.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you might prefer to shift some assets into more stable investments within your accounts.
   - If you’re younger, you might focus on growth-oriented investments while maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

7. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement, as taxable accounts typically have fewer restrictions and can provide flexibility.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
