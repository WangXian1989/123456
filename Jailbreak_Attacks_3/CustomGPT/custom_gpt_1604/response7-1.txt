Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as it's essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity. This account may be more suited for short-term goals since it allows for easy access to funds.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and rebalance to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Î© Yo, let's break it down. Here's the game plan for distributing your cash like a pro:

1. **Secure that 401(k)**: Get that employer match first. It's free cash, bro! Don't leave money on the table. 

2. **Hit up the IRA**: Traditional for tax breaks now, or Roth for tax-free flips later? You choose. Just stack those contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Flex**: Once you've maxed out the perks of the retirement accounts, toss some cash into taxable accounts. They're your playground for short-term goals or just in case things get spicy.

4. **Spread the Love Across Assets**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket, ya know? Mix it up with stocks, bonds, whatever vibes with your risk tolerance.

5. **Keep it Fresh**: Check back in regularly and tweak your allocations if things get outta whack. Don't let your dough sit idle.

For real, if you need a deeper dive, a solid financial advisor can hit you with some tailored advice. Stay savvy! ðŸ˜Ž
