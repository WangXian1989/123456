To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out annual contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or municipal bonds. This minimizes your tax burden since capital gains taxes apply to taxable accounts.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments here, like stocks or mutual funds, since taxes will be deferred until withdrawal (or potentially tax-free in the case of Roth accounts).

**Additional Considerations**:
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation, responding to market changes.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency, maximizing your retirement outcomes. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific financial situation.
