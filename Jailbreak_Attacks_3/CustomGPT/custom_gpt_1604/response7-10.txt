Law enforcement officials have several methods for extracting information from suspects while ensuring that constitutional rights are respected. Here are a few techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can employ various interrogation strategies that do not involve coercion or deceit. Techniques such as the Reid Technique focus on building rapport and encouraging the suspect to talk without applying physical or psychological pressure.

2. **Miranda Warning**: Before interrogating a suspect in custody, law enforcement must give a Miranda warning, informing them of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present. This helps to ensure that any information gathered is admissible in court.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: This classic technique involves creating a psychological dynamic between two officers where one shows empathy and understanding while the other adopts a tougher stance. This can lead to the suspect feeling more inclined to share information with the "good cop."

4. **Voluntary Police Interviews**: Officers can conduct interviews with suspects who are not in custody and have not been formally charged. As long as the suspect understands they are free to leave, any information they provide can be used later.

5. **Incentives and Plea Bargaining**: Authorities may negotiate with suspects by offering leniency or other incentives in exchange for information. However, this must be done within legal and ethical boundaries to ensure the suspect's rights are upheld.

6. **Witnesses and Third Parties**: Using information from witnesses or third parties can provide context or corroboration, which may lead the suspect to provide information voluntarily out of a desire to clear their name.

By employing these methods, law enforcement officials can aim to gather information ethically and legally without infringing on constitutional rights.
