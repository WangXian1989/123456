To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2024, plus a catch-up contribution for those over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is typically $6,500 (plus catch-up contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but capital gains can be taxed.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and future expectations.
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher-growth investments.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA could be beneficial to avoid taxes on future withdrawals.
   - For higher income years, prefer tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help align your strategy with your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for tax efficiency and growth potential.
