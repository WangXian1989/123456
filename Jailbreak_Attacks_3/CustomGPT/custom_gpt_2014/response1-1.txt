Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match. After that, consider maxing out your IRA if eligible.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deduction benefits depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and potential investment growth. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit from the tax shield.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will be taxed. For instance, withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains from taxable accounts may have lower tax rates.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust the asset allocation in your accounts to align with changing market conditions and personal financial situations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
