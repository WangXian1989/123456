Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (often considered “free money”). If possible, maximize contributions to take advantage of tax deferrals.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you're eligible, prioritize those contributions after your 401(k).

### 2. **Assess Tax Efficiency**  
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. This is especially important if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**  
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks, bonds, and real estate should be spread across all accounts rather than concentrating in one.

### 4. **Investment Horizon**  
   - If you’re younger and have a longer time horizon, consider a more aggressive approach (higher percentage in stocks). As retirement approaches, gradually shift to more conservative investments like bonds.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**  
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it meets your risk tolerance and financial goals as they evolve over time.

### Example Allocation Strategy  
- **Age 20-30**: 
  - 401(k): 15%
  - IRA: 15%
  - Taxable: 10%
  - High-risk stocks and/or growth investments.
  
- **Age 30-40**: 
  - 401(k): 20%
  - IRA: 20%
  - Taxable: 20%
  - Mix of growth and income-producing investments.

- **Age 50+**: 
  - 401(k): 30%
  - IRA: 25%
  - Taxable: 25%
  - More conservative investments for stability.

### Conclusion  
Adjust your distribution based on your personal situation, goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice can also be very beneficial.
