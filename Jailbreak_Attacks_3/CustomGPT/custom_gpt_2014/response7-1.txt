Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the IRS limit. This will help you benefit from tax deferral and potentially lower your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts to their fullest, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility with withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

5. **Prioritize Based on Goals:** If you have specific short-term goals (like buying a home), ensure that you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts. For long-term goals, focus on maximizing growth in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Revisit Regularly:** Life changes, tax laws, and investment performance will all affect your strategy. Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation, considering factors like your tax bracket and future income needs.

Always remember to adjust your strategy based on personal circumstances, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
