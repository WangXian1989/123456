To strategically distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on profits, but allow for more flexible withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals.
   - Higher growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to compounding and tax deferral.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Ensure you maximize employer matches in your 401(k) before contributing to IRAs.
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs in 2023).

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: After hitting the match, consider funding an IRA for additional tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that don’t provide tax advantages or for short-term savings, ensuring you’re mindful of tax implications.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% of total investment contributions (ensuring employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

Reevaluate your strategy periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
