1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can have significant benefits.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, specific medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, endoscopy, or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are essential to track the disease's progression and adjust treatment as needed.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for the best outcomes.
