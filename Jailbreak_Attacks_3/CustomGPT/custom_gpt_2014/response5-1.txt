Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have room in your budget, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, focus on taxable accounts. This can be useful for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, opt for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before investing heavily.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation annually and adjust based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
