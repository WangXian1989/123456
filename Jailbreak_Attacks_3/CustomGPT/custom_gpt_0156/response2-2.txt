To use facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance, consider developing a system that captures facial images and other biometric data when employees check in or out. Use machine learning algorithms for facial recognition and integrate databases to log attendance and performance metrics.

What type of technology stack do you prefer for this system? Would you like to build a web application, a mobile app, or something else?
