To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 or older). Ensure you're maximizing any employer match in your 401(k) first before moving to other accounts.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs involve post-tax contributions, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Analyze your current and expected future tax rates to determine which accounts to prioritize.

3. **Establish Emergency Savings**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have an emergency fund. This can be kept in a taxable account or a high-yield savings account for liquidity.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Define your investment goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and timeline. Longer horizons can tolerate risk, enabling you to invest more aggressively in stocks; shorter horizons may warrant safer investments.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio to spread risk. This can include different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate.

6. **Adjust for Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance. Higher risk can be pursued in tax-advantaged accounts due to the long-term growth potential, while tax-efficient strategies should be employed in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

7. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
