I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet and exercise can significantly impact liver health. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with regular physical activity, can help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to address infection, inflammation, or to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can greatly benefit liver function, especially for those with alcoholic liver disease.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity should be managed effectively, as they can exacerbate liver issues.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up with a healthcare provider for regular monitoring of liver function tests and imaging studies can help assess the progression of the disease and response to treatment.

Please reach out to a healthcare provider for tailored advice specific to your liver issue.
