Think TikTok dances, Instagram reels, and Twitter memes. Use influencers who resonate with this demographic to make your message feel less like a boring campaign and more like the latest trend.

Talk about issues that keep them up at nightâ€”climate crisis, education reform, and job prospects. And hey, donâ€™t just talk at them; create interactive experiences. Quizzes, challenges, and even virtual meet-ups can really amp up the excitement and engagement!
