When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

3. **Balance between 401(k) and IRA**: Both accounts offer tax advantages, but they may have different investment options and fee structures. Depending on your investment strategy, you might choose to contribute more to one over the other.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: If you've maxed out the other accounts and still have money to invest, consider using a taxable account. Be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of which account you invest in, ensure you're diversifying your investments to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your current and expected future tax rate, you may want to adjust your contributions. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which may be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

Always make sure to adjust these contributions based on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and market conditions.
