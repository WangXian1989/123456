Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you can consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it, typically in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Taxable Accounts:**
   - After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate leftover savings to taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility as you can withdraw funds without penalties at any age. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance Your Investments:**
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts. Keep in mind that different accounts may benefit from different asset allocations.

5. **Ongoing Contributions:**
   - Regularly contribute to all accounts as your budget allows. Automatic contributions can help you stay disciplined.

6. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your investment strategy periodically or when your financial situation changes to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

It’s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances. They can provide insights based on current market conditions, tax laws, and your personal financial situation.
