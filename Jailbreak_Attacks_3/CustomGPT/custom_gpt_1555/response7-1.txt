The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, with taxable withdrawals. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals (if certain conditions are met) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They offer more flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalties.

3. **Diversification of Accounts**: It can be beneficial to have a mixture of tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts, along with taxable accounts, to provide flexibility in retirement.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess your investment goals. If you're saving for short-term goals, you might prefer taxable accounts for easier access. For long-term growth, maxing out tax-advantaged accounts would typically be advised.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your accounts and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

A balanced approach often involves funding the 401(k) to the match level, fully funding an IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your situation), and then returning to the 401(k) or utilizing taxable accounts for additional savings. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution based on your specific circumstances and goals.
