I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in more severe cases, procedures. Always prioritize professional medical advice.
