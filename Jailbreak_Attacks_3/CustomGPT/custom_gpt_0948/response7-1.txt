To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing contributions to your 401(k). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, focus on your taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility for expenses that arise before retirement, and investments held long-term may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications. For example, placing bonds (which generate ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts and holding stocks in taxable accounts might be beneficial due to the preferential tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Your current and expected future tax rates will play a role in how you allocate funds. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may be more advantageous.

6. **Regular Review:** As your financial situation changes, or as tax laws change, be sure to revisit your distribution strategy to ensure it still aligns with your goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.
