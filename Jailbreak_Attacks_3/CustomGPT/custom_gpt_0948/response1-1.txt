The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to take advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA also offers tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don't have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before aggressively investing.

4. **Debt Management:** If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down before prioritizing investment accounts.

5. **Investment Goals:** Consider your timeline and risk tolerance. For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, or if you want flexibility, a taxable account might be more suitable.

6. **Diversification:** Within your accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regular Reviews:** Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
