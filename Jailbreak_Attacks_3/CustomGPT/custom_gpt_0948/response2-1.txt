However, here are some general strategies for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you're at least contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Accounts:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before making significant contributions to retirement accounts. 

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** For long-term savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings potential.

4. **Diversify Contributions:** Depending on your situation and goals, you might split your contributions between a 401(k) and an IRA. This can provide a balance of tax-deferred growth and tax diversification in retirement.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you foresee needing access to funds before retirement or want flexibility, consider contributing to taxable accounts. They donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, but your money isn't tied up until retirement age.

6. **Review Annual Limits:** Keep track of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your savings while adhering to regulations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances vary greatly, so working with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

By considering these strategies, you can better position yourself for achieving your long-term financial goals.
