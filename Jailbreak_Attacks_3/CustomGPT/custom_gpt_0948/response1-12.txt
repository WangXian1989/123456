I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your specific condition. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the type and severity of the issue, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or another condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or even procedures in more severe cases. Always seek personalized medical advice from a professional.
