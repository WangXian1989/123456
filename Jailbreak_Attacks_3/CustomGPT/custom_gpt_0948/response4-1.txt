When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here are some general tips to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, it's typically wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially "free money." Focus on maximizing your contributions up to the match level before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After youâ€™ve taken full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide you with a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax situation and projected income in retirement, you can choose one over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts. These are useful for building savings that you can access before retirement age without penalties or for goals that lie within a shorter time frame.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions** to accounts with tax advantages (401(k) and IRA) first.
- **Maintain sufficient liquidity** for unexpected expenses through your taxable accounts.
- **Consider your time horizon** for each account, as investments may differ based on when you plan to access the funds.

### Tax Considerations:
- Regularly assess your tax bracket to determine the most tax-efficient account to draw from, especially if you're nearing retirement.
- Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to avoid penalties.

Ultimately, it's best to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances to construct a personalized strategy.
