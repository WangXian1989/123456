When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate the benefits and restrictions of each account type. Here are some strategies to maximize your investment:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Growth:** Take advantage of pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize your tax impact.

### Recommended Allocation Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund your IRA contributions. After that, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts.
- **Periodic Review:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

By strategically structuring your contributions and considering the tax implications of each account type, you can work towards optimizing your retirement savings and investment growth.
