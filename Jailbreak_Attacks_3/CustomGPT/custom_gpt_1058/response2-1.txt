The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future projections.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and liquidity, allowing you to access your money without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes across all accounts to balance growth and risk.

5. **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Investment decisions in taxable accounts can lead to capital gains taxes, while account distributions from IRAs and 401(k)s are subject to income taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and adjust your portfolio allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain or want personalized guidance, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored plan.

Overall, your specific distribution should align with your short-term and long-term financial goals, so take the time to evaluate what works best for you.
