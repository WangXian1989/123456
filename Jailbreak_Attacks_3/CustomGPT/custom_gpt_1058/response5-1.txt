(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon until retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to maximize employer contributions to your 401(k), as this is essentially “free money.” After that, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you’re eligible for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth. Lastly, funds in taxable accounts can be used for more immediate needs or to maintain liquidity, but they come with different tax implications. It’s wise to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
