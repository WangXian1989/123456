When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your 401(k) contributions if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Ensure you are contributing enough to take full advantage of any match.

2. **IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. You can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice depends on your current tax situation and expected tax situation in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term gains or dividends. This can provide you with more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike the retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Decide on an asset allocation strategy that suits your risk tolerance and investment goals. Usually, it is beneficial to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each investment. For example, placing investments with high dividend yields in tax-advantaged accounts can help reduce the tax burden.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and investment strategy.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**: As you approach retirement, develop a strategy for withdrawing funds from each account type in a tax-efficient manner.

Overall, the best approach will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and current tax circumstances. It can also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
