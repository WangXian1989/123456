To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. For the 2023 tax year, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50) to IRAs. Evaluate whether a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions) is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 401(k) plans, the limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Strategically**: If you have reached your contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. In these, you can hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions. This also includes assessing your contributions based on any changes in your income or expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your individual circumstances, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. They can offer personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these tips, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your retirement savings. Always ensure your overall approach aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
