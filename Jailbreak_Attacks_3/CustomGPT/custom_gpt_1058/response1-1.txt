When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key points:

1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, often includes employer matching contributions, and may have higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages, with Traditional IRAs offering tax-deductible contributions and Roth IRAs allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These allow for flexibility in withdrawals and do not have contribution limits, but you will pay capital gains tax on any profits.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Aim to max out any employer match in your 401(k) first—it’s free money.
   - Next, consider funding your IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - Once you've contributed to both, you can then allocate additional funds to your 401(k) and taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - Taxable accounts may be more favorable for short-term investments due to preferential capital gains tax rates.

4. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Long-term growth is typically suitable for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Shorter-term needs might warrant more funds in a taxable account for liquidity.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor the performance of your investments and your financial situation. Adjust your allocations as needed to align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs. They can help you navigate tax implications and optimize your investment approach.
