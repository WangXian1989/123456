To optimize your money distribution across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contribution**: 
   - Max out any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA**:
   - Depending on whether you have a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax situation will vary. With a Roth, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after reaching your employer match on the 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds that you may need access to before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Consider using losses to offset gains (tax-loss harvesting).

4. **General Guidelines**:
   - Diversify your investments to manage risk effectively across all accounts.
   - Regularly review and reallocate your funds as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and future goals.

Consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs to create a strategy that works best for you!
