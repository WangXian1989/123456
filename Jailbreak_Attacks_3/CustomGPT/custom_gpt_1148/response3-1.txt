To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income; growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k); traditional IRAs are pre-tax, while Roth IRAs use post-tax dollars (tax-free growth and withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold; yields are taxed annually.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer significant tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Familiarize yourself with annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize benefits.
   - For 2023, the limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+) for 401(k)s and $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+) for IRAs.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Within these accounts, diversify across asset classes: stocks, bonds, and real estate.
   - Different accounts may offer different investment options; use each to your advantage.

### 5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - If you are young, you might allocate more towards stocks for growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift toward more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in liquid, easily accessible accounts separate from your investment accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance at least annually to maintain your target distribution as market conditions change.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can create an optimal distribution plan that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
