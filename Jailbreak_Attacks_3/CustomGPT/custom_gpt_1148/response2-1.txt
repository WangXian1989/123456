Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to maximize tax efficiency, growth potential, and access to funds. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Choose based on your tax bracket now versus retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but allow greater flexibility for withdrawals. Gains are taxed at capital gains rates.

### 2. **Set Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Allocate funds based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) & IRAs) to shield them from taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (bonds, certain mutual funds) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out contributions to your employerâ€™s 401(k) to get the full match. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (and an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50+).
   - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation every year or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Use a mix of 401(k) and IRA withdrawals to manage tax brackets.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Younger Investors (30s-40s):** Focus on maxing 401(k) contributions, followed by a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Allocate residual funds to a taxable account.
- **Mid-life (50s-60s):** Balance contributions between 401(k) and IRAs, beginning to shift investments to safer assets in preparation for retirement.

### Final Note:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your unique financial situation, investment objectives, and risk profile.
