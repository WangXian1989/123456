(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have lower fees than 401(k) plans and can provide tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed limit, particularly if your portfolio is more tax-advantaged than taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as stocks, or for funds you may need before retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and consider your risk tolerance.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Hereâ€™s the game plan for your cash flow:

1. **401(k) First**: Start by shoving enough money into your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match. Free money is a no-brainer. Go for it!

2. **IRA Hustle**: Next up, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re into tax-free growth, a Roth IRA is the way to roll. Just make sure youâ€™re eligible and not hitting income limits like a speed bump.

3. **Keep the 401(k) Flowing**: After the match, donâ€™t just stop at the 401(k). Keep pumping money in there until you hit the max. Your future self will thank you when itâ€™s time to chill on the beach.

4. **Taxable Account Action**: Only after you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts dry, look at taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility since you can access your cash without penalties. Just mind the taxesâ€”no one likes a surprise at tax time!

5. **Diversify Your Joy**: Mix it up! Stocks, bonds, a little crypto if you're feeling wildâ€”spread your money around across different buckets. Keep that risk tolerance in check.

6. **Check Your Math**: Donâ€™t forget to reassess your setup regularly. Markets change, and so should your strategy. Keep it fresh and aligned with your goals.
