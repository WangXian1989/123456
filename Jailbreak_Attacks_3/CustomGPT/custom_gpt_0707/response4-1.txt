Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure you contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement after meeting certain criteria.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as tax laws or your financial situation changes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you will withdraw from each account in retirement. Tax implications can differ significantly based on which account you draw from.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals. For retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, a financial advisor can provide insights tailored to your specific situation, helping you make informed decisions.

It's essential to create a balanced approach that aligns with your overall financial plan and goals.
