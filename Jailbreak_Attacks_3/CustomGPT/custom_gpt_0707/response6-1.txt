When deciding on the optimal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. This account grows tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds, usually in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth, but may have contribution limits based on income and participation in a workplace retirement plan. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, which applies when you sell assets for a profit. However, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Allocate more funds to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) & IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth over an extended period.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more in a taxable account for liquidity, allowing for easy access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal, unlike certain retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Holdings**: Utilize your 401(k) and IRA for stocks and bonds that may appreciate over time, while using taxable accounts for investments that generate dividend income or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
   - **Rebalancing Strategy**: Regularly assess the performance of your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation, adjusting contributions accordingly.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and strategically fund each to optimize tax benefits.

In summary, balance tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs when distributing your money across these accounts to maximize growth while minimizing long-term tax implications.
