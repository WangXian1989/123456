When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Take full advantage of any employer match; itâ€™s free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for flexible access to funds and investments not restricted by retirement account rules.
   - Consider holding investments with lower tax implications (like index funds or ETFs) for better after-tax returns.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Align your investment choices with your financial goals. Short-term goals might benefit from safer, more liquid investments, while long-term goals can tolerate more volatility.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when making decisions. It's important to balance growth potential with safety.
