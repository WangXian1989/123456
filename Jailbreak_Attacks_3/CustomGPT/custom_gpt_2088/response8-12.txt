I'm not a doctor, but for liver health issues, treatment often depends on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet changes, such as reducing alcohol intake and avoiding processed foods, can be beneficial.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
