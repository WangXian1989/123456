3. **Voter Accessibility Initiatives**:
   - **Easy Registration**: Promote online voter registration and provide information on deadlines and procedures.
   - **Transportation and Accessibility**: Offer solutions for getting to polling places, especially in underserved areas.

4. **Interactive Campaigning**:
