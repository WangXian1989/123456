Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefits as 401(k) but has a different contribution limit and rules for withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments can incur taxes on dividends and capital gains, so consider the timing of asset sales and dividend distributions.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account. Consider the tax efficiency of each asset type; for example, hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings before aggressively funding retirement accounts. This can prevent you from needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

### 5. **Long-term Goals:**
   - If your goal is retirement, prioritize 401(k) and IRAs. If you have shorter-term goals (like buying a house), consider focusing more on taxable accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially to get the employer match.
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** Contribute as much as you can after maxing your 401(k), especially if there's tax diversification potential.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After contributing to retirement accounts, invest any additional funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review:
Review your contributions and allocations regularly to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
