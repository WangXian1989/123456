Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access. These can be useful for short-term goals and can hold investments like stocks or ETFs, which may have favorable tax treatment (lower long-term capital gains rates).

### 4. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and adjust your asset allocation accordingly in each account type.

### 5. **Account Types for Different Goals**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term savings or specific goals (like buying a house or travel).

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement, considering tax implications. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 7. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your funds across different investment accounts.
