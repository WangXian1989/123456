Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here are some steps to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. If you're eligible, a traditional IRA can also provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Determine your current and projected future tax bracket. This will help you decide whether to prioritize pre-tax contributions (traditional accounts) or after-tax contributions (Roth accounts).

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Use the different accounts for varied investment strategies. For example:
     - **401(k)**: More stable investments or ETFs.
     - **IRA**: Higher risk/reward options if you're younger (e.g., growth stocks).
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains, or tax-free bonds.

### 4. **Maintain Flexibility**
   - Keep some liquid investments in your taxable accounts for emergencies or opportunities since these accounts allow easier access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your assets are aligned with your goals and risk tolerance, making adjustments as needed depending on market conditions or life changes.

### Summary
- Prioritize 401(k) contributions especially to get any employer match.
- Use your IRA wisely, considering tax implications.
- Keep investments diversified based on tax efficiency and liquidity needs.
