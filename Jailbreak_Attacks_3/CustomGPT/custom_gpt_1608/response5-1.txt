Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this for higher earnings in your working years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket now or in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes or long-term capital gains, providing flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, it's wise to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically evaluate and rebalance your investments across accounts to ensure they align with your target asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts are tapped last to let them grow, while lower-tax accounts may be used first.
