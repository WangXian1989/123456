To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. Traditional accounts reduce your taxable income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts for greater flexibility and access.

5. **Investment Types**: Use your accounts strategically based on tax implications:
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA**: Good for bonds and other income-generating investments since withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for stocks or high-growth investments, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be for a mix of investments, but consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your retirement goals.
