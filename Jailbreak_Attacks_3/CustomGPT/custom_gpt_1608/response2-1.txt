To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching. Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax situation, choose between traditional or Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you don’t get tax advantages here, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and you can invest in a broader range of assets.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep fixed income (e.g., bonds) and higher-yielding sensitive assets in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for liquidity.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to spread risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll draw funds in retirement. Consider tax implications of withdrawing from each account type.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Review your allocation periodically to align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changes in tax laws.

A typical strategy might involve maxing out 401(k) contributions to get any employer match, fully funding an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible), and then placing additional savings into a taxable account. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances.
