Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timelines. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Often provides employer matching, which is essentially free money. Maximize this first.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (with a Roth IRA). Contribute as much as allowed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While not tax-advantaged, they offer flexibility without penalties on withdrawals.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid assets before investing heavily.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and long-term goals, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., for 401(k) and IRA). Aim to maximize contributions to the accounts offering the best tax benefits first.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Financial Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.

This approach balances the benefits of each account type while ensuring you’re prepared for retirement and other financial goals.
