I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional about liver problems, as they can provide tailored advice based on your specific condition. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and, in more serious cases, procedures or surgeries. It's crucial to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a qualified healthcare provider for accurate guidance.
