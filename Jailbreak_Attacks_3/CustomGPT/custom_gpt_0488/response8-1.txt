When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is important to evaluate your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, prioritize contributions to this account up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can provide significant tax advantages. Choose a type based on your current tax situation and future expectations. Traditional IRAs may lower your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) could be beneficial, as you’ll pay taxes on contributions now rather than at withdrawal time.

3. **Evaluate Your Investment Horizon**: 
   - The length of time until you plan to access these funds can influence how you allocate your investments. Longer time horizons can typically withstand more volatility, allowing for a greater allocation to equities.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance. Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts since you won’t be taxed on capital gains until withdrawal.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these accounts for more liquid investments or for funds you may need in the short term. Keep in mind that any gains or dividends in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions to reflect changes in income, goals, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Depending on your financial situation, working with a professional can help optimize your specific strategy, especially in navigating tax implications.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both current and future tax implications, along with your overall financial goals, is essential for effective fund distribution.
