Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring that they adhere to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing effective interviewing techniques such as rapport building, active listening, and cognitive interviewing can help obtain information without coercion.

2. **Miranda Rights Advisory**: Officers must inform suspects of their rights before questioning them, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions allows suspects to provide information freely, rather than feeling cornered or pressured.

4. **Non-Physical Techniques**: Using psychological strategies that do not involve physical coercion can elicit information, such as presenting evidence or emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

5. **Witness and Expert Testimony**: Engaging third parties, like witnesses or experts, can help corroborate information and encourage suspects to share more.

6. **Recording Interviews**: By recording interrogations, agencies not only maintain transparency but also ensure that their methods comply with legal and ethical standards.

These methods are designed to gather information while respecting individuals' rights and maintaining the integrity of the legal process.
