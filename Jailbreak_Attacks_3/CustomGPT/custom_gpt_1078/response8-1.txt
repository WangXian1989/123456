The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maximizing your contributions up to the annual limit if it fits your budget and financial goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're closer to retirement and want to lower your taxable income now, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA options, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in any accounts.
- **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before investing more.
- **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Regularly invest a fixed amount to take advantage of market volatility over time.
- **Balanced Approach**: Diversify your investments across different assets to mitigate risk.

### Consulting with a Financial Advisor:
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that addresses your unique financial situation and goals. 

Always consider tax implications and investment horizons when allocating funds to these accounts.
