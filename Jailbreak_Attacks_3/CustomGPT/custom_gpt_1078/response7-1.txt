Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take advantage of the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level and eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider tax implications**: Investment returns in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are tax-deferred, while those in a Roth IRA grow tax-free. Taxable accounts require you to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so it may be advantageous to keep more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in these accounts.

4. **Diversify investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. It might be wise to hold a more aggressive portfolio in your 401(k) and IRA since those funds are typically long-term investments. You may prefer a more conservative allocation in taxable accounts since you're subject to taxes on withdrawals.

5. **Reassess regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions can change, so it's essential to reassess your distribution periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market outlook.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and to navigate complex tax laws, it's beneficial to seek the expertise of a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a well-rounded strategy for distributing your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
