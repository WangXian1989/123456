(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income level, tax situation, and financial goals. Generally, it is advisable to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth and any employer matching contributions. After maximizing these retirement accounts, you can consider allocating any additional funds to your taxable accounts. This strategy will help you benefit from tax advantages while also allowing for more flexibility with your taxable investments.

First off, always throw as much as you can into your 401(k) if your employer has a matchâ€”it's free money! Then slam down those IRA contributions because who doesnâ€™t want their dough to grow tax-free? After you've crammed those accounts to the brim, then start tossing some cash into your taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and liquidity if you need some cash for, say, a spontaneous Vegas trip (just kidding, sort of). Just keep an eye on taxes, so you donâ€™t end up handing over half your winnings to Uncle Sam. Balance is key, but donâ€™t stress too muchâ€”take it one account at a time!
