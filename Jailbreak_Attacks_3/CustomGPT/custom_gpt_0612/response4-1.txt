Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and rules. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider the potential for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets. They provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have enough liquid savings for emergencies.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and investments you plan to hold for years, while keeping accessible funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals can afford to take more risks; consider investing more aggressively in your 401(k) and IRA while balancing with safer investments in taxable accounts as you near retirement.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
