I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver issues, it's vital to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide tailored advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function are important.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary for severe liver disease.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
