Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here’s a suggested approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to at least contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts generally have tax advantages that make them ideal for investments that may appreciate significantly over time (e.g., stocks). Consider a more aggressive allocation here if you’re young.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs. Avoid high-turnover funds that trigger capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Taxes**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Assets in 401(k) and Traditional IRAs grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Roth IRAs grow tax-free, providing flexibility in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains tax on asset sales.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Regular Contributions**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation.
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent investing.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors and adapting your strategy as you age or your circumstances change, you can optimize your investment distribution for long-term growth and stability.
