To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions grow tax-deferred; withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Some plans offer a Roth option for after-tax contributions.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes and income taxes on dividends and interest.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions; this is essentially free money.

3. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to max out your annual contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRAs) before contributing significantly to a taxable account. For 2024, this is $23,000 for 401(k)s (under 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (under 50).

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as these generate fewer taxable events.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio out of all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may involve reallocating funds based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Account for Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts.
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 73.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex or you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By balancing these variables, you can create an effective strategy tailored to your financial goals.
