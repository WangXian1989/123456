Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, invest in an IRA or Roth IRA to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deductible contributions (traditional IRA).

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs if possible, as this will provide the most significant long-term tax advantages.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account.
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for mid-term goals.

### 4. **Diversification Within Accounts:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, adjusting for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Strategize your withdrawal plan in retirement to minimize taxes, considering the order in which to draw from these accounts.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, each personâ€™s situation is unique, so it may be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and goals.
