Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. **Understanding Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, then consider maxing out contributions (for 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50).
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize contributions (for 2024, the limit is $6,500 under 50). You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) and a Roth IRA (tax-free in retirement), depending on your income and tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement without penalties. Focus here on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

### 2. **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
     - Start with the 401(k) to get the full employer match.
     - Next, max out your IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**:
     - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts for liquid investments or short-term goals.

### 3. **Considerations for Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, consider how much to allocate to stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account.
   - **Tax Implications**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your financial goals and market conditions. Consider rebalancing your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts, while also considering liquidity and flexibility, will help you optimize your wealth growth. If you have specific goals in mind (retirement age, specific purchases), tailoring your strategy to those objectives will yield the best results.
