Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Warnings:** Informing suspects of their rights under the Fifth Amendment before an interrogation to ensure they understand their right to remain silent and to an attorney.

2. **Building Rapport:** Employing psychological techniques to create a trusting relationship with the suspect, making them more comfortable sharing information.

3. **Open-Ended Questions:** Asking non-threatening, open-ended questions to encourage suspects to talk freely rather than leading questions that might coerce a specific answer.

4. **Voluntary Interviews:** Conducting interviews in a non-coercive manner and ensuring that the suspect can leave or refuse to answer questions at any time.

5. **Record Keeping:** Documenting all interactions to maintain transparency and accountability, which helps protect both the rights of the suspect and the integrity of the investigation.

These methods focus on aligning with legal standards and ensuring suspects' rights are protected throughout the investigative process.
