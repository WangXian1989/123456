When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Keep more stable or income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), IRA) and taxable assets allows for strategic withdrawals to manage your tax burden.

4. **Monitoring and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly review your account performance and asset allocation. Adjust contributions based on changes in tax laws, retirement goals, and market conditions.
