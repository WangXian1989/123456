Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for the tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so they may be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free if qualified. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals and provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Different accounts may house different types of investments based on tax implications. For example, it might be wise to hold high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and keep bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts where the tax burden can be managed.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Continually assess your asset allocation as markets change and your financial situation evolves. 

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexity of tax and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.

By considering these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both tax efficiency and growth potential.
