To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For a 401(k), this often includes employer matching, which is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRAs**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible now, taxed later) and a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free growth). Your choice may depend on your current tax rate compared to your expected tax rate in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Keep Emergency Funds**: Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts to cover emergencies without incurring penalties associated with withdrawing from retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate assets based on how long you have until retirement and your comfort with risk. Higher-risk investments might be appropriate in your 401(k) and IRA, while more stable investments could be suitable for taxable accounts.

4. **Regular Re-evaluation**: 
   - **Adjust Contributions as Needed**: Regularly reassess your contributions and account balances to ensure they align with your long-term financial goals and market conditions.

Balancing contributions this way can help maximize your investments while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
