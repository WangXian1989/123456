Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Assess Tax Benefits**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for Traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax; focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Pay attention to the fees associated with your 401(k) and IRA. High fees can erode your investment returns over time.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how youâ€™ll withdraw funds. Consider tax implications and ensure you have a strategy to minimize taxes during retirement.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances.
