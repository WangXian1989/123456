Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if possible, up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you prefer a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Different accounts can hold different types of investments; for instance, high-growth stocks may be better suited for a Roth IRA due to tax-free growth, while bonds could be more appropriate for taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - Taxable accounts incur taxes on dividends and capital gains each year, while 401(k)s and IRAs benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth. Keep investments that generate higher tax liabilities in tax-advantaged accounts when possible.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you’ll withdraw funds. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and financial goals. Adjust contributions to each account based on changes in income, market conditions, and your retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on the complexity of your financial situation, professional advice may provide tailored strategies and insights that align with your long-term goals.

By considering these strategies, you can effectively allocate your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your long-term financial health.
