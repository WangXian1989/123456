1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet (low in fats and sugars, high in fruits and vegetables).
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Medications to control liver inflammation.
   - Supplements like vitamin E might be recommended for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Routine Check-ups**: 
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor your condition.
   - Imaging tests, such as ultrasounds, to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, like cirrhosis, liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Discuss with your healthcare provider about herbal supplements or alternative treatments that may support liver health.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment option based on your specific liver condition and overall health.
