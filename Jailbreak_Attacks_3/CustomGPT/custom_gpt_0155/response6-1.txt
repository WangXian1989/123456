To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, consider a traditional IRA.

### 2. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Distribute investments based on risk tolerance across stocks, bonds, and cash alternatives in each account.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Maintain your desired asset allocation by periodically adjusting your investments based on performance.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - **Tax Implications:** Withdraw funds from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Consider Timing:** Be aware of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 73.

### 4. **Investment Focus:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Hold lower-turnover, tax-efficient investments (like ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - **High-Growth Investments:** Consider placing higher-growth, potentially higher-tax assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Long-Term Considerations:**
   - **Review Contribution Limits:** Stay within annual contribution limits for each account type.
   - **Planning for Retirement:** Tailor distributions based on when you plan to retire and expected income needs.

### Conclusion
Establishing a balanced approach with attention to tax implications and retirement goals can optimize your investment strategy across all account types.
