Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, contribute enough to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or stocks held for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified portfolio across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds, considering tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden.

A personalized approach, possibly with the help of a financial advisor, can further refine your strategy based on your circumstances.
