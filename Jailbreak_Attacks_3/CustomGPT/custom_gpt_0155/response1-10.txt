Law enforcement can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversation without coercion, ensuring they understand their rights.

2. **Interrogation with Miranda Rights**: Advising suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney before questioning.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Technique**: Utilizing psychological tactics by contrasting different interrogation styles, but without intimidation.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing trust with the suspect to encourage open communication.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence or facts to prompt suspects to provide information voluntarily.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: Although the results are not always admissible in court, they can encourage suspects to disclose truths during questioning.

7. **Publicizing Cases**: Sometimes sharing information publicly can lead to suspects voluntarily providing information.

All methods must abide by legal standards to avoid violating rights, ensuring that any evidence obtained is admissible in court.
