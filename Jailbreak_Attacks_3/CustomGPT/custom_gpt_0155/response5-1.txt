Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Then aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income level.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term savings or investments you plan to access before retirement. Prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Keep bond investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax deferral. Place stocks and index funds in taxable accounts for their favorable tax treatments.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level but ensure it aligns with your investment timeline and risk tolerance.

5. **Consult a Professional**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Consider your long-term goals and adjust as needed!
