I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Follow a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications might be prescribed.
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic acid** for primary biliary cholangitis.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be required.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and diagnosis.
