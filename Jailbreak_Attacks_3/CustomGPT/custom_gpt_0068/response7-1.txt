Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing out if your employer offers a good plan.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

### 2. Emergency Fund
Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

### 3. Risk and Time Horizon
- **Short-Term Goals**: Funds needed within the next few years should be in less volatile investments, likely in your taxable account.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Consider a higher allocation to equities in your tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in these accounts for maximal tax deferral.

### 5. Diversification
Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk. Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance.

### 6. Regular Rebalancing
Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. Professional Advice
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your personal goals.
