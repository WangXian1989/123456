To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Leverage higher contribution limits compared to IRA.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, ideal if you expect higher taxes in the future.
   - **Set Contribution Goals**: Aim to maximize your annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or investments you might need to access before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Investment Goals**: Align contributions with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment mix across all accounts.
   - **Review Regularly**: Reassess and adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial needs.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
