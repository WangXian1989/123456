To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - After maximizing the match in your 401(k), contribute to your IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investing after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse mix of investments across all accounts. Aim for a balance aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

This approach allows for tax efficiency while taking full advantage of retirement accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
