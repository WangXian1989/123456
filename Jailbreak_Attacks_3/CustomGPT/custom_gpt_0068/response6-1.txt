To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA as these provide tax benefits.
- **Utilize Roth accounts if eligible**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. Diversification
- **Diversify investments across accounts**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.
- **Consider asset location**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. Contribution Limits
- **Know your limits**: Ensure contributions donâ€™t exceed IRS limits for each account type.
- **Prioritize employer match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, ensure you meet that threshold.

### 4. Withdrawal Flexibility
- **Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts**: Ensure you have sufficient funds available for short-term needs without penalties.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency.
