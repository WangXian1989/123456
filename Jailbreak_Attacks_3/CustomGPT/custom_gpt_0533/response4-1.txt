To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a few key factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them at a profit. Interest and dividends are also taxable in the year they are earned.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - Ensure you're maximizing employer matches in your 401(k) first, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your investment goals and how long you plan to keep the money invested. If you're investing for retirement that's decades away, you may want to take more risks in your 401(k) or IRA.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible for short-term goals but may require more attention to tax efficiency.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Certain investments may be more tax-efficient in different types of accounts. For instance, high-growth investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) might fit better in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Approach:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially to obtain any employer match.
2. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, particularly if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
3. Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments focusing on growth, and using tax-efficient funds if possible.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific circumstances.
