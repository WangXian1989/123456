Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Build an Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a separate, easily accessible account.

3. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for additional flexibility and investment choices.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Generally, younger investors can afford a more aggressive allocation (more stocks), while those closer to retirement might prefer a conservative approach (more bonds).

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Hold higher-tax investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
