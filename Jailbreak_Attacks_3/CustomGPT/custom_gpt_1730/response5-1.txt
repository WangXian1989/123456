(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors: your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Max out employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This is ideal for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

Diversification is also crucial; ensure you're balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
