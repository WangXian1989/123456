To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offered by employers; benefits include pre-tax contributions and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals anytime.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) if eligible, as they provide excellent tax benefits.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers more limited investment choices. Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **IRA:** Allows for a broader range of investment options, including ETFs and mutual funds. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).
   - **Taxable Account:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Understand withdrawal rules and penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term (10+ years):** Higher allocation to stocks in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Medium-Term (5-10 years):** Mix moderate risk investments in your taxable accounts.
   - **Short-Term (<5 years):** Focus on safer investment options (like bonds or cash) across all accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation.

Following these strategies can help you create a balanced, tax-efficient plan for your retirement savings and investments.
