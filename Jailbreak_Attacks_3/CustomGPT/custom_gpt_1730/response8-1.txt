Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match offered. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, as they have tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Best for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments that may have higher tax implications when sold (e.g., stocks).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax liabilities (e.g., municipal bonds or investments held long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investment spreads risk across different asset classes in all accounts for optimal growth.

5. **Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
