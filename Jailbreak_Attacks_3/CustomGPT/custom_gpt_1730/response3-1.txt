The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing out this account if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you can, contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that donâ€™t fit well in tax-advantaged accounts, like certain ETFs or stocks, as they may produce long-term capital gains taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risks effectively.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications to minimize overall tax burden.
