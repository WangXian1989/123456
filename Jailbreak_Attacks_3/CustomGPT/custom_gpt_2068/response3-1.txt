Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth). This provides tax advantages that can enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Depending on your income, a traditional 401(k) can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds left over after maxing out your retirement accounts and employer match, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and more flexibility.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Revisit your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
