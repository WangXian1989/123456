Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits:** Consider maximizing contributions, as 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you contribute up to the limit if possible; this can be beneficial for long-term growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for goals outside retirement (e.g., buying a home).
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund:** Prioritize building an emergency fund, separate from these accounts.
2. **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
3. **Diversification:** Diversify investments across accounts to manage risk effectively.
4. **Rebalance:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your situation.
