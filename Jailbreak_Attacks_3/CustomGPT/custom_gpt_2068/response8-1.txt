Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or where you need access to funds without penalties. 

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on gains. Put income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they can often be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations according to market performance and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Contributions Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings strategy.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances. 

This multi-faceted approach can help you maximize your investment potential while managing taxes effectively.
