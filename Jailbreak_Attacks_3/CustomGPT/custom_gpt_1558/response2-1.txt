Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for potential tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and to cover short-term goals.

Adjust the percentages based on your needs and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
