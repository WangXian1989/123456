Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some steps to help guide your decisions:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine what you are saving for (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and the time frame for each goal.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; contributions can lower taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax benefits differ; Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and liquidity, but subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. Following that, consider maxing out an IRA if eligible.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Consider Withdrawals and Taxes**: Understand potential tax implications for withdrawals from each type of account, especially if you plan to access funds before retirement.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust based on changing goals or market conditions.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
