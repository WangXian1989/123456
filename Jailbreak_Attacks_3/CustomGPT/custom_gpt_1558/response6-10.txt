Law enforcement officials can utilize several techniques to gather information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some methods:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship can lead to voluntary disclosures.
  
2. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages the suspect to recall details by creating a relaxed environment and using open-ended questions.

3. **Evidence Presentation**: Presenting evidence can inspire suspects to cooperate without coercion.
