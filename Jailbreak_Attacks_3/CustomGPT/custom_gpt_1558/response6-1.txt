To optimize your money distribution across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free in retirement) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in lower-turnover strategies or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free, while keeping bond investments in taxable accounts to leverage lower tax rates.
