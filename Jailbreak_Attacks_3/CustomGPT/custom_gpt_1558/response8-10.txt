Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment encourages suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Clearly informing suspects of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona to maintain transparency.

3. **Non-coercive Interrogation**: Using non-threatening, non-physical questioning techniques to gather information without intimidation.

4. **Psychological Approaches**: Applying psychological strategies, such as strategic questioning or providing choice, can help elicit information while respecting the suspect's rights.

5. **Truthful Statements**: Presenting accurate information regarding the investigation to encourage cooperation without deception.

6. **Legal Counsel**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their right to have legal representation during questioning can lead to more candid conversations.

Each of these methods prioritizes constitutional rights while seeking truthful information.
