To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing to your 401(k) to maximize that benefit.
   - **IRA**: After securing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may lower your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use any additional funds for taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and immediate access to your funds, although youâ€™ll need to pay capital gains taxes on any investment gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Understand that dividends and capital gains will be taxed in the year they are realized.

6. **Account Types for Different Investments**: 
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Consider holding more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
