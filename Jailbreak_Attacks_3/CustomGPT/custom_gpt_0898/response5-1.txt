Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider how much further you want to contribute to your 401(k). The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, which can be beneficial.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current tax rate versus what you expect in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can focus on taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, though they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consideration of Asset Allocation**: Think about how you want to allocate your investments across these accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance, investment time horizon, and tax implications. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to hold bonds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investments to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
