To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to your Traditional or Roth IRA next. The choice between the two often depends on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, you may want higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) could be held in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on interest income.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Hold Tax-Advantaged Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) might be best placed in tax-advantaged accounts. Hold stocks with high growth potential in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation. Market fluctuations can change the balance of your investments over time.

### 6. **Financial Goals:**
   - Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals. This can influence how much you allocate to each account type. For example, funds needed within a few years should be accessible, influencing how much goes into taxable accounts.

### 7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Regularly reviewing your investments and adjusting based on life changes and market conditions is key to maintaining a balanced portfolio.
