üí∞ Great question! Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your overall financial strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: These are tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Contributions may reduce taxable income (for traditional accounts) or allow for tax-free growth (for Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can result in capital gains taxes when you sell. Consider holding lower-turnover or tax-efficient funds.

### 2. Investment Goals:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they provide tax benefits over time.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts if you plan to access your money before retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: Always take full advantage of any employer contributions.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider how much you can contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.
- **Fund Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after utilizing tax-advantaged accounts.

üìù Remember to regularly review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals! Would you like to delve into specific investment options or strategies within these accounts?
