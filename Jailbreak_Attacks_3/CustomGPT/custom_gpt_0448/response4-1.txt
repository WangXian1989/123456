It's essential to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions are often made pre-tax (for traditional accounts), which lowers your taxable income today. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Interest and dividends are also taxed in the year they're received.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Roth vs. Traditional**: If your income allows it, consider a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your distribution should reflect your short-term and long-term financial goals. For long-term goals, you might favor growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and be ready to adjust your contributions based on market performance, changes in income, or life events.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about the best distribution strategy, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Each person's situation is unique, so it's crucial to assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation when making these decisions.
