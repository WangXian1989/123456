Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your retirement savings and tax strategy. Here are some general principles to consider when deciding how to allocate your contributions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: These accounts often offer pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if age 50 or older). 
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contributing to a traditional IRA can also provide tax deductions. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, opt for this to enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Current and Future Tax Situations**: 
   - If you currently expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be advantageous. If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth account.
   - Taxable accounts donâ€™t provide upfront tax benefits, but you can control when to realize gains or losses, providing some flexibility.

4. **Emergency Fund and Immediate Needs**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This fund should cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Before making your investments, ensure that your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio regularly, as asset performance may skew your desired allocations. Rebalancing helps maintain your intended risk level.

In summary, a common approach is to first contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match, then maximize your IRA contributions, and finally, use any additional funds for taxable accounts or further investments.
