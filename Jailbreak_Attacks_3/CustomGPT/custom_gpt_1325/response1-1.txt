Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute the maximum ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if age 50 or older) if you can. These contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA (maximum contributions of $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if age 50 or older). Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This is especially useful if you expect to need access to funds before retirement age or if you want to invest in assets not allowed in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts may generate capital gains tax, whereas gains in a 401(k) or IRA aren’t taxed until withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
