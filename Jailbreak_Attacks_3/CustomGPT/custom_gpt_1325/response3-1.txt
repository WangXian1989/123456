The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction when contributing.

2. **Prioritize Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over age 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Consider using taxable accounts for investments meant for short-term goals or to manage your tax liability.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Different accounts can have varying investment strategies. For example, you might hold more aggressive investments in a 401(k) or IRA, where you won’t need to access the funds for years, while keeping more conservative investments in a taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - As your investments grow and market conditions change, it’s important to periodically rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors may take on more risk with a greater proportion in stocks, while those closer to retirement might want to shift towards bonds or more stable investments.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs and financial situation.
