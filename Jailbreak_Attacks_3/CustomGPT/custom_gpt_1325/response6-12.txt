The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Here are some common liver conditions and their treatment options:

1. **Fatty Liver Disease (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease)**:
   - **Lifestyle Changes**: Weight loss, increased physical activity, and a healthy diet (rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein).
   - **Medications**: In some cases, medications may be prescribed to control related conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol.

2. **Hepatitis (A, B, C)**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For hepatitis B and C, antiviral medications can help manage the infection and reduce liver damage.
   - **Vaccination**: Hepatitis A and B can often be prevented through vaccination.

3. **Liver Cirrhosis**:
   - **Addressing Underlying Causes**: Stopping alcohol intake, managing hepatitis, or eliminating factors that contribute to liver damage.
   - **Medications**: To manage symptoms or complications, such as diuretics for fluid retention or medications to control portal hypertension.

4. **Liver Tumors**:
   - **Surgery**: If the tumor is resectable, surgical removal may be an option.
   - **Ablation Therapy**: Techniques like radiofrequency ablation can destroy cancer cells.
   - **Chemotherapy or Targeted Therapy**: Used for specific types of liver cancer.

5. **Liver Transplant**:
   - For end-stage liver disease or severe liver dysfunction, a transplant may be the only option.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a precise diagnosis and tailored treatment plan based on the specific liver condition and individual health status. Regular monitoring and follow-ups are also crucial for managing liver health effectively.
