To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA for tax benefits.
2. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments with favorable tax treatments, such as long-term capital gains, or for higher-yield investments. 

Balance your risk tolerance and investment goals when selecting asset allocation within each account type.
