Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds beyond what can be efficiently saved in tax-advantaged accounts. This is where you’ll pay capital gains taxes, so prioritize tax-advantaged savings first.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation based on how much risk you are comfortable with.
- **Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments should be.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts for balanced risk.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions** (especially the match).
2. **Contribute to IRAs** up to the limit.
3. **Invest surplus funds in taxable accounts**.
