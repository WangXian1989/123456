I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet and exercise can significantly help. Eating a balanced diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up tests to monitor liver function can be important.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplants may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative treatments, though these should be discussed with a healthcare professional first.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
