I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may include a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications might include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and detect any progression of the disease early.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is drastically impaired, a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can help alleviate liver problems.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
