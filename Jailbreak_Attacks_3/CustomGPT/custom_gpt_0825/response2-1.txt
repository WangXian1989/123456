To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Make sure these investments are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified mix of assets within each account type, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
