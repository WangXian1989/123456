Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation. Keep in mind the contribution limits and potential tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for shorter-term goals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy includes a diversified mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**: Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement. Contributing to a Roth IRA might be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your distribution strategy to adjust for changes in your income, life circumstances, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
