Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Here is a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on maxing out this account if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met). Decide based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax advantages (like real estate or certain bonds). They are more flexible for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and asset allocation strategy. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be better suited in tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, carefully plan how and when to withdraw from each account. Consider tax implications on withdrawals, especially from your 401(k) and traditional IRA.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to remain aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and personal finance, itâ€™s often beneficial to speak with a professional who can tailor advice to your situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary between individuals. Consider your unique circumstances and goals before making a decision.
