Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get that full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement. It's beneficial for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but again, taxes are due at withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are taxed in the year they are realized. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals and may have capital gains advantages.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risk.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: If you think you’ll need access to funds before retirement, consider keeping more funds in taxable accounts since they don’t have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Investment Growth Potential**: Typically, you might want to hold higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRAs) to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Review your overall financial plan, and consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique situation, goals, and needs.

Maintaining a balanced approach aligned with your financial objectives and risk tolerance is crucial. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your situation changes!
