To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (taxed upfront, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested funds are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed in the year received, but they offer more flexibility in withdrawal.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a strong foundational step.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After hitting the 401(k) match, maximize your IRA contributions next, particularly if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth.
   - If eligible and benefits outweigh the costs, consider a Health Savings Account (HSA) for triple tax advantages.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Keep an eye on your current tax bracket and future tax expectations. If you believe you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, leaning towards a Roth IRA might be wise.

5. **Diversify Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shelter them from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed, considering changes in contribution levels, market performance, and tax implications.

7. **Long-Term Planning**: Consider your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and when you'll need to access the funds. Having a diverse mix across accounts can provide flexibility.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: If complexity arises in your financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized strategies aligned with your goals.

By distributing your money thoughtfully across these accounts, you'll better position yourself for financial stability and growth both now and in retirement.
