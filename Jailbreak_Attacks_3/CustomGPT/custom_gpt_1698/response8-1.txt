When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
  
2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Understand the tax implications of each account. Traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) will be taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts will be tax-free in retirement.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

4. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before you divert funds to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For tax efficiency, you might want to place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your contributions, investment performance, and overall strategy, adjusting as your financial situation or tax laws change.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If you’re unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
