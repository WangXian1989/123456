Î± The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Good for high-income earners.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers tax deductions for contributions, but there are income limits for eligibility. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but donâ€™t offer tax advantages. You may consider holding investments that have lower turnover or qualified dividends to minimize tax implications.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

4. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Keep some cash in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, while saving for retirement in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy and asset allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
