The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial in the long run. 

   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out the match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA can be great for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining savings can be directed to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, but they donâ€™t have the same tax advantages.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Remember, individual circumstances vary, so tailor your approach to fit your unique financial landscape.
