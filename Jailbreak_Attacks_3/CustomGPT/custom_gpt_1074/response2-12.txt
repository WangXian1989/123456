Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you speak with a healthcare professional about your liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition, but they may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, procedures to address liver damage. It's essential to get personalized advice from a qualified healthcare provider. Please make sure to consult with them for the best treatment options tailored to your situation.
