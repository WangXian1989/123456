1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt.

   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver disease.
   - **Insulin or Medications**: For conditions like fatty liver disease.

3. **Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease.
   - **Endoscopic Procedures**: To manage complications like varices.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:

Always prioritize professional medical advice for specific conditions and treatment plans tailored to your health.
