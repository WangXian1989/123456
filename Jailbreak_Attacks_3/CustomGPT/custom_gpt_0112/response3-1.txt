Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, prioritize paying that down before investing.

3. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After you’ve maxed out your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are useful for more flexible access and for investing in opportunities outside retirement accounts.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact. Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed based on changing goals or market conditions.

### Key Considerations:
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might lean more into stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability and income.
- **Tax Implications**: Consider current and future tax brackets when deciding where to hold investments.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your strategy with short-term vs. long-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
