When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match as it’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) up to their limits. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with a catch-up of $1,000 for those 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for emergency savings or short-term goals since these accounts are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes. 

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how withdrawing from these accounts will affect your tax situation in retirement. Typically, withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute and as market conditions change, regularly review and rebalance your investments across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on your long-term retirement goals. If your aim is to retire early, you might emphasize more contributions to taxable accounts for accessibility.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given individual circumstances vary greatly, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that reflects your unique situation, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Be sure to create a plan that aligns with your financial needs and retirement objectives while considering the unique features of each account type.
