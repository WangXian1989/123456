It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different types of accounts! However, it's important to remember that I can’t provide personal financial advice. 

In general, choosing how to allocate funds can depend on factors such as your goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, like a 401(k) and IRA, since they can offer tax benefits that taxable accounts do not. 

You might consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for its tax advantages. 

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the limit.

4. **Taxable Account**: Once you’re maxing out your retirement accounts, you can think about investing in a taxable brokerage account, which provides flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Think about how your risk tolerance affects the type of assets you hold in each account. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential.

Make sure to review your strategy regularly and adjust based on changes in your financial situation and goals. For tailored advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor.
