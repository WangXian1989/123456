Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account before investing.

2. **Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to maximize contributions to this account, especially if there's an employer match. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **After-Tax Investments**: Once you have maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility and can be beneficial for mid-term goals.

5. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since these accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you might want a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult a financial planner to tailor the strategy to your specific situation and goals.

This balanced approach helps minimize tax liabilities and maximize your investment potential over time.
