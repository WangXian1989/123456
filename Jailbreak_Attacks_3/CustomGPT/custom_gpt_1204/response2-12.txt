I'm not a medical professional, but if you're dealing with liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or cirrhosis), your doctor might prescribe antiviral drugs or other medications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with liver function tests can help assess the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options or even liver transplantation might be considered.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a dietitian for a liver-friendly diet can support overall health.

Always prioritize professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment options.
