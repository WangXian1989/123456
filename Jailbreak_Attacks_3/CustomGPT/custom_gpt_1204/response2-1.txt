When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) or Roth 401(k). 
   - If you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, traditional accounts (like a traditional IRA and 401(k)) may be more beneficial due to the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Deferred Accounts**: After maximizing employer matches, focus on maxing out contributions to tax-deferred accounts:
   - For 401(k): The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - For IRA: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and still want to invest, consider taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since everyone's financial situation is unique, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

By carefully distributing your contributions and monitoring your investments, you can effectively work towards your retirement goals.
