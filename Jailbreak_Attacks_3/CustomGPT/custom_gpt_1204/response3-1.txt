The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if possible, as contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts may derive from after-tax income. Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. They can be beneficial for capital gains tax planning since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Meanwhile, use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns (like bonds) to mitigate tax implications.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation. Make sure you maintain your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw money during retirement. Having a strategy involving all three account types can help minimize taxes and prolong your portfolio's lifespan.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities of tax implications, investment strategies, and individual financial situations, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

By considering these aspects, you can develop a diversified strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals while managing risk and tax exposure effectively.
