Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to Roth IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - After the employer match, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions for tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Fund IRA First if Roth Is Not an Option**
   - If you can’t contribute to a Roth IRA, prioritize a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for other investments. 

### 6. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate investments based on how soon you’ll need the money and your comfort with market fluctuations.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider getting personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This diversified approach balances growth and tax efficiency over time.
