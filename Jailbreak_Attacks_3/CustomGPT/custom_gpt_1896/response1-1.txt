The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here if your employer offers a match. Consider increasing contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth. If you prefer tax deferral, a traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This is especially important if you plan to access your funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and adjust your contributions and allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
