I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options you might consider for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, certain medications can help manage symptoms or treat infections.

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but always consult a doctor before starting any supplements.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track your liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options or liver transplantation might be necessary.

Make sure to discuss with a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your needs.
