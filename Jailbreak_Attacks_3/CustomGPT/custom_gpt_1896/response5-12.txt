I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, reduce alcohol intake, and maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Possible Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
