Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is often free money and a good starting point.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These allow for flexible access to your money and tax treatment on capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains when you sell investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Account Types and Investment Goals**: Align investments in each account with your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
