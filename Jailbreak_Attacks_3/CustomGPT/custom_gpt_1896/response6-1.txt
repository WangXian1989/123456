To optimize your financial strategy, consider these tips for distributing your savings among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Leverage Tax Advantages
- **IRAs**: Choose between traditional or Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains, like index funds or ETFs. This helps manage tax liabilities.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- **Tax Strategy**: Plan withdrawals based on the tax implications. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to minimize taxes on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

This balanced approach can maximize your growth and minimize tax burdens over time. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
