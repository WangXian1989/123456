To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on your IRA or Roth IRA next. IRAs offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, so prioritize if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals but will incur taxes on gains and dividends.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Taxes on Withdrawals**: Plan for the tax implications of each account. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.

7. **Long-Term Growth Focus**: If you have a long investment horizon, lean towards growth-oriented investments, especially in your tax-advantaged accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your financial goals and situation.
