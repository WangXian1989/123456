Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, prioritize your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax advantages (Traditional vs. Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They provide more liquidity but less tax efficiency.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) now.

5. **Diversification of Investments**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk and enhance growth potential.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocation based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
