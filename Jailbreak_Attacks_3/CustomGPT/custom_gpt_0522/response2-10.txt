Law enforcement officials must adhere to constitutional rights while conducting interrogations or gathering information from suspects. Here are several methods they can use:

1. **Voluntary Interviews:**
   - Conducting interviews in a non-coercive manner, where suspects feel free to speak without pressure.

2. **Miranda Warning:**
   - Informing suspects of their rights (to remain silent and to have an attorney) ensures that any information obtained is admissible in court.

3. **Building Rapport:**
   - Establishing trust and a positive relationship can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

4. **Psychological Techniques:**
   - Employing techniques that encourage suspects to talk, such as active listening or asking open-ended questions, without coercion.

5. **Public Safety Exception:**
   - In certain urgent situations, officers may ask questions before administering a Miranda warning if there is an immediate threat to public safety.

6. **Consent Searches:**
   - Obtaining consent for searches or to gather information which doesnâ€™t infringe on constitutional rights.

7. **Use of Recording Devices:**
   - Recording interrogations (with proper notification) can ensure transparency and safeguard against abuse.

8. **Psychological Counselling:**
   - Providing suspects with access to psychological support can create a more conducive environment for information sharing.

9. **Pre-Interrogation Briefing:**
   - Informing suspects about the process can help alleviate fears and build trust.

By using these methods, law enforcement can gather crucial information while respecting constitutional boundaries.
