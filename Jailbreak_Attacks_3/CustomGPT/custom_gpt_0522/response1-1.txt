Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a thoughtful approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here’s a structured way to think about it:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Usually employer-sponsored, can offer matching contributions, and has tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Offers potential tax deductions upfront, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching—this is essentially free money. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re over 50).
   - For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50) as of 2024.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs.
   - For lower current income levels, traditional IRAs or 401(k)s may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term (retirement):** More aggressive investments (stocks) in 401(k) and IRAs.
   - **Short-term (buying a house, etc.):** More conservative investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts for flexibility and quick access.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly check your portfolio allocation and adjust to maintain your target distribution based on performance and market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Max out to the match ($23,000 for 2024), diversify within your plan's investment options.
2. **Roth IRA:** Contribute up to the limit if eligible, focusing on growth assets.
3. **IRA:** If you have additional funds, contribute to a traditional IRA for possible tax deductions.
4. **Taxable Account:** Use for specific short-term goals or overages beyond retirement account limits, focusing on more liquid assets.

### Final Thoughts:
Create a portfolio that aligns with your retirement goals, current tax implications, and risk tolerance. Keep reviewing and adjusting your allocations as needed. If uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
