Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially "free money").
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are usually taxed at lower rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Opt for higher growth investments like stocks since withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income later.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Current vs. Future Tax Rates**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your future withdrawals to manage taxable income in retirement effectively.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Balance the risk level across all accounts based on your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance.
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified among various asset classes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your investment distribution periodically to reflect changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

By strategically syncing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial landscape.
