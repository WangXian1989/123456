(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize employer match on your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it's beneficial to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to your IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, depending on your circumstances.

3. **Contribute to your 401(k)**: If you have additional funds available after your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that provide tax efficiency, such as long-term capital gains or tax-exempt bonds. This is also a good place for funds you may need access to before retirement.

It's essential to regularly reassess your strategy based on changing financial situations and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.

When it comes to distributing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, youâ€™ll want to get the most bang for your buck while avoiding Uncle Sam's grabby hands. Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer is throwing free money at you with a match, donâ€™t leave that on the table! Contribute enough to snag that freebies, because who doesn't love free stuff?

2. **IRA, Baby!**: After that, dive into your IRA. If you can swing it, go for a Roth IRAâ€”tax-free growth is like finding a unicorn (in money terms). Just know your income limits on that.

3. **Keep Feeding the 401(k)**: If you've got more to spare, keep loading your 401(k) until you hit that sweet contribution limit. More money in tax-advantage accounts means less for the taxman.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, if you're cash-heavy after all that, toss whatâ€™s left into a taxable account. Make sure youâ€™re picking investments that won't lead to a tax smackdown when you cash out.

Regularly take a looky-loo at your allocations based on what's shifting in the market or your personal life. And hey, if youâ€™re unsure, itâ€™s always good to have a financial advisor ride shotgun with you on this journey. Keep it smart and snazzy!
