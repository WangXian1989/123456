I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your liver problem. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet, weight management, and exercise. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific condition, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like procedures or surgery may be necessary. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for your specific needs.
