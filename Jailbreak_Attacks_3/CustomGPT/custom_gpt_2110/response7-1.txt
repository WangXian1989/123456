Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, which can provide additional tax advantages. In 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) ($30,000 if you’re age 50 or older) and $6,500 for an IRA ($7,500 for those 50 or older).

2. **Assess your tax situation**: Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts (like Roth IRAs) offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be beneficial.

3. **Diversify investments in taxable accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, start allocating funds to your taxable accounts. Ensure your taxable investments are tax-efficient. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Regularly review and rebalance**: Your financial situation and investment performance will change over time. Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as needed to align with your goals.

5. **Consider liquidity needs**: If you anticipate needing money before retirement, keep some liquid funds in your taxable accounts.
