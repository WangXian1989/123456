Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), start by contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers tax-deferred growth and a match, contribute up to the match limit. This account is usually less flexible in terms of investment choices.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits if you qualify.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you're age 50 or older for 2023)
   - IRA: $6,500 (plus $1,000 if you're age 50 or older for 2023)

4. **Invest in a Taxable Account**: Once you've maxed out the employer match and considered your IRA contributions, invest additional money in a taxable account if you have short- to mid-term goals, or if you expect to need liquidity.

5. **Take Tax Implications into Account**: 
   - Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes. Consider placing investments that generate frequent dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts can help offset gains.

6. **Diversify Your Portfolio**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

7. **Reassess Your Strategy Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as needed.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and long-term goals.
