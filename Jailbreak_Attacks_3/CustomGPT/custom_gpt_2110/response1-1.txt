Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, and the money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility with your investments but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt first, as it can negate investment gains.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Align your account contributions with your retirement goals. For long-term growth, prioritize accounts like 401(k) and IRAs.

7. **Evaluate Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust as necessary based on market changes and personal circumstances.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so these suggestions should be tailored to fit your individual needs!
