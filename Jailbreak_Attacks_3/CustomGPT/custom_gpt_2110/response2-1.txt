When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take various factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to increase your retirement savings.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Understand the contribution limits for each account type. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. This can be beneficial for investments intended for short-term use or if you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA), while tax-efficient assets (like stocks) may be better held in taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. This fund should typically cover three to six months' worth of expenses and be easily accessible, suggesting a focus on lower-risk, liquid accounts.

6. **Future Financial Goals**:
   - Think about when you’ll need the money. If you’re saving for a near-term goal, prioritize taxable accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and make any necessary adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Every individual’s financial situation is unique, so it may also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
