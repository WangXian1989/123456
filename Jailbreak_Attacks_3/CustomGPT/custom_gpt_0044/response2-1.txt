Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income in the short term. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Consider prioritizing Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages, but they're flexible for withdrawals without penalties. They may generate capital gains taxes on sales and dividends.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in these accounts. A general recommendation is to have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved.

4. **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across asset classes in all accounts. Different accounts can hold different types of investments—consider stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, investors withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy right for your personal situation.
