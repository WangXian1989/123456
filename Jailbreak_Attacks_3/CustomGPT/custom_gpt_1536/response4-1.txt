When considering the distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Some plans offer a Roth 401(k) option for post-tax contributions, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your tax situation to determine which is more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on your earnings.

4. **Balanced Allocation**: Aim for a diversified portfolio within each account type, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Maintain a balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance as market conditions change.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider how withdrawals from each type of account will affect your taxable income and long-term financial plan. A tax-efficient withdrawal strategy can help minimize taxes in retirement.

Ultimately, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances and goals.
