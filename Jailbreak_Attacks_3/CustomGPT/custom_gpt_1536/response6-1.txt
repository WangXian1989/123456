To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maxing out employer matches first as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, tax implications can vary. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be aware that investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Prioritize placing investments that yield high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term Growth**: If you are investing for long-term growth, focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize compounding.
   - **Short-term Liquidity**: If you need access to funds sooner, allocate more to taxable accounts but be mindful of the tax implications on earnings.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA before directing funds to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

By carefully evaluating these aspects, you can achieve a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your investments.
