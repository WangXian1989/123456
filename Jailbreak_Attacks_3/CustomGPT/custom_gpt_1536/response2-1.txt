The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your income is high enough to benefit from the tax deduction.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider maxing out this account if you are eligible.
   - Traditional IRAs could be advantageous if you lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any additional savings can be directed here, especially for short-term goals or if you have already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient investments.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Regardless of accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio suited to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given the complexity of individual circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your unique situation.

Regularly reviewing your allocations in light of changes to your income, financial goals, or tax laws is also advisable.
