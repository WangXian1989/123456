Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: This can be beneficial if you currently need a tax deduction. 
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for both types of IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can provide greater flexibility when it comes to accessing funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be aware of the tax implications of any investments in these accounts, as you’ll owe taxes on earnings and capital gains.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with the 401(k) up to the match, then fund an IRA, and lastly allocate anything extra to a taxable account. This approach balances tax savings and flexibility.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is also recommended.
