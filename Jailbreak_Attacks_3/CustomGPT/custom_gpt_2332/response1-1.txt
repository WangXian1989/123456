Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize employer match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on tax advantages**: Contribute to your IRA, especially if you can get tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA). 

3. **Diversify investments**: Consider the types of investments in each account. Tax-advantaged accounts can hold higher-growth assets since they won't be taxed until withdrawal (Traditional) or at withdrawal (Roth).

4. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Consider keeping more liquid and easily accessible investments in taxable accounts, as they typically allow for easier withdrawals and fewer penalties.

5. **Rebalance periodically**: Review your allocations every year to ensure they still align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, itâ€™s a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
