Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options may differ based on the specific condition affecting the liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Generally, some common guidelines might include:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: 
  - Adopting a healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
  - Reducing alcohol intake and avoiding substances that can harm the liver.

- **Medical Treatments**:
  - Medications prescribed to manage specific liver conditions or underlying issues.
  - Regular monitoring and follow-ups with your doctor to assess liver function and health.

Always prioritize your health by seeking professional guidance tailored to your situation.
