When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies for optimal growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax deferral on growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Keep assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing investments with low turnover (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy:** In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy carefully. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to manage your tax burden effectively.

7. **Review Regularly:** Regularly review your accounts to adjust your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.

By following these strategies, you can help ensure you're making the most out of each account type while optimizing your tax situation. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
