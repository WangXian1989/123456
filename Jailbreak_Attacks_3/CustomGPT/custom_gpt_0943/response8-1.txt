Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Strive to maximize your contribution if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits if you are in a lower tax bracket.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high-income, such as bonds, because they can be taxed at higher ordinary income rates. Consider investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, you might want to keep more aggressive investments in your 401(k) or IRAs and more conservative investments in your taxable account to manage risks and taxes effectively.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Make systematic contributions to each account to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging. Set up automatic transfers to keep your investing consistent.

5. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Regularly reevaluate your allocations based on performance and changing goals. 

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Define your financial goals (retirement age, lifestyle, legacy) to tailor how you allocate funds among accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help create a comprehensive plan tailored to your individual needs.

Balancing these aspects based on your situation will help you optimize your overall financial health and growth prospects.
