I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common treatment options for liver issues. The best treatment depends on the specific condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or another liver disorder. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and reduce fat deposits.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications might be prescribed.
   - In cases of fatty liver disease, medications to control underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol may help.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and lab tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, especially with cirrhosis, liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - Limiting or eliminating alcohol and avoiding environmental toxins is crucial for preserving liver health.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
