The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. As of 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while traditional and Roth IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Provides similar tax benefits as a 401(k) but has different eligibility requirements for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This account is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have contribution limits and provide flexibility. However, investment gains could result in capital gains taxes, so itâ€™s best to hold investments long-term to minimize tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when determining how to allocate funds among accounts. You may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your portfolio across all accounts. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how and when to withdraw from each account during retirement. Combining withdrawals from taxable accounts and tax-advantaged accounts can help manage your tax liability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to seek advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

This distribution strategy can help you make the most of your investments while considering taxes and retirement goals.
