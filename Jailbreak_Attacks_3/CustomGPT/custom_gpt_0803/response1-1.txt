The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here won't receive the same tax advantages, so consider keeping your higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. You can hold different asset allocations in each account based on the purpose of the funds and tax implications.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Keep some cash in a taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs rather than tying everything up in retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Growth**: If youâ€™re younger and have a long time until retirement, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your goals and market performance.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: They can help tailor a distribution strategy that best fits your unique situation.

Always consider your long-term financial plan and adjust your contributions as necessary!
