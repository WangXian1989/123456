The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Consider this option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which type aligns better with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need access to before retirement. Investment income may be taxed annually, so consider the tax impact of your investment choices here.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations as your goals change, and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that takes into account your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
