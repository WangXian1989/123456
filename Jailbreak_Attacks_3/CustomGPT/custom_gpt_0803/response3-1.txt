Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps you can follow to develop a strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; contributions are often pre-tax. Employers may match contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalty.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine whether your primary goal is retirement savings or short-term liquidity.
   - Decide how much you need to have saved for retirement, which can guide your contributions.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Maximize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - Evaluate your expected tax rate in retirement versus your current rate to decide between traditional or Roth accounts.

4. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider fully funding an IRA (preferably a Roth IRA if eligible and it suits your tax situation).

5. **Diversify Among Accounts**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks) and consider more stable investments (bonds) in your taxable account to balance risk.
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax implications when investing in taxable accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and adjust your contributions as needed based on market conditions and your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
