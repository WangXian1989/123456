When considering how to allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place lower-yield, less tax-efficient investments here (like bonds or high turnover mutual funds) to minimize your tax burden.
   - **Growth Stocks**: They can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to potential tax implications upon sale.

### 3. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**
   - Assess your retirement goals and how soon you plan to retire. More aggressive investments can be placed in accounts that will not offer immediate access, like your 401(k) and IRA.

### 4. **Consistency and Review**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to 401(k) to secure employer match**.
- **Invest in tax-efficient vehicles in taxable accounts**.
