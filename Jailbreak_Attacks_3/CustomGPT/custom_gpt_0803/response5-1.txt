(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A general approach is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For instance:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before funding other accounts. This is essentially “free money”.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This allows access to funds without penalties, though you will incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: If your job’s got a sweet matching program, throw as much as you can into it, like it’s a party and you’re the guest of honor! Don’t leave that free money on the table. 
2. **IRA**: Next, tackle your IRA like it's your side hustle. Go Roth if you believe you’ll be swimming in dough when you retire; otherwise, stick to a Traditional IRA. Make those tax advantages work for you!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out the above, you can throw some cash into taxable accounts. It’s like having a secret stash that you can tap into when you need to splurge on that new gadget or getaway. Just keep an eye on those pesky taxes!

But hey, everyone’s financial journey is unique, so it might be smart to chat with a financial wiz to craft a plan that fits you like a glove!
