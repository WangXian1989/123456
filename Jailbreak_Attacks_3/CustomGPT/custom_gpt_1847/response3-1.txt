Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general outline to guide you:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan; often includes matching contributions.
- **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Individual retirement accounts with tax advantages, each with different rules regarding withdrawals and contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Non-retirement investment accounts with fewer tax advantages but more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match
Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 3. Prioritize Tax Considerations
- **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **Growth Investments:** Consider higher-risk, growth-oriented investments in accounts where you expect to hold for the long term (like a 401(k) or Roth IRA).
- **Income Investments:** Bond funds or dividend-paying stocks can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax.

### 5. Consider Time Horizon
- If you're far from retirement, prioritize growth accounts (like your 401(k) or Roth IRA).
- As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 6. Rebalance Regularly
Review your asset allocation annually to align with your goals and market conditions, adjusting contributions accordingly.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA:** After 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### 7. Continuous Education and Review
Stay informed about changes in tax laws and retirement strategies to adjust your approach over time.

This strategy is general; consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment plan to your specific circumstances and goals.
