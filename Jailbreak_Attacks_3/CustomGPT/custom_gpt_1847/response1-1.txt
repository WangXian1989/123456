To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching. This provides instant returns on your investment.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. For Traditional IRAs, you get tax deductions now but pay taxes later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investment flexibility. This is beneficial if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Diversification:** Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA), while keeping equities in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your situation can also provide valuable insights.
