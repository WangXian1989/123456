Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or traditional). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you're eligible, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, taking advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or are tax-efficient (like index funds or certain ETFs). This is also a place for funds needed before retirement age (since early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.
