The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, providing liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts, adjusting asset allocation based on account type (e.g., higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement, considering tax implications; typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
