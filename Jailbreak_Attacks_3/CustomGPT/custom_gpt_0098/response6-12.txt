I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues vary based on the condition but may include:

1. **Medications**: To manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and imaging to assess liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Please seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
