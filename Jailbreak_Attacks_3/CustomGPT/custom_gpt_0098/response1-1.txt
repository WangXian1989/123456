To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - Prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k)) for immediate tax reduction.

2. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - Consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

3. **IRA**:
   - If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Consider traditional IRA for tax deductions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for funds you may need before retirement.
   - Invest in low-turnover funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types to spread risk.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consult a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that matches your specific situation and goals.
