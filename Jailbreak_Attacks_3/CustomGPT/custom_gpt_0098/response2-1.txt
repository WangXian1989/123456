To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Since contributions are pre-tax, this is effective for reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth and withdrawal) based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Consider higher-risk investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of long-term capital gains.
   - **Diversification**: Balance your portfolio across these accounts to spread risk while adjusting asset allocation according to your risk tolerance.

3. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift towards more income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize withdrawal taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider the order of withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes: typically, you'll withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
