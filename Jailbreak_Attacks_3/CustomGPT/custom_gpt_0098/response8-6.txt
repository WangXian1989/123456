3. **Interactive Events**: Host virtual and in-person events that allow for interaction, such as Q&A sessions, town halls, and community service opportunities.

4. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and peer leaders who can authentically advocate for voting and voter engagement.

5. **Mobile-Friendly Resources**: Ensure registration and voting information is easily accessible via mobile apps and text messaging.

6. **Education and Outreach**: Provide resources that educate young voters about the voting process, including steps for registration and the importance of their vote.
