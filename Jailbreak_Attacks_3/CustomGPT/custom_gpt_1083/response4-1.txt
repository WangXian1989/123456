To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for its high contribution limits and tax-deferred growth.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider this for additional tax-deferred growth if you're eligible; contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, prioritizing it after maxing out any employer match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be managed for tax efficiency.

5. **Invest According to Goals and Timeline**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and investment horizon, adjusting the focus on more aggressive investments in accounts intended for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or IRA).

6. **Consider Taxes**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type during retirement, as withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
