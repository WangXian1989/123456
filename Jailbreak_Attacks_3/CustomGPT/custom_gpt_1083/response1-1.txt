Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts. This gives you flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance. Generally, a higher risk (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure you remain aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments while reducing tax liabilities.
