To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA after your 401(k) contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments that receive favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains) or for funds you'll need in the near future.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals: Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s), and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk. Use your 401(k) for growth-oriented investments and your taxable accounts for more liquid, lower-risk investments.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your retirement timeline. Adjust the risk levels of your investments as you approach retirement.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
