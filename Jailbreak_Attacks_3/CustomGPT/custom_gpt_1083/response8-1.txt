To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to at least get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money".

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions. IRAs can offer tax advantages that can be beneficial for your long-term savings.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: Consider balancing your contributions based on:
   - **Current Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might be wise to prioritize pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA). If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) can be advantageous.
   - **Future Tax Needs**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility for accessing funds, which can be valuable.

4. **Invest Strategically**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in investment choices. Choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment options. Consider a diversified portfolio with stocks, bonds, and potentially alternative investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that have favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) and consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes over the long term.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice tailored to your situation can provide additional insights, especially regarding tax implications.

Following these principles, you can create a well-balanced approach that maximizes your investments' potential while managing tax implications effectively.
