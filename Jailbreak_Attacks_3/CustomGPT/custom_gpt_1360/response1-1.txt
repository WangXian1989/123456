Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are after-tax contributions and can be more flexible for withdrawals, but you may face capital gains taxes on investment profits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months' expenses.

4. **Investment Horizon**: If you’re closer to retirement, you might prioritize safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA. Conversely, if you're younger, you can take advantage of higher-risk, higher-reward investments.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it’s a good idea to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Annual Reviews**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
