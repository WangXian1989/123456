The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions (the annual limits may vary), you can invest in a taxable account. This offers more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, while bonds or more conservative investments could be appropriate for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxable income and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions as market conditions and your financial situation change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
