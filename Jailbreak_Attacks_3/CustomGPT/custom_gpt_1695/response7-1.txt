To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, resume contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These can be useful for flexible access and potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you'll want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
