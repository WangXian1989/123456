Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out your employer match, if available—this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to the maximum limit ($22,500 for 2024; $30,000 if age 50+).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify, contribute to an IRA. For 2024, the max contribution is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+).
   - Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on stocks or ETFs that offer favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when selling investments.

### Key Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash reserves before heavily investing.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocation based on how much risk you're willing to take, especially in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

### Annual Review:
- Reassess your financial situation and adjust contributions as necessary, considering any changes in income or tax law.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
