It's great that you're thinking about how to efficiently distribute your money across different investment accounts! Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if you have a high-income tax rate. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to an IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA is beneficial because withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After fully funding your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you want flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. **Balance Asset Types:**
   - Within each account, balance stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you may want to hold higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are sheltered from taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Up to employer match, then 15% of salary.
- **IRA:** Max out contribution ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** After reaching the above limits, invest any additional funds.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your financial goals and situation.
