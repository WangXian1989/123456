To effectively distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, often employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax benefits depending on the type; Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but more flexibility for withdrawals and investments. 

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If you can afford to, aim to max out contributions to your IRA for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) if you’re far from retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, balance between growth and income-focused investments (bonds, dividend stocks).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income (index funds, ETFs), to be more tax-efficient.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawals Strategy**: Strategically plan withdrawals during retirement to minimize tax impact based on account types.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 50% (maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% (prioritize tax-advantaged growth)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% (flexibility, tax-efficient investments)

Adjust percentages based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor is also beneficial for tailored advice.
