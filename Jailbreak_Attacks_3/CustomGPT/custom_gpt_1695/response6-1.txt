Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
     - Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your current and future tax brackets.

   - **IRA:**
     - Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, prioritizing a Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Tax Efficiency:**
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
     - Hold fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as they generate taxable interest.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:**
     - Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to benefit from compound growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:**
     - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term goals, ensuring liquidity.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Monitor your asset allocation, investment performance, and changes in tax laws.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income or financial goals.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and considering the tax implications of your investments, you can optimize your financial strategy for growth and efficiency.
