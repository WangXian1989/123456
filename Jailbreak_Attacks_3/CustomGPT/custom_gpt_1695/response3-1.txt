To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your retirement goals, timeline, and risk tolerance.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or emergency funds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of total investments, focusing on growth-oriented funds
- **IRA**: 20-30%, mix of traditional and Roth based on tax strategy
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining 40-60%, focusing on low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

This balanced approach allows for growth while minimizing taxes over time.
