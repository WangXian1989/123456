To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
- **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment growth that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as short-term trading or investments that generate significant taxable income.

### 3. Diversification of Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments that can benefit from long-term tax-deferral.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 4. Withdrawals and Future Planning
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it's advised to withdraw funds from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider meeting with a financial planner who can help you create a comprehensive strategy.
