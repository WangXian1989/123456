Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest Additional Funds**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts or short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're diversifying across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Tax Bracket Considerations**: In retirement, think about the order of withdrawals (e.g., taxable first for better tax efficiency).

### 6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.
