Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: After the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have extra funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for both long-term investments and future liquidity needs.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure you diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from each account. Taxable accounts have different tax treatments compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary:
- Max out 401(k) employer match.
- Contribute to IRA (max out if possible).
- Invest in taxable accounts after tax-advantaged options.
- Diversify and rebalance investments regularly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
