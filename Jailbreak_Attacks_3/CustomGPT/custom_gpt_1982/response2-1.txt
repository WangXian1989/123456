Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions. For 2024, it's $23,000 (or $30,000 if age 50+) for 401(k)s and $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+) for IRAs.
   - **Diverse Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices (stocks, bonds, etc.) are diversified across all accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) or for short-term goals where you might need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes) and income-generating but less growth-oriented securities in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Timeline and Goals**
   - **Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, adjust your strategy to be more conservative.
   - **Financial Goals**: If you have specific goals (like buying a house), assess how much to allocate to your taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
