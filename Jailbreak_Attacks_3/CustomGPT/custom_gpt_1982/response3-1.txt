Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including tax implications, your investment goals, and your financial situation. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial in high-income years.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which helps reduce your taxable income. Suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. 
   - **Tax Considerations:** Keep low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments here to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Recommendations**
   - **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses saved.
   - **Balance Contributions:** Consider your current tax bracket and retirement goals when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.
   - **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and individual financial situations, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that best fits your needs.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often involves contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, maximizing IRA contributions, and using taxable accounts for additional savings and investments as appropriate. Review your strategy regularly to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.
