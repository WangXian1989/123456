To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with income limits for deductions if you're also participating in a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making this beneficial for younger savers or those in lower tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility in withdrawals.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 4. **Balance Contributions**
   - If youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) contributions, consider putting additional funds into an IRA or a Roth IRA.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may require more flexibility and timing.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Certain investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., bonds in 401(k)s/IRAs to minimize tax on interest).

### 6. **Consider Your Retirement Goals**
   - Align your contributions with your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Adjust the balance based on your needs and market conditions.

### 7. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of salary (to match employer contributions).
- **IRA/Roth IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.
