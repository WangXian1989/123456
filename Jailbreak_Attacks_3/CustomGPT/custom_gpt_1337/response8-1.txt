Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Consider traditional for tax-deferred growth or Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA allows for tax deductions now. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need before retirement. They offer flexibility and different tax treatments for capital gains and dividends.

4. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**: Invest in a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and when youâ€™ll need the money.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your allocation stays aligned with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Choose low-cost investment options to maximize your returns.

A financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.
