Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Max Out Contributions**:  
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversification**:  
   - Keep a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds) across all accounts. This can help balance risk.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**:  
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Since these accounts grow tax-deferred, invest in higher-growth assets (stocks, for example) here to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for lower-growth investments (like bonds) or tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax bills.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:  
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Ideally, you'll want to manage your withdrawals to minimize your tax burden each year.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:  
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on market changes, age, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
