To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and boosts your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Max out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional, depending on your situation).
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use any extra funds for taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, age, and financial goals:
   - Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax advantages and growth potential for your investments.
