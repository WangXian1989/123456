To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Depending on your income, max out your IRA contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on high-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Utilize your taxable accounts for more liquid and flexible investments.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Keep high-yield or dividend-paying investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are expected to generate lower capital gains (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance to ensure adherence to your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Regular Contributions and Monitoring**
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent investing.
   - Review and adjust allocations annually to reflect changes in financial goals or market conditions.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Prioritize employer matches** in your 401(k).
- **Maximize tax advantages** in your IRA.
- **Diversify investments** based on account tax implications.

Make sure to tailor your strategy to your specific goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial situation.
