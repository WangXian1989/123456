To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money!). After that, consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Consider holding investments for more than a year to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Place less volatile investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially higher tax rates on ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all account types to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

Always consider your individual financial situation and possibly consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
