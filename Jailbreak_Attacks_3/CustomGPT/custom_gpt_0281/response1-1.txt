To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first. This is essentially free money. Contribute up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Fund your IRA next. Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later. Aim to reach the max contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### Key Factors to Consider:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Investment Horizon**: Consider your timeline for each account. Long-term investments can grow tax-free in retirement accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your asset allocation periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve. 

Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
