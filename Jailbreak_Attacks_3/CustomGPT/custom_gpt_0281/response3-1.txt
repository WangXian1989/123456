Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: Consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA next, given its tax advantages. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation annually or as your financial situation changes.
