The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First:**
   - If you have an employer match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the money in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings from investments in taxable accounts (like dividends and capital gains) are subject to taxes in the year they are realized. Consider keeping tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance. For aggressive growth, you might lean toward stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable, income-generating investments might be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies. This should be separate from your retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust periodically based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and personal circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.

With these considerations in mind, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
