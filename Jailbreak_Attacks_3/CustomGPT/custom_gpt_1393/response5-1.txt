(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maxing out your contributions if possible, as 401(k) plans often offer tax advantages such as pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: After maximally contributing to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be very beneficial.

3. **Taxable Account**: Investments in a taxable account should typically come after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, but they can be a good option for investing money that you may need before retirement age or for more flexible withdrawal options.

This allocation strategy allows you to take advantage of the tax benefits while also ensuring liquidity and flexibility in your investments.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the classic money distribution conundrum! Letâ€™s break it down, shall we? 

1. **401(k)**: Sock away as much as you can here, especially if your employer is throwing in matching funds â€” thatâ€™s free money, baby! Aim for the max contribution if you can. It's like getting a discount on your future self.

2. **IRA**: Once you've milked the 401(k) for all it's worth, dive into an IRA. The traditional or Roth options both have their perks. Roth is like the cool underground club; you pay your dues now, and then you party tax-free later!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, look at taxable accounts as your wild card. After filling up the above buckets, use these funds for investments that might be needed sooner or if youâ€™re feeling spicy with your investment choices. Plus, you can play around with the taxes here, just keep an eye out for capital gains!

Just remember, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all, so tailor that distribution to your own financial goals and needs. Now go make some money moves! ðŸ¤‘
