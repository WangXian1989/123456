I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific liver condition you're facing. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. Please reach out to a medical provider for advice tailored to your situation.
