To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize funding tax-advantaged accounts, like your 401(k) and IRA, over taxable accounts. These accounts can significantly reduce your tax burden over time. 
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach your employer's match, then either max it out or redirect funds to your IRA.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions may lower your taxable income for the year, while Roth IRA contributions do not, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Interest, dividends, and capital gains from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so be strategic about how much you place in these accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or a similar liquid asset before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and retirement goals. Use tax-efficient investment strategies in your taxable accounts, such as holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired level of risk and to take advantage of market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy based on your unique financial situation and retirement goals.

Remember that individual circumstances vary, so consider your financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate your investments.
