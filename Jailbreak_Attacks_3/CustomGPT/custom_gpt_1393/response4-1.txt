It's important to consider your individual financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, here are some general strategies that many investors find helpful:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, it’s often advisable to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.” After that, consider your investment options within the 401(k) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) provide tax advantages that can be beneficial. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If lowering your taxable income now is a priority, traditional IRAs can provide the benefit of deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can offer flexibility since you can withdraw your investments at any time without penalty, unlike retirement accounts. However, they are subject to capital gains taxes. Invest in lower-turnover index funds, ETFs, or stocks that you plan to hold long-term to minimize tax liability.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with the 401(k) to maximize employer matching, contribute to an IRA for tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for additional investments or liquidity needs.
- **Balanced Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your overall financial strategy, considering asset allocation that aligns with your long-term goals.
- **Regular Review:** Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust contributions based on performance, market conditions, and changes in financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
