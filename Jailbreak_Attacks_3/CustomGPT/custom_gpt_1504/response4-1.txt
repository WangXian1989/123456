To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Tax Optimization**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money and provides immediate returns.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA offers immediate tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains and dividend tax rates. Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial goals. Allocate more towards long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort with risk and ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance across all accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure each account has a diversified portfolio. Utilize the unique tax advantages of each account to hold different types of assets.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on performance, changes in the market, or shifts in your personal financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
