Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits and take advantage of them.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, set aside 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid account.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for tax efficiency as needed.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance to stay aligned with your goals.

### Considerations:
- **Your Age**: Younger investors can typically take more risks, while those closer to retirement should focus on capital preservation.
- **Income Needs**: Consider your expected income needs in retirement to determine how much to withdraw from each account.
