(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on investments that benefit from long-term capital gains treatment.
4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, max that bad boy out! It's like finding cash on the sidewalkâ€”you donâ€™t leave that behind!
   
2. **IRA Time**: After snagging that employer match, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re into the Roth vibe, go for itâ€”youâ€™ll love those tax-free withdrawals later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Anything beyond that can chill in your taxable accounts. Just watch out for those taxesâ€”donâ€™t let Uncle Sam take more than he needs!

4. **Invest Smart**: Mix it up! Diversify your investments across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, whatever floats your boat. 

Remember, everyone's situation is different, so itâ€™s a good idea to chat with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
