To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following distribution methods:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
     - Maximize contributions here first, especially if your employer offers a match.
     - Focus on investments with high growth potential (e.g., stocks) since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains taxed at a lower rate.
     - Consider holding tax-efficient funds to reduce tax liability.

### 2. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Retirement Withdrawal Order**:
     - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue compounding.
     - Delay withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts until necessary to manage tax impact.

### 3. **Balance and Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to spread risk and enhance returns while considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for a 401(k) in 2024) to maximize tax benefits and growth potential.

By following these guidelines, you can create a robust investment strategy that minimizes tax burdens and maximizes returns over time.
