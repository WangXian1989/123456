To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Use IRAs for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for goals that require liquidity, as they offer easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) which may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps manage risk while pursuing growth.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as life circumstances and market conditions change.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your savings.

By balancing these elements, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
