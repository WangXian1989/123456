Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you can still contribute after funding an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to ensure you’re meeting your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your expected income in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, you might prioritize Roth accounts. If you expect a lower bracket, Traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
