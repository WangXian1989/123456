Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **Higher Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions to take advantage of higher limits (e.g., $22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
- **Investment Options:** Be mindful of the investment choices offered; fees may vary.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations:**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Best for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal for younger investors or those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Contribution Limit:** Stay within the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** Offers liquidity and no contribution limits, making it suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Asset Location:** Consider holding bonds and high-income generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax impact.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Fund the 401(k) to the match, then max out the IRA.**
2. **After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to the 401(k) again.**
3. **Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts as needed.**

#### **Considerations**
- Regularly review your investment allocations based on changing goals and market conditions.
- A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances might be beneficial.

This balanced approach can optimize your tax situation and support your long-term financial goals.
