Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and withdrawal goals.

3. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) with possible tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility and investing after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and consider long-term capital gains strategies.

5. **Balance Risk vs. Time Horizon**: Adjust asset allocation based on your investment timeline, with more aggressive investments earlier on and more conservative as retirement approaches.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to minimize risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your life circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
