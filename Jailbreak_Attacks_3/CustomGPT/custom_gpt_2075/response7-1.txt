Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning based on your current financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Advantages**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now; potential employer matching can enhance your savings.
- **Strategy**: Maximize employer contributions, especially the match. If you can, aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year (for 2023, it’s $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income, but taxes are due upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Strategy**: 
  - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA.
  - If you’re looking for immediate tax benefits, opt for a Traditional IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Advantages**: Flexibility in accessing money without penalties; capital gains taxes apply only when you sell assets.
- **Strategy**: Use these accounts for short-term savings or investments that you may want to withdraw from before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Distribution Strategy
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Start with 401(k) contributions, especially to get the full employer match.
   - Then, fund your IRA, prioritizing Roth if you can afford the tax hit now.
   - Finally, use any excess funds for your taxable account.

2. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) since taxes won’t impact your gains until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more income-producing assets (like bonds) to manage tax implications effectively.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline, adjusting contributions accordingly.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on your income level, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can help optimize your specific situation.
