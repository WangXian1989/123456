Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: After the match, or if you have no match, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. Understand Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax based on your income and the duration of your investments.

### 3. Allocate Based on Goals
- **Short-Term Goals**: Funds for near-term needs should go into taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings.

### 4. Investment Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your comfort with risk. Stocks can be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be better for stability.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 30% of your total retirement savings.
- **IRA**: 30% to 50%, depending on the account type and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining balance, especially for short-term investments or savings.

### Monitor and Adjust
- **Annual Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

By balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
