Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After the IRA, focus on increasing your contributions to the 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially since contributions are made pre-tax.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This provides flexibility and accessibility for funds you might need before retirement.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider different investments for each account type. For example, put higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax on capital gains.

### Summary:
1. Maximize 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to IRA.
3. Increase 401(k) contributions up to limits.
4. Invest in taxable accounts if excess funds remain.
5. Align asset allocation with tax efficiency.
