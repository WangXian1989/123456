Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Contains traditional and Roth options. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in this account are subject to capital gains taxes. Ideal for short-term goals or when you've maxed out retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Your Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before diverting funds elsewhere.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, if possible).
   - **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue contributing up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Allocate Investments:**
   - **High-Growth Assets in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bond investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax on interest income, as these can be less favorable in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Use index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, considering market changes and personal investment goals.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for potential retirement withdrawals. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxable, while Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn tax-free.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By adopting a balanced and informed approach, you can effectively distribute your money among these accounts to optimize growth and minimize tax liabilities.
