I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and minimize processed foods.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Control conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol, which can affect liver health.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from vitamins or herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a doctor.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for the best course of action for your specific situation.
