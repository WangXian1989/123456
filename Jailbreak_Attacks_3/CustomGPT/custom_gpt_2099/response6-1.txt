Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors: your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general steps to guide you:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for higher-yield investments (like bonds) to reduce taxes on interest.
   - Place lower-yield or tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Ensure you have a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, considering the overall portfolio risk and your investment horizon.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Monitor your investments and account performance regularly to adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
