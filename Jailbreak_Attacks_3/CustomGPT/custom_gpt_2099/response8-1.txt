Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize employer match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Especially if your employer matches, maxing this out can be beneficial. Contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs can reduce taxable income.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for longer-term savings or for money you may need before retirement. They can be beneficial for tax management due to capital gains treatment.

4. **Consider tax implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so holding investments long-term can be advantageous.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Reassess regularly**: Financial situations change, so review your distribution strategy periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
