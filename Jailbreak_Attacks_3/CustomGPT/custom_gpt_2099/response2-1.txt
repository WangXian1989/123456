Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then aim to reach the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. This helps manage risk.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan for which accounts you will draw from in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

6. **Review Periodically**:
   - Reassess your allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### Final Tip
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.
