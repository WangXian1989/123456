It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but general treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit alcohol intake.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of harmful substances, such as certain medications and illicit drugs, that can further damage the liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions might be necessary, such as a liver transplant.

Consulting with a specialist, like a hepatologist, is crucial to create an appropriate treatment plan tailored to your condition.
