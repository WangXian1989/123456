Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax strategy. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for investments you might need before retirement or for more flexible withdrawal options. Gains are taxed, but long-term capital gains rates can be lower than ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Investment Horizons**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize retirement accounts for growth. Typically, equity-focused investments work well in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher growth and compounding.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Allocate more funds into taxable accounts if you may need access to your money within a few years. Choose investments that are efficient for taxable accounts (e.g., index funds).

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Revisit your contributions and allocation annually or after significant life changes (e.g., marriage, job change) to ensure they align with your goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10-20% of your income until you hit the company match, then increase as possible.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if you can afford it ($6,500/year or $7,500 if 50+ for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any leftover funds for flexibility and potential short-term needs.

### Key Takeaway:
A balanced approach focusing on maximizing contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity through taxable accounts can provide both short-term flexibility and long-term growth. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
