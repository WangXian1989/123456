Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA and 401(k) to benefit from tax deferrals (traditional accounts) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth accounts).

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options. If not, traditional accounts might be better for deferring taxes.

### 4. **Strategic Use of Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or ETFs, and hold them long-term to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 5. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically revisit your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution varies by individual circumstances. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
