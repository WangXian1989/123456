To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA Accounts**: Next, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: For your taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies if applicable.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities are favorable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while fixed income or cash-equivalents might be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of your tax situation. Placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts can help maximize benefits.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk levels and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, seek advice from a financial professional for personalized guidance tailored to your financial goals.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to managing your investments across different account types.
