Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match.
     - Consider increasing contributions to the maximum limit if your cash flow allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
     - If eligible, max out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
     - Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that offer:
     - Greater liquidity for short-term goals.
     - Tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Growth:**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts.
     - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer time horizons can justify a higher allocation to stocks, while shorter ones may necessitate a more conservative approach.
