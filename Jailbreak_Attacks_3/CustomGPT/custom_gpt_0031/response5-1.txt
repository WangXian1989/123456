Certainly! Here's how to think about distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income since they’re made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**:
     - **Roth IRA**: Great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, lowering taxable income now.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Make sure to stay within the annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Allocation Strategy
- **Debt Payoff**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying it off first.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Age-Based Strategy**: Generally, the younger you are, the more you can afford to invest in higher-risk assets.

### Example Distribution Approach
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, max out a Roth IRA (if eligible) or traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest additional savings in a diversified, tax-efficient manner.

### Adjust as Needed
Review and adjust your allocations annually based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
