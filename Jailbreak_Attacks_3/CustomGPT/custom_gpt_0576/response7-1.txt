Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** After the match, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit). Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA next. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable investment accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing liquidity before retirement.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Investments in tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-deferred. Taxable accounts, however, can incur capital gains tax. To minimize taxes, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Asset allocation should be diversified across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation as your situation changes (income, expenses, retirement goals).

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (enough to get the match)
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (up to the annual limit)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation. Overall, balancing contributions based on tax benefits and liquidity needs will help you maximize your investment growth.
