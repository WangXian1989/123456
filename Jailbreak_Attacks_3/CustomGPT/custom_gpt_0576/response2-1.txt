The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general framework to guide your decisions:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Contribution limits are lower than for 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. They are ideal for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Debt and Emergency Fund:** Before investing heavily, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and pay down high-interest debt.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions before returning to your 401(k).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax Diversification:** Aim for a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts to have flexibility in retirement. This strategy, known as tax diversification, can help manage your tax liabilities over time.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** In retirement, think about the order of withdrawals (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first could reduce future tax burdens).

### 4. **Allocate Investments:**
   - **Growth vs. Income:** Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable income-generating investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts to manage taxes more effectively.

### 5. **Regular Review:** 
   - Your situation and market conditions change. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to get employer match (let’s say 6% of salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable limit, choosing between Traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining funds based on your risk tolerance, focusing on investments that can provide flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Personal finance is deeply individual. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial adviser who can analyze your specific situation and help develop a customized plan that takes into account your overall financial picture, goals, and current market conditions.
