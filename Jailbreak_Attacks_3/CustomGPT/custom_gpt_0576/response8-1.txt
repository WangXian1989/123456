To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, and possibly employer matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but usually has lower contribution limits. A Traditional IRA is tax-deferred, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After maxing out the employer match, prioritize contributions to an IRA. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible based on income limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts as Needed**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment after maxing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This is especially useful if you're saving for a goal before retirement.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Balance investing in accounts with different tax treatments. For example, put high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable, lower-growth investments that might produce dividends or interest income.

6. **Adjust for Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors might lean more heavily towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prioritize bonds and stable investments.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust as needed to maintain your target percentages and adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals.
