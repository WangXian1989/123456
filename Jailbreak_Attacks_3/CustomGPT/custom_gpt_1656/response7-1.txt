To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maximizing your IRA contributions.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Account**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can offer more flexibility for withdrawals but is subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments, like bonds, in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient assets, like index funds, in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your investment strategy and rebalance as necessary based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.
