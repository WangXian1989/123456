To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you anticipate a higher income later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings that you might need before retirement. They are also flexible for investments in stocks or ETFs, which can be tax-efficient due to capital gains treatment.

4. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**: Compare investment options and fees in each account. Often, IRAs and 401(k)s have more investment choices than taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
