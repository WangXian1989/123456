Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Good for higher earnings, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before funneling too much into retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing retirement accounts and if you have surplus cash, consider taxable accounts for more accessible funds. This can be useful for short-term goals and offers flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Riskier investments might belong in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can go in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance, market conditions, and shifts in your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
