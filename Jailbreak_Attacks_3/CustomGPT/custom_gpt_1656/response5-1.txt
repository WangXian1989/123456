Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing this out after your 401(k) contributions.

### 2. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once youâ€™ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This offers liquidity and can be a good place for assets you may need before retirement.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since these accounts benefit from tax deferment.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically check your asset allocation in all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

### Key Takeaway:
Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax benefits, then consider taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate access. Adjust your investment strategy based on tax implications and long-term goals.
