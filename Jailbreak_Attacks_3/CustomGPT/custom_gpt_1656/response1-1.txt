Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. They offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.

4. **Debt and Expenses**: Consider paying off high-interest debt before investing heavily in taxable accounts. 

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before directing a large portion of your savings into investments.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or after maxing out tax-advantaged options. They provide flexibility but may be subject to capital gains tax.

7. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within these accounts to balance risk and return, focusing on your long-term goals.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your personal financial situation.
