Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that may generate capital gains and dividends that are taxed annually. Keep longer-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks), while holding bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### Sample Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total investments (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: 15-20% of your total investments
- **Taxable Account**: The remainder, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, your specific goals and financial situation will dictate the best approach, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
