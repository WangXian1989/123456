To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Pre-tax contributions reduce current taxable income; withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Good for younger individuals or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
  
3. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for any additional investments. These can provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. Different accounts can hold different types of assets based on their tax treatment and your financial goals.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals, considering factors such as current age, retirement age, and expected expenses.

Lastly, it's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
