To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account offers tax advantages; can be a Traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (after-tax contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested after-tax money. You'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term, growth-focused investments since they can benefit from deferred taxes.
   - Keep more liquid and lower-growth investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on less favorable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and reward effectively.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) ($22,500 or $30,000 for those over 50 in 2023) and IRAs ($6,500 or $7,500 for those over 50).

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is many years away, orient more towards equities in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon is ideal. Would you like more details on any specific area?
