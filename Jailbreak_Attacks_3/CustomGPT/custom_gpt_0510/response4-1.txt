When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize for growth, tax efficiency, and access to funds:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maximizing contributions to the account, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Also, consider holding less tax-efficient assets here (like bonds) to avoid higher tax burdens in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**:
   - If you plan to access funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts, as they provide the most flexibility without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Annually review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance to ensure optimal allocation.

For tailored advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation. Would you like assistance in developing a more detailed plan or specific allocation percentages?
