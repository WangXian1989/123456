Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
- **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
- **Contribution Limits:** Keep in mind the annual contribution limits (for 2024, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if over 50).

### 2. **Traditional IRA**
- **Tax Deductibility:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and whether you have a workplace retirement plan.
- **Withdrawal Rules:** Be mindful of penalties for early withdrawals before age 59½.

### 3. **Roth IRA**
- **Tax-Free Growth:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Income Limits:** Eligibility phases out at higher income levels.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** While these accounts don't have the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties.
- **Tax Implications:** Be aware of capital gains taxes—holding investments for over one year can lower your tax rate.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Max Out Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k).
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Prioritize a Roth IRA if eligible; otherwise, a Traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or if you max out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Portfolio Diversification**
Balance your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider a good mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### **Review Regularly**
Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
