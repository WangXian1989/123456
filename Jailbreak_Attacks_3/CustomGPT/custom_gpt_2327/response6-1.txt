To effectively distribute your assets among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

**1. Understand Tax Implications:**  
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income, but distributions in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Suitable for higher income now.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if conditions are met. Choose based on your current tax bracket versus expected future bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here don’t benefit from tax deferral. However, they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

**2. Allocation Strategy:**  
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then to your IRA to fully utilize contributions. Aim for a balance that aligns with your retirement goals while considering tax efficiency.
   - **Diversify Within Accounts:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring you’re not overly reliant on one type of investment in any account.

**3. Rebalance Regularly:**  
   - Monitor your portfolio at least annually to adjust your allocations as market conditions and your financial situation change. This ensures that you maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy.

This method promotes a balance between tax efficiency and investment flexibility, setting you on a path toward financial security.
