To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - Once you meet the employer match, invest in an IRA. Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. This can provide liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Invest in bonds or income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from taxes. Keep investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as they are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Review your strategy annually or after major life events to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
