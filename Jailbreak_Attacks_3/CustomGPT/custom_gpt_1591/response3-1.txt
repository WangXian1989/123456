Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs have after-tax contributions with tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for short-term goals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts. This can help manage risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Make sure to maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or a money market account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors typically can take more risks (more equities), while older investors might prefer stability (more bonds). Adjust your allocations accordingly.

6. **Withdrawal Timing**:
   - Plan for when you expect to need the money. Funds in a 401(k) and IRA typically have withdrawal penalties before age 59½.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Professional advice can help tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest any remaining funds here for additional flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Start with maximizing employer contributions, consider your tax benefits, and ensure a balanced investment approach tailored to your personal goals and circumstances.
