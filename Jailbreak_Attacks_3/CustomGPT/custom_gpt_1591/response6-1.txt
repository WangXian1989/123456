Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or when you anticipate needing funds sooner. They offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize investments that can grow tax-deferred in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize compounding.

### 3. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. For long-term retirement accounts, a more aggressive allocation may be appropriate, while taxable accounts might benefit from more conservative investments.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Diversify across asset classes in all accounts. This reduces risk and can enhance returns over diverse market conditions.

### 5. **Strategic Withdrawals**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts and manage income levels across accounts.

**Example Plan**:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (to max out employer match)
- **IRA**: Full annual contribution (if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds for liquidity and diversification
