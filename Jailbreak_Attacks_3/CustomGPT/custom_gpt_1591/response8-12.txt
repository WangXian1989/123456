I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and alcohol.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Hydration**: Staying well-hydrated supports liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid buildup for conditions like cirrhosis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver damage is irreversible.
   - **Bile Duct Surgery**: To relieve blockages.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Frequent liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor condition progression.

5. **Supplementation**: Certain vitamins and supplements may be recommended, but consult your doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
