Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions next. This can offer significant tax advantages.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. These can provide flexibility but don't have the same tax advantages.

5. **Considerable Factors**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Investment Choices**: 401(k) plans may offer limited investment options. Ensure you diversify your overall portfolio.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your asset allocation based on market conditions, life changes, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
