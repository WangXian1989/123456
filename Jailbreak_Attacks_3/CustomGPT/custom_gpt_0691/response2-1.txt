Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each type of account to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Match Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (reducing your taxable income), and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out to take advantage of these benefits.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (contributions are made with after-tax dollars, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Limitations & Contributions**: Be aware of the contribution limits and income restrictions for Roth IRAs. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them a good option for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments when you sell. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize turnover and taxes.

### Distribution Strategy:

- **Prioritize Contributions**:
  1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match.
  2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
  3. **Taxable**: Use these accounts for additional savings goals or investments after maxing out retirement accounts.

- **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
  - If you’re far from retirement, you might allocate more to growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
  - As retirement approaches, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

- **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
  - A tax professional can help you strategize contributions based on current and anticipated future tax brackets.

### Keep Reviewing and Adjusting:
Monitor your investments and make adjustments as needed based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and evolving goals.

By balancing these factors in your distribution strategy, you can work towards an efficient and effective allocation of your retirement assets. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
