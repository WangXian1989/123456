The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are a few steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**: Each account has different tax implications. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax advantages but provide liquidity and flexibility.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money that can help boost your retirement savings.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, it’s beneficial to place investments with high expected tax liabilities (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep investments that might be more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks, in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Aim for a well-diversified portfolio that meets your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts. This can help manage risk and enhance returns over the long term.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocations and needs. As you approach retirement or your financial situation changes, you may want to rebalance your portfolio or adjust your contributions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
