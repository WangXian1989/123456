When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general guidelines:

1. **Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing your employer match if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages during the accumulation phase but may be more flexible since you can take withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate funds based on your investment goals—long-term growth vs. short-term needs—and your timeline for each goal. For retirement accounts, you may invest more aggressively since you have a longer time to recover from market fluctuations. For taxable accounts, consider more liquid and less volatile investments if you anticipate needing access soon.

**Suggested Steps**:
- Assess your overall financial goals.
- Prioritize contributions to accounts with employer matches or tax benefits.
- Maintain a diverse portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance across all account types.
