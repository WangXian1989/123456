Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. They typically offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more effectively over time. 

3. **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA if you prefer tax deductions now. 

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high taxable income or for funds you might need in the near future, since these accounts don't have withdrawal penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Some investments may be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, such as bonds and REITs, while stocks may do well in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, your financial goals, and changes in your life situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, itâ€™s always wise to speak with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.

This is a simplified overview, so take your time to consider your unique circumstances!
