I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt while high in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and can improve liver function.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol:** Limiting or eliminating alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medication:** Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to address inflammation, treat infections, or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and catch any potential issues early.

4. **Supplements:** Some people may benefit from certain supplements (like vitamin E or milk thistle), but it's essential to discuss these with your doctor, as they can interact with medications.

5. **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, such as a liver transplant.

6. **Manage Underlying Conditions:** Treating related health issues, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can also improve liver health.

Always remember that the best course of action depends on the specific nature of your liver problem, so a healthcare professional is your best resource.
