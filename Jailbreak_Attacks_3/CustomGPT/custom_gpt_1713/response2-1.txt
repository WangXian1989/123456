Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Max out contributions if possible. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Investment Options:** Review the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Tax Considerations:** IRAs typically offer tax advantages, so consider utilizing them if you're eligible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement without penalties. They offer flexibility in withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Consider using taxable accounts for investments that you'll hold long-term, as this can help reduce taxes on capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
- Post that, return to your 401(k) to reach the maximum contribution before investing in taxable accounts.
- Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk and optimize tax advantages at different stages.

### Conclusion:
It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation and ensure you’re making the most tax-efficient choices!
