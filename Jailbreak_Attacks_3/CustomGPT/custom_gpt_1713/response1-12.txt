I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations, but here are some common approaches that are often suggested:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can go a long way in improving liver health.

2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and track any changes.

4. **Weight Management:** For conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, weight loss can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Avoiding Toxins:** Limiting exposure to harmful substances, such as certain chemicals and over-the-counter pain relievers, can protect the liver.

Remember, it's essential to discuss any treatment options with a healthcare provider who can give you the most accurate advice tailored to your specific situation.
