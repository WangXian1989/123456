When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax advantages, often with employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Can be a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No special tax advantages, but you can access money anytime. Ideal for short-term goals or emergency funds.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA).

### 4. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account (e.g., 401(k) limit for 2024 is $23,000; IRA limit is $6,500).

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks, mutual funds) that benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) to minimize taxes from capital gains.

### 6. **Rebalance as Needed:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure they align with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, whereas taxable account gains are taxed only when realized.

### 8. **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals:**
   - Think about when and how you’ll withdraw funds. Having a mix of accounts allows flexibility in managing your taxable income in retirement.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) to get the match, then use your IRA strategically before moving to taxable accounts. Diversify your investments according to the type of account to optimize tax efficiency. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes. 

It’s also a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
