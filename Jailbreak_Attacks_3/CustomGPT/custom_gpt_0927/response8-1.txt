Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to these accounts, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Both accounts grow tax-deferred, but IRAs often offer more investment options.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Invest in taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner or for goals beyond retirement. This way, you maintain flexibility without penalties that come with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: Keep an eye on your allocation and adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can work toward a balanced and effective investment distribution across your accounts.
