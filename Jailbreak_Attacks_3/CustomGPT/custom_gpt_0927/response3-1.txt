Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Up to the Limit**: Aim to contribute the maximum amount allowed, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide based on your current and expected future tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute the maximum to your IRA as well, leveraging the tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. This can include a more liquid asset allocation.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and municipal bonds, which can yield tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can help you make decisions that are suited to your specific financial situation and goals.

The right distribution strategy can enhance growth potential while managing tax implications, so tailor your approach according to your situation.
