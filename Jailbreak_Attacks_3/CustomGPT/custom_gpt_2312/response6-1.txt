Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Allocate funds across all account types to spread risk and tax exposure.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Selection**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Use a broader selection of investments, including individual stocks or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to mitigate capital gains taxes.

### Final Recommendations
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions and allocations based on market conditions and personal changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can effectively manage your investments to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
