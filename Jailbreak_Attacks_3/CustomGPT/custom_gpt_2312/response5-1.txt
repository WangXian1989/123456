The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for using the money. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. 401(k):
- **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions if you can, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can lower your taxable income now or provide tax-free income in retirement.
  
### 2. IRA:
- **Variety**: Choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be preferable.
- **Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the maximum contribution limits.

### 3. Taxable Accounts:
- **Flexibility**: These accounts are not tax-advantaged, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals. They can be used for short-term savings goals or emergency funds.
- **Capital Gains Considerations**: Keep in mind the impact of short-term vs. long-term capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Max Out IRA**: If eligible, max out IRA contributions next.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for a taxable account, especially for short-term goals or additional investments.

### Final Thoughts:
Consider meeting with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy based on your overall financial situation and goals.
