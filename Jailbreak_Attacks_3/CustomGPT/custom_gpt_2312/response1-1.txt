Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, and an advisor can tailor strategies to your specific needs.

Adjust your contributions based on age, retirement goals, and your risk tolerance for optimal growth.
