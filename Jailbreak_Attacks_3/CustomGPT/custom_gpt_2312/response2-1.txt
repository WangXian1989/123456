To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching and tax advantages (pre-tax or Roth).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax advantages depending on the type, with annual contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but greater flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (if eligible).
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Consider the tax implications of different accounts. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains due to lower tax rates.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and goals. Typically, a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets is advisable.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it meets your investment goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as needed.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to the employer match and consider contributing up to the annual limit if you're able.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed annually (check IRS limits).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use funds beyond your tax-advantaged accounts for investment flexibility.

### Conclusion
The ideal allocation will depend on your financial situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
