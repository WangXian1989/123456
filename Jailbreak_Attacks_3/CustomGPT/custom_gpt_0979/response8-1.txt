To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages. For 401(k)s, especially with employer matching, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Prioritize IRA Types**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider using a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits or a traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a cash reserve in your taxable account for emergencies, which can provide quick access without penalties.
   - **Invest for Goals**: Use your taxable accounts for shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house) or for investments that may generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might want higher risk (equities) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts for tax purposes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Hold Bonds and REITs in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: These generate higher taxable income and can be less efficient in taxable accounts.
   - **Favor Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: Stocks can be more tax-efficient due to the lower tax rate on long-term capital gains.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - **Regular Check-Ins**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure about your specific situation, seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
