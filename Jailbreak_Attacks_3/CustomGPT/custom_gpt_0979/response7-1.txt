Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your immediate financial needs, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k)):
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After maximizing your match, consider maxing out your IRA. The contribution limits for IRAs are typically lower than those for 401(k)s, making it beneficial to take advantage of this account for tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA).

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a good mix of assets across all accounts. Consider different types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Allocate investments with the highest growth potential (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in your taxable accounts, as they can generate interest that might be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement: usually, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA), and leave Roth accounts for last to benefit from tax-free withdrawals later in retirement.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances, as they can provide a personalized plan and ongoing advice.
