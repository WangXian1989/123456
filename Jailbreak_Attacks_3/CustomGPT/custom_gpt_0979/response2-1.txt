Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Benefits**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer match.
- **Contributions**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match (usually 50-100% of your contributions, up to a certain percentage).
- **Investment Choices**: Limited to the options provided by your employer.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, allowing tax-deferred growth.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and whether you qualify for deductible contributions based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.
- **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.
- **Use for Short-term Goals**: Ideal for investments you may need to access within a few years.

### **Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first to take advantage of tax benefits.
2. **Diversify Investments**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that may yield lower capital gains (like long-term index funds).
3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider Roth accounts for tax-free growth.
4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: Long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts; short-term savings should be in taxable accounts for liquidity.
5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your gross income (max up to IRS limits).
- **IRA**: Max contribution in addition to your 401(k) contributions.
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
