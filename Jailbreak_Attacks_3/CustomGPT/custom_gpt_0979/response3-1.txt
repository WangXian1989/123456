Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After securing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This account often has higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute more after the 401(k), consider a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for assets that generate tax-efficient income (like qualified dividends).
   - Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider getting personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can help optimize tax benefits and prepare you for a comfortable retirement. Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve over time.
