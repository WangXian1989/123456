To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should typically be funded after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on profits.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**:
     - Hold investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA).
     - Keep stocks, which can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates, in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Monitor and Adjust Based on Your Goals**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account, adjusting allocations as needed.
   - Regularly review performance and rebalance your portfolio in line with financial goals.

### 4. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, investing more in a Roth account may be beneficial.
   - Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may provide more immediate tax relief.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money effectively among these accounts requires a strategic approach focused on maximizing tax advantages, managing risk, and aligning with your long-term financial goals. Regular reviews and adjustments are key to maintaining an optimal distribution.
