The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. Itâ€™s essentially free money that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Target Tax Advantages:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket, as this can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA:** Contributions to a Traditional IRA may also be tax-deductible, depending on your income level and whether you have access to a 401(k). If you qualify, consider contributing to both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA to enjoy tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment:**
   - **Roth IRA:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing contributions to a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for investments with favorable long-term capital gains tax rates or for holding investments that produce tax-exempt interest.

4. **Consider Your Timeline:** If you are closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts that align with your immediate goals. If you are younger, having a mix of accounts can provide flexibility later on.

5. **Assess Your Investment Choices:** Review the investment options within each account. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might want to maximize contributions to your IRA or taxable account instead.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Periodically reassess your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your long-term financial goals. Life changes such as income, marital status, or financial obligations can impact your strategy.

Ultimately, you may benefit from consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
