Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to maximize your investment growth while considering factors such as taxes, employer matching, and your personal financial goals. Here are some key steps and considerations:

1. **Understand Each Account's Features:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Contributions lower your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages, with Traditional IRAs allowing tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are not tax-advantaged, meaning taxes are paid on dividends, interest, and capital gains. However, they offer flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation and withdrawal needs.
   - After maxing out the employer match and contributing to the IRA, allocate remaining funds to the 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Choose a suitable asset allocation for each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors may take a more aggressive approach, while those closer to retirement may favor more conservative investments.
   - Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shelter them from taxes. Conversely, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be kept in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Understand your current tax bracket and how it may affect the decision to use Traditional vs. Roth IRAs. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be more beneficial.
   - Monitor capital gains and losses in taxable accounts, and use tax-loss harvesting to offset any taxable gains.

5. **Tiered Strategy:**
   - Create a tiered investment strategy, where the 401(k) provides the base retirement savings, the IRA adds another layer, and taxable accounts serve as flexibility for both short-term and long-term savings.

6. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Annually or semi-annually review your allocations and contributions to ensure alignment with your evolving financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and manage your tax liabilities effectively.
