Distributing your money among your retirement accounts and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines that may help you strategize your distributions:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, prioritize these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. However, they provide flexibility as you can access funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Consider your age and when you plan to retire. Younger investors might prefer growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may shift toward more conservative investments.
   - If you have a higher risk tolerance, you might allocate more towards equities in your taxable accounts, but keep some cash or safer investments in your retirement accounts for stability.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocation among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable account to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level. 

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. You can diversify by asset class (stocks, bonds) and geographically (domestic, international).

6. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Always keep your long-term financial goals in mind. Your distribution should align with your retirement objectives, whether that's aggressive growth, income generation, or capital preservation in retirement.

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your unique financial situation.
