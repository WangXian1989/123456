The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here is a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRAs:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between these depends on your current and expected future tax rates:
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Maximize 401(k):** After fully funding your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) to the maximum allowable limit. This will provide you with tax advantages, as pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals or Flexibility:** If you have additional funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for financial goals that are shorter-term.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. This means balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investing:** In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes. This could include index funds, ETFs, or tax-exempt municipal bonds.

7. **Revisit Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your distributions based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and retirement goals. 

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and situation.
