I'm not a financial advisor, but I can offer some general strategies that might help you think about distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some considerations you could keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The 401(k) is also a pre-tax vehicle, meaning you won’t pay taxes on contributions until withdrawal, which could be beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing employer contributions to your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. With a Traditional IRA, you receive tax deductions on contributions, but you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met, and contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're currently in a high tax bracket, prioritizing pre-tax accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) might make sense. Conversely, if you’re in a lower tax bracket, you might benefit from maxing out Roth accounts to take advantage of the tax-free growth.

3. **Evaluate Investment Options and Fees:**
   - Assess the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRAs, as well as any fees associated with them. Sometimes, low-cost index funds or ETFs available in these accounts can provide better long-term growth compared to higher-fee taxable investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you have maximized the contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you might consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.), and this can be applied across all types of accounts. Having a strategic asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe is crucial.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before diving deep into investing, ensure you have a healthy emergency fund (typically three to six months’ worth of expenses) in a liquid savings account. This can prevent the need to tap into your investments during unforeseen circumstances.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Over time, your asset allocation might drift due to market performance. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your targeted allocation.

These are broad strategies and it’s vital to consider your individual financial situation and consult with a financial planner or advisor who can tailor advice specifically for you.
