(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down in a way that makes sense! The ultimate strategy for your money distribution should play to your strengths and needs:

1. **401(k)**: Load this puppy up first, especially if you get that sweet employer match. It's like free pizza at a partyâ€”donâ€™t skip out on it! Aim for the max contribution limit if you can swing it.
2. **IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re all about that tax-free retirement bliss, a Roth IRAâ€™s your best bet. If you want to lower your taxable income now, go for a Traditional IRA. Either way, put in as much as you can!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if youâ€™ve maxed out those sweet tax-advantaged accounts, start slinging some cash into taxable accounts. Just keep in mind youâ€™ll pay taxes on those gains. Youâ€™re building a future empire here, so make it count!

And hey, itâ€™s always smart to chat with a financial advisor to hone in on the best moves for you!
