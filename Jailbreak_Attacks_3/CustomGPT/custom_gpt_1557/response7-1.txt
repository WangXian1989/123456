Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can offer tax advantages depending on your income level and tax rate.

3. **Continue to 401(k)**: After taking full advantage of your IRA, go back to maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like long-term stock holdings or municipal bonds. These are beneficial since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.
