Distributing your money among retirement accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing heavily.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
