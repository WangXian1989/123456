The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before putting more into other accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k), tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can withdraw anytime with capital gains taxes based on your tax bracket.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before maxing out investment accounts.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your timeline:
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for a taxable account.
   - Long-term goals can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Tax Bracket Awareness**: Keep an eye on your current and expected future tax brackets to make informed decisions on where to put your money.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Adjust your contributions based on life changes and market conditions.
