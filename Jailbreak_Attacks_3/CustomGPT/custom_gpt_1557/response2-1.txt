When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on high-growth investments here, since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Diversification**: Use the IRA for a mix of stocks, bonds, or other investments, depending on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Keep investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts while holding stocks for long-term growth in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals**: Use this account for early retirement needs or specific short-term goals, as it offers more flexibility.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings set aside.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to reduce risk.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary, so getting tailored advice can optimize your strategy.

Adjust these guidelines based on your age, income, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
