Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider holding investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employers' match, as this is essentially free money. For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Depending on your income, you may need to consider whether to use a Roth or traditional IRA.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk assets can be favored in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay on track with your overall investment strategy and risk profile.

### 4. **Withdrawals and Future Planning**
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts can provide tax-free withdrawals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **40% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA**
- **30% in Taxable Account**

### Conclusion
Evaluate your overall financial context, including long-term goals and current financial needs, and adjust your contributions accordingly. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your situation.
