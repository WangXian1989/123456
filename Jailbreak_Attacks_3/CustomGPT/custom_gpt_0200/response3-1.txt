Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. This is useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility, especially for short-term goals. Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is far off, focus on tax-advantaged accounts. As you near retirement, shift toward more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly assess and adjust your contributions and allocations based on market performance and life changes.

By following these steps, you can optimize your savings across these different accounts efficiently.
