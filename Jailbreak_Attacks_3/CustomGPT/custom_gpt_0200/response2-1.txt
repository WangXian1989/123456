The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income tax rate, prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexible access to funds without penalties.

4. **Adjust for Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax consequences on interest income.
   - Use taxable accounts for stocks to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons can tolerate more risk, so allocate more to equities, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversify**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) and diversify within those classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio according to your changing goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
