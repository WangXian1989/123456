To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then the maximum limit if possible for tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k), focusing on tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and accessibility.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across accounts to balance risk and return.
   - Keep high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.

This approach blends tax efficiency with flexibility, optimizing your overall investment strategy.
