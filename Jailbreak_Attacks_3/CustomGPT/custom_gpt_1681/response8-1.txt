Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** These accounts allow for tax deferment on contributions and growth, making them advantageous if you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is great if you think tax rates will rise.

### 3. **Allocate for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Investments here can be taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments by asset class (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your accounts regularly and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, or financial goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount 
- **Taxable Account:** Contribute remaining funds, focusing on liquidity and tax efficiency

### Conclusion
Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
