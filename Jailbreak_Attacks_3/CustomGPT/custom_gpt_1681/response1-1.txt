Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time and are good for short-term goals. Consider placing investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that youâ€™re diversifying your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate how your contributions affect your tax situation. Sometimes, contributing to a taxable account could provide strategic tax advantages.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
