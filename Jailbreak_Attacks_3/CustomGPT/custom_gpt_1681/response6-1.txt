Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Taxes**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Asset Location:** Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds:** Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for higher-risk assets (like stocks) and consider bonds or income-producing assets for taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to manage your tax bracket strategically.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals and Time Horizon**
   - If you’re young, prioritize growth in 401(k) and Roth IRA. As retirement approaches, shift to more conservative investments.

By understanding your current situation and future needs, you can effectively balance your investments for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
