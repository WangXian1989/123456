Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax strategy. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or long-term capital gains. Consider keeping bonds or actively traded stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts based on your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy. Balance growth and income-generating assets to meet your long-term goals.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocations and adjust as necessary, especially as you near retirement or when significant life events occur.

### General Allocation Example:
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 10-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30%
- **Emergency Savings**: 3-6 months of expenses
