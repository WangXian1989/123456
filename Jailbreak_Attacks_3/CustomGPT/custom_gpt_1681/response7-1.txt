When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider a few key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing any employer match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional & Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement after contributions are taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these for more flexible access to funds without penalties.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize tax benefits.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth (like retirement), you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Shorter-term savings might be better suited in taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in long-term accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Allocate across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full match if available.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: Choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax bracket and expected future income.
- **Invest Beyond Contributions**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged contributions, use your taxable account for additional investments, keeping in mind tax implications.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: Max out to receive full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use remaining funds to invest, focusing on tax-efficient funds (index funds, ETFs).

This approach helps balance tax benefits while considering liquidity and your overall investment strategy. Always review your situation with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
