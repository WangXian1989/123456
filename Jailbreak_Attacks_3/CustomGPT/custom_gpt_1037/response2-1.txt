Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a structured breakdown to help you navigate this decision:

### Module 1: Understanding Each Account Type

1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Employer Match:** Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money."
   - **Withdrawal Rules:** Withdrawals are taxed as income and can incur penalties if taken before age 59½.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types:** There are Traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth IRAs (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Lower than 401(k) limits, but offers more investment flexibility.
   - **Withdrawal Rules:** Similar to a 401(k) for Traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals of contributions at any time.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits and you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications:** Capital gains taxes apply on profits when you sell investments, which can be higher than the tax rates for retirement accounts.

### Module 2: Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to capture the full employer match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is often the best return on investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider putting funds in an IRA (preferably a Roth if you qualify) for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - If you have significant savings needs, consider Traditional IRAs for potential pre-tax growth.

3. **Allocate Excess to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. This can help with liquidity and access to funds for short-term goals.

### Module 3: Key Considerations

- **Investment Horizon:** The longer your investment horizon, the more you can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Your risk tolerance might influence how aggressively you invest across accounts.
- **Tax Implications:** Understand your current and future tax brackets to maximize tax efficiency.
  
### Key Takeaways

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k).
2. **Consider IRAs Next:** Focus on either Traditional or Roth IRAs based on your tax situation.
3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** After maxing out tax-advantaged options.
