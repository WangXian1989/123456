Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of factors such as tax implications, financial goals, and investment horizons. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you navigate this decision:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with possible employer matching. Contributions are often pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Contribution limits are generally lower than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment accounts that allow buying and selling without tax advantages, subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to the 401(k) up to any employer match (often considered "free money").
   - Contribute to your IRA, considering both traditional and Roth options, based on your income limits and tax situation.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term**: Funds needed in the next few years may be better placed in a taxable account for easier access.
   - **Long-Term**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings, as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and optimize growth.
   - Balance taxable accounts for liquidity and taxes owed on gains; consider tax-efficient investments.

### 5. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. This may involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all account types.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your retirement horizon.

### 6. **Visualizing Distribution - Example Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: 50% of total contributions. 
   - **IRA**: 30% of total contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 20% for liquidity and flexibility.

### 7. **Reassess and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly revisit your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Key Takeaways
- Start with employer 401(k) contributions for the match.
- Use IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings.
- Maintain a portion in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
- Re-evaluate your allocations periodically based on your financial situation and goals.
