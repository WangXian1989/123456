Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and align with your long-term financial goals. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and some key considerations for allocation:

### Module 1: Understanding Account Types

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Benefits:** Offer pre-tax contributions, lower taxable income, and potential employer match.
   - **Withdrawal Rules:** Penalties for early withdrawals (before age 59½) and mandatory distributions after age 72 (for traditional 401(k)s).

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) but with generally lower contribution limits; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Withdrawal Rules:** Early withdrawal penalties apply to traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs have more flexible withdrawal rules.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Benefits:** No contribution limits, easy access to funds, and potential for capital gains and dividend income.
   - **Tax Implications:** Investments incur taxes on capital gains and dividends, potentially leading to higher tax bills compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Module 2: Strategies for Distribution

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, focus on maxing out a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA to defer taxes until retirement.

3. **Utilize Roth Accounts for Tax-Free Growth:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Balance Taxable Account Investments:**
   - Keep investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as they typically incur lower tax rates. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Module 3: Example Allocation Strategy

1. **Age-Based Approach:**
   - For those younger (under 50): 
     - 50% in 401(k),
     - 30% in IRA (with a focus on Roth if income allows),
     - 20% in taxable accounts.
   - For those closer to retirement:
     - 30% in 401(k),
     - 30% in IRA (balance between traditional and Roth),
     - 40% in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Key Takeaways

- **Diversify Account Types:** Utilize all three account types to balance tax efficiency and growth.
- **Adjust Over Time:** Review your allocation as income, tax brackets, and retirement goals change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A personalized financial plan tailored to your specific situation can be invaluable.
