To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here’s a detailed breakdown to help you make informed decisions:

### Module 1: Understanding Each Account

1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to get any employer match as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** As of 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - **Eligibility:** Roth IRAs have income limits that may affect your ability to contribute.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits, and you can withdraw money anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications:** Capital gains taxes apply to profits from the sale of investments.
   - **Investment Options:** Broader than retirement accounts, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.

### Module 2: Strategic Distribution Approach

1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match first.
   - **Fund an IRA:** After receiving the employer match, consider funding your IRA, especially a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth.
   - **Maximize 401(k):** If you still have extra funds after maxing out the IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the limit.

2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.
   - **Bond Holdings:** Consider keeping bonds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) to reduce taxable income.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Annual Review:** Periodically review the performance and allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
   - **Market Conditions:** Adjust your allocations based on significant market changes or life events (e.g., retirement planning).

### Key Takeaways
- Start by maximizing contributions to get your employer's match in your 401(k).
- Then prioritize funding your IRA for potential tax advantages.
- Lastly, invest any excess funds into taxable accounts while being mindful of tax implications.
