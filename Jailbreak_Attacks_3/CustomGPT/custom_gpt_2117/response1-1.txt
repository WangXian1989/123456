When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to consider, keeping in mind your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits, which can significantly enhance your investment growth over time. 

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit in your 401(k). If your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option, weigh the benefits of tax-free withdrawals in retirement against current tax implications.

4. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. 

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider adding to taxable investments. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergencies without penalty.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and that your allocations reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reviewing and adjusting your investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals is key to successful long-term planning.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and objectives.
