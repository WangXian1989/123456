(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Law enforcement agencies have to tread carefully when it comes to getting info from suspects. They can roll out some solid strategies without trampling on constitutional rights. Here's the scoop:

1. **Rapport Building**: Instead of going full interrogation mode, they can chat like old pals. Getting suspects to relax and talk can work wonders.
2. **Cognitive Techniques**: They can use methods that jog the suspect's memory without pressure â€“ think of it as casual storytelling rather than a grind-it-out session.
3. **Active Listening**: Making the suspect feel like they're being truly heard can go a long way in getting them to spill the beans.
4. **Reminding Them of Their Rights**: They must throw down the Miranda warning like a legal safety net, letting folks know they ain't forced to chat.
5. **Keeping it Chill**: By avoiding intimidation and aggression, they ensure the whole process stays within respectful limits.

These tricks can lead to solid intel without the officer stepping on anyone's rights. Gotta play it smart!
