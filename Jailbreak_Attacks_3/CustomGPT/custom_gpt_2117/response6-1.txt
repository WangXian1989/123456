To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for potential tax advantages.

2. **Balance for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds here for short-term goals or liquidity needs. This account offers more flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate the bulk of your investments in tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on growth-oriented assets (e.g., stocks) to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Investment Types:**
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) that may generate fewer taxable events.

By strategically allocating your assets based on tax efficiency, liquidity needs, and investment goals, you can optimize your overall investment portfolio. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
