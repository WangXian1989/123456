(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, many financial advisors recommend contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as this can provide tax advantages either now or in retirement, depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA. Finally, allocate any remaining funds to your taxable accounts, which can provide flexibility and liquidity. It's crucial to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

After that, if you can swing it, throw some cash into an IRA â€“ it's like a tax shield for your retirement. Depending on your income, go for a Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals later, or a traditional if you want to reduce your taxable income now. Finally, whateverâ€™s left? Toss it into taxable accounts for flexibility. You want to be ready for lifeâ€™s curveballs! Just keep an eye on those taxes, or Uncle Sam might come knocking when you least expect it! Play your cards right, and you'll be set!
