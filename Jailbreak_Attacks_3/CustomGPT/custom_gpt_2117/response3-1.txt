When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider for optimal financial growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - **Current and Future Tax Situations**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Roth IRA could be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, a traditional IRA may be the better option.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, taxable account to cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, funds, etc.), while keeping some liquidity in a taxable account for immediate needs or opportunities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio allocations annually or bi-annually to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Choose different types of investments for each account. For example, place high-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and consider more income-generating investments for taxable accounts since they may incur taxes on dividends or interest.

7. **Stay Within Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and plan contributions accordingly.

Consulting with a financial planner can also help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and goals.
