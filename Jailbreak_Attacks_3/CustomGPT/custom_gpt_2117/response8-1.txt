The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations to help guide your decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.
   - Consider contributing the maximum limit if possible, as these accounts have tax advantages (pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income).

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. 
   - A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term goals or emergencies since they are easily accessible without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize tax implications. Typically, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and then Roth accounts last due to their tax advantages.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking to a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Developing a balanced approach considering tax implications, your retirement timeline, and goals is key to effective distribution.
