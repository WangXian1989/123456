Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later. If you want immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA may be better.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and ensure you’re taking advantage of these opportunities.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer more liquidity without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments like index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income than actively managed funds.

### General Strategies
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly check your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.
- **Tax Considerations**: Keep track of your tax situation and adjust contributions based on changing circumstances or tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Aggressive Growth Focus**: If you’re young and aiming for growth, you might prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and contribute to a Roth IRA, using taxable accounts for additional investments.
- **Balanced Approach**: If you have near-term goals, consider a mix of contributions to all three, balancing immediate access with tax-advantaged growth.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your individual financial situation and goals.
