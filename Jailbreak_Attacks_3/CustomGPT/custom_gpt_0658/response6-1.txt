Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several key factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timelines. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Maximize contributions to an IRA to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if your income is eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts, such as specific stocks or bonds.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Focus on maxing out tax-deferred accounts first (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you are currently in a higher tax bracket, as they reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Tax Diversification:** Have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to give flexibility in retirement withdrawals and tax strategies.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place your higher growth investments in your 401(k) and IRAs to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Use index funds and ETFs that typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.
   - **Stay Flexible:** Adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your asset allocation among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively. It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
