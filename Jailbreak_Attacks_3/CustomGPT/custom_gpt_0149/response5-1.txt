Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Strategies**:
   - Fund your 401(k) and IRAs first for tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Balance Growth and Accessibility**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding without immediate tax impacts.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments you may need to access earlier.

4. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can optimize your specific situation considering factors like income, retirement plans, and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investment accounts.
