It's essential to approach distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, prioritize contributing enough to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money. Generally, you can contribute up to $20,500 (or $27,000 if you're over 50) in 2022. Consider adding more if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can also be a suitable place to save for retirement. You can contribute up to $6,000 (or $7,000 if you're over 50) annually. An IRA might be preferable if you want more investment options compared to a 401(k). Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current and expected future tax situations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any money not allocated to tax-advantaged accounts can be distributed into taxable investment accounts. These accounts don’t have the same tax benefits, but they provide excellent flexibility. Capital gains taxes apply, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to mitigate risk. This can include stocks, bonds, and other asset types.

5. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your investment allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone’s financial situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor who can offer personalized guidance based on your goals and circumstances.

Balancing your contributions across these accounts can help you build a robust retirement strategy while maximizing tax efficiency.
