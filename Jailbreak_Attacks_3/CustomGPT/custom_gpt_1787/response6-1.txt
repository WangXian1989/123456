To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following points:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income; taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t offer immediate tax benefits, but investment gains are taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs to benefit from compounding growth and potential employer matches.
   - **Short-term goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for accessibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider fully funding an IRA (especially if eligible for a Roth IRA) for tax-free growth.
- **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investment beyond the limits of tax-advantaged accounts or to maintain liquidity.

Overall, the ideal strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
