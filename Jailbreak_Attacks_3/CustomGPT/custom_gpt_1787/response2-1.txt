The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation). IRAs typically have more investment options and may provide tax advantages.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve contributed to an IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, especially if you’re under 50 and can contribute more.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate income (like bonds or certain stocks) because they can lead to higher taxes. Consider holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in these accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts. If you anticipate a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts might be more beneficial.

7. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

8. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and your financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
