I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment options. Depending on the specific liver condition, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol can help reduce liver strain. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the liver issue, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track the liver's health over time.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease often require targeted therapies to address the root cause.

5. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage and promote healing.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgical interventions might be necessary.

Always seek professional medical advice for specific guidance regarding your health situation.
