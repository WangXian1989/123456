When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to think about factors such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Then, consider contributing up to the maximum limit if it makes sense for your financial situation. This account allows for pre-tax contributions (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, you can contribute to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it’s beneficial to max out this account since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility and access to funds (with potential capital gains tax implications). You're able to pick more liquid investments without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. A common approach is to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts, as you will be less taxed on long-term capital gains in the latter.

5. **Regular Review**: Continually review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation. They can provide tailored strategies, especially concerning tax implications and the best investment vehicles for your goals.
