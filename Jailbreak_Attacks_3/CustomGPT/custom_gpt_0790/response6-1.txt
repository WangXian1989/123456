To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, focusing on tax-deferred accounts like a traditional IRA or 401(k) can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - If you're expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments in a way that aligns with your risk tolerance. Generally, place higher-risk investments in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts to allow for potential growth without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those subject to lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Regular Contributions and Reassessments**:
   - Consistently contribute to all accounts while periodically reassessing your portfolio allocation based on shifts in financial goals, market conditions, or life changes.

5. **Consider State Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the state taxes that may apply to withdrawals from different accounts, especially if you plan to relocate in retirement.

By following these strategies, you can allocate your money efficiently across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for growth while managing tax implications.
