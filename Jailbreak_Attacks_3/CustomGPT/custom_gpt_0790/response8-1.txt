Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline to help you strategize:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) if available. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short- to mid-term financial goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you might want to hold more growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and consider holding more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, favor tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs, and consider holding bonds and high-turnover stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as your financial situation or market conditions change. 

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these guidelines to your specific situation and goals.
