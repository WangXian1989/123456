To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching. Focus on maximizing contributions to take advantage of matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs provide tax advantages—traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax rate vs. your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or investments that may not fit into retirement accounts. Taxable accounts don’t have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. Contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you qualify and expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding your taxable account for more flexibility.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Choose a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance, age, and time horizon. Younger investors might prefer more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative choices.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your money distribution for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
