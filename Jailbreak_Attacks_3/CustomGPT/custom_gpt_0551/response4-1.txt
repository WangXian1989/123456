The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Traditional or Roth IRAs**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Best if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Suitable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term goals and provide flexibility, but they may have tax implications on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure you have a suitable mix of investments across your accounts, reflecting your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while keeping tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market changes, and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
The right strategy will vary based on individual circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment distribution to your specific needs and goals.
