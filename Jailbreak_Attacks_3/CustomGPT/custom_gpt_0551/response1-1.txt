The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them, which may be beneficial if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be ideal if you expect a higher tax rate in the future.

3. **Look at Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: May have limited investment choices, so ensure they align with your strategy.
   - **IRA**: Often offers a broader range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across accounts are balanced and diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that taxable accounts can offer more liquidity compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to account for changes in market conditions and your personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
