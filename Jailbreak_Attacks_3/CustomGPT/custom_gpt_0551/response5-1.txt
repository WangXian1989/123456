The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any company match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA before taxable accounts.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made post-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Tax-efficient Investing**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts before maxing out contributions.

### 5. **Long-term Goals and Withdrawals**
   - Consider how and when you'll need access to the funds. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for short-term needs.

### 6. **Regular Reviews**
   - Revisit your strategy periodically, especially if life circumstances change (e.g., job changes, market shifts).

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
