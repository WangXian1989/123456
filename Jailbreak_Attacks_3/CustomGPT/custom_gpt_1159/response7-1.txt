To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Individual retirement account with potential tax advantages. Can be a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible, subject to capital gains tax. Useful for short-term goals and cash needs.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Prioritize employer matching in your 401(k) to maximize free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions once you've met your 401(k) match.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Use both stocks and bonds for balance.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (index funds or ETFs).
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate interest income tax.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly revisit your allocation as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while minimizing taxes, aligning with your long-term financial goals.
