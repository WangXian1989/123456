Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Contribute to these first for tax benefits. Growth is tax-deferred, which can compound wealth more efficiently.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can hold investments that produce capital gains or qualified dividends, which are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts for better risk management.

4. **Investment Type**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to leverage lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

5. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, prioritize growth in tax-deferred accounts.
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting some assets to taxable accounts for easier access.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Everyone’s situation is unique. A financial advisor can tailor recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

Creating a balanced approach tailored to your needs is key to effective wealth management.
