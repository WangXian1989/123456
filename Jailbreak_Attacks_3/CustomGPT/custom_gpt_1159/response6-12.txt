I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and rich in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a tailored approach.
