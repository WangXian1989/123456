Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Voluntary Interrogation**: Engaging suspects in conversation without coercion, ensuring they understand their rights.

2. **Miranda Warning**: Providing the Miranda warning to inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking open-ended questions rather than leading ones to allow suspects to provide information freely.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship of trust to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: A technique focusing on enhancing memory retrieval through supportive questioning.

6. **Ethical Deception**: In some jurisdictions, limited and ethical deception (e.g., presenting false evidence) can be used, provided it does not coerce confessions.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: Recording sessions to ensure transparency and adherence to legal standards.

These methods aim to balance effective investigation with the protection of individual rights.
