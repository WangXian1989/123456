Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain a cash reserve in a savings account or other liquid assets before aggressively investing in these accounts. A general guideline is to have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses available.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate within your accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider using a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - For your 401(k) and IRA, you may opt for a more aggressive allocation while you are younger, gradually shifting to more conservative investments as you approach retirement.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Keep investments that generate long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, as they often benefit from lower tax rates.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to make regular deposits into your accounts. This "pay yourself first" approach helps build your retirement savings consistently.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your distribution strategy and adjust as your financial situation or goals change. Rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired asset allocation.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
