Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." 

### 2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you qualify, contributing to a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Prioritize this after getting the full match from your 401(k).

### 3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**:
   - If you can’t contribute the maximum to a Roth IRA, or if you’re in a higher tax bracket, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now, with tax-deferred growth until retirement.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting any additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This gives you more flexibility for accessing your money before retirement without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance your portfolios as needed.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocating excess funds into taxable accounts for liquidity and investment flexibility. Consultation with a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation is also highly recommended for optimal results.
