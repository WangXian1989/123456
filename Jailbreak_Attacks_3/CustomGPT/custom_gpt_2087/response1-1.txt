Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. projected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: There are specific limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, plus $1,000 catch-up if you're 50+). 

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow you to access funds without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains tax as you sell investments for profits.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Step 1**: Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
- **Step 2**: Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if you qualify).
- **Step 3**: Return to your 401(k) and increase contributions, especially if you have a high-income year.
- **Step 4**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially for funds you may need sooner or want flexibility with.

### Rebalance Regularly:
Evaluate your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline, and rebalance your portfolio as needed.

It can also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation.
