To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Max out employer matching contributions. The limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Aim to contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are ideal for investments you plan to access before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Focus on higher-growth investments (stocks), as these will benefit most from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax and consider holding bonds here to offset higher tax rates.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for when to withdraw from each account type, prioritizing tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement.
   - Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By balancing contributions and strategically allocating investments, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
