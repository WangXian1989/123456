Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, prioritize contributions to traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - If you anticipate being in the same or a higher bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRA contributions, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those that generate income (like bonds), where tax implications can be managed.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep an emergency fund in a taxable account to cover unexpected expenses without penalties.
   - Consider your time horizon for different goals: short-term savings can be in taxable accounts, while long-term investments can go into retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your investment strategy and goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income (max out to employer match)
- **IRA**: $6,500 (for 2023; $7,500 if 50 or older)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds based on liquidity needs and goals

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances. They can provide insights on tax implications and investment options.
