To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA) after your 401(k) maxes out any match. Tax-advantaged accounts allow for tax-free growth or tax deduction benefits.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, for instance, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50+).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner. They provide liquidity but are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account type. Typically, place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize your savings for growth and minimize tax liability.
