To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize maxing out employer match contributions. This provides an immediate return on investment.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, use a traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or long-term capital gains.

### 2. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a cash reserve in your taxable account for emergencies. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Include stocks, bonds, and real estate to balance risk and return.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, followed by tax-deferred accounts, to minimize taxes over time.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio annually to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Fees**
   - Be mindful of fees associated with your 401(k) and IRAs. Opt for low-cost index funds where possible.

### 7. **Future Goals**
   - Align your strategy with your time horizon and retirement goals. Younger investors may focus more on growth, while those nearing retirement should prioritize stability.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** 30%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable:** 40%

Adjust percentages based on your individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
