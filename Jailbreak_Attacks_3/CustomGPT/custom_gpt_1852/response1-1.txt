Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Focus on Investments**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or income-generating assets, as they may be taxed at lower rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep 3-6 months of living expenses in liquid, easily accessible savings, separate from these accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Look at investment fees in your 401(k) versus IRAs and taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
