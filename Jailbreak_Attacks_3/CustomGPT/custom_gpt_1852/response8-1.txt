Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free growth) based on your current and future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider funding a taxable account for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider holding higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to help manage taxes on capital gains.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment performance and adjust allocations as needed to stay aligned with your goals and market changes.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
