Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's “free money”).
   - **IRA**: Aim to fully fund your IRA if eligible, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (that could result in higher capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure you have enough in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as these funds are more accessible.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. 

### Conclusion
- **Overall Strategy**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate remaining funds into taxable accounts based on your financial goals and liquidity needs. Adjust as necessary to maintain diversification and liquidity.
