I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver disease, losing weight can improve liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be recommended to track liver function.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, particularly for chronic liver disease, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
