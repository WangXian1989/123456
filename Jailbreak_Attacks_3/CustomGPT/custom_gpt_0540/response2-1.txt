Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 annually ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to reach the contribution limit. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** If you still have funds after maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Investments in a 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs and taxable accounts can grow tax-free or with capital gains taxes. Diversifying across accounts can provide tax efficiency.

6. **Asset Allocation and Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are favored in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while more stable investments may be appropriate for taxable accounts.

7. **Review Annually:** Periodically reassess your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation is always a wise move.
