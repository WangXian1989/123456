I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized plan. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring through blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and detect any worsening of the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a nutritionist can help tailor a diet that supports liver health.

Again, please consult a healthcare provider for a treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
