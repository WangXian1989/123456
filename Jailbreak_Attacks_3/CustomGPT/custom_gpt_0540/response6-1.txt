Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: After maxing out or contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. This depends on your eligibility and tax strategy.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Pre-Tax vs. After-Tax Contributions**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account type. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility but are taxed differently than retirement accounts.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep enough liquid cash in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs, ensuring you don’t have to withdraw from retirement accounts early.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Balance the risk across all accounts. Use retirement accounts for long-term, growth-oriented investments while using taxable accounts for more liquid, short-term investments.

### Example Allocation
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA: 30%
- Taxable Account: 20%

This approach maximizes growth potential while considering your financial goals and tax implications. Adjust the percentages based on your personal circumstances and investment strategy.
