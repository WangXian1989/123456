Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here's a general approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and high contribution limits.
- **IRA:** Offers tax advantages (traditional for tax-deferred growth, Roth for tax-free withdrawals); lower contribution limits than 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts:** More flexible with no contribution limits, but you pay taxes on gains and dividends.

### 2. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Consider maxing out IRA contributions next, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. Diversify Investment Types
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) as these accounts are for long-term growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) or investments that generate qualified dividends (which are taxed at a lower rate).

### 4. Assess Your Goals and Timeline
- If you plan to withdraw funds in the short term, prioritize liquid assets in taxable accounts.
- For long-term growth, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on life changes (marriage, kids, retirement) and market conditions.

### General Recommendation
1. **Max out your 401(k) to the match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA.**
3. **Put additional funds in your taxable accounts.**
