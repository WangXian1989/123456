To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Since you'll pay taxes on withdrawals, consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets here to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates. Consider holding stocks here for potential tax advantages.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This ensures that no one account becomes disproportionately weighted in a particular investment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - When it comes time to withdraw funds (e.g., retirement), consider which accounts to draw from based on tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Depending on your situation, a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to meet your financial goals.

Always review your specific financial situation, goals, and tax implications before making decisions.
