Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older. Contribute as much as you can up to these limits, especially if youâ€™re in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide based on your current tax rate. Traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500, or $7,500 for those 50 and older. Try to reach these limits if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them a good option for short-term needs.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, as they generate fewer capital gains compared to actively managed funds.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors to reduce risk. Different accounts may hold different types of investments based on their tax treatment.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k)/IRA), followed by tax-free (Roth IRA) to potentially minimize your tax burden over time.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. They can help you align your investment distribution with your overall financial goals.
