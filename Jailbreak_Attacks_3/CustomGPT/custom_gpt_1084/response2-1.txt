Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, you might prefer a Traditional IRA or 401(k) for the immediate tax deduction.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across different types of accounts. For example, you might hold more growth-oriented investments in Roth accounts (for tax-free growth) and income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Location:**
   - Place assets that are subject to higher taxes (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts. Stocks, which can benefit from capital gains tax rates, can go in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Make regular contributions to all accounts to build wealth over time. Automatic contributions can help ensure consistency.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - As you approach retirement, strategize how you'll withdraw funds from each account. Different accounts have different rules regarding withdrawals and taxes.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Individual circumstances vary, so consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor for a plan tailored to your situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income to receive the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions each year.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any surplus after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

By balancing contributions while considering tax implications and growth potential, you can create a sound investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
