To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth over time.
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Risk Tolerance Adjustment:** Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on capital gains. Use more stable investments in your taxable accounts, which might be subject to immediate taxes.
   - **Debt Consideration:** If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it down before investing heavily, as the interest costs can outweigh investment gains.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Plan for Retirement:** In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow. This can minimize your tax burden over time.

### 4. **Consider Future Tax Implications**
   - **Roth Options:** If available, consider Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k) options for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

### 5. **Periodic Rebalancing**
   - **Review and Adjust:** Regularly assess your asset allocation and performance. Adjust your contributions based on investment performance and changing financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax implications over time.
