To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

2. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - Consider location optimizationâ€”place more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

By balancing your contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your overall financial strategy.
