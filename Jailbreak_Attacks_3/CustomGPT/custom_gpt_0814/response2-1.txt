The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Further 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) beyond the employer match. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investment options, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts, considering the tax implications of both.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be strategic with withdrawals. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, opt for tax-deferred accounts first. In retirement, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, you may withdraw from taxable accounts last.

7. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your investment and contribution strategy as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your needs and goals.
