To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a match. Aim for the maximum allowable contribution to gain the full benefit of any employer match.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k), consider your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Allocate a diversified mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher growth investments typically make sense in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, which are more tax-efficient. Consider holding bonds or high dividend-paying stocks in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance each account to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation:

- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

This allocation can vary based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time until retirement. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
