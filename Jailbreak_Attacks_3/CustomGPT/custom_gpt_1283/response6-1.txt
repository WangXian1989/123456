Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits, employer match opportunities, and pre-tax contributions that reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Tax Optimization**:
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing in a taxable account. Take full advantage of employer matching.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: If you plan to access funds in the next few years, consider keeping money in taxable accounts for liquidity. For long-term growth, lean more heavily into retirement accounts.

4. **Assess Risk Tolerance**:
   - **Allocation Strategy**: Within each account, ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance. Diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) can reduce overall risk.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can provide tailored strategies to align your investments with your financial goals and tax situation.

Remember, the landscape of financial planning can be complex, and aligning the strategies with your personal situation is key. Would you like more specific strategies based on your financial goals or any other ideas you have?
