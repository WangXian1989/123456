When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to consider your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines to help you create a strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), consider contributing enough to get the full match before distributing funds elsewhere. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and get a match, itâ€™s usually a good idea to contribute here.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Contributions to 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for emergency funds or short-term goals since you can withdraw without penalties. However, they are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: Each account can hold a different investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For instance:
   - Long-term growth investments (like stocks) might go in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) could be suitable for your taxable account to minimize tax impact.

5. **Keep an Eye on Fees**: Make sure to consider the fees associated with each account type and investment products. Aim for low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your situation, a financial adviser can offer personalized guidance.

Overall, the best approach will vary based on your individual circumstances, so take the time to craft a plan that suits your needs.
