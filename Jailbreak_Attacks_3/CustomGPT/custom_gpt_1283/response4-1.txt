When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors including your long-term financial goals, tax implications, and your current financial situation. Here's a general approach you could take:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k):** Contributing to a traditional 401(k) can provide you with tax advantages, as your contributions are typically made pre-tax.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA is also a good option for tax deferral.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it may be beneficial to focus on Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) where you pay taxes now rather than in retirement.

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment:** It's often beneficial to have a mix of tax-advantaged and taxable accounts. This can give you flexibility in retirement when it comes to managing tax liabilities.

5. **Calculate Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and strive to maximize your contributions within these limits.

6. **Evaluate Your Current Needs and Goals:** Consider your liquidity needs, investment time horizon, and your risk tolerance when distributing your money. You may want to keep a portion of your funds in taxable accounts for easier access if needed.

7. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your long-term goals, especially as market conditions and your personal circumstances change.

A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation, so you may want to consult one for tailored advice.

Remember, the best strategy depends on your individual circumstances, so it's important to personalize any advice to your situation.
