When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, with similar tax implications upon withdrawal as a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from investments are subject to capital gains taxes, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates depending on how long you hold the assets.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These are typically for long-term growth and may allow you to take on more risk since you won’t need access to the money for several years. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals since you can access funds without penalties. Investments here should be more liquid.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Maximize contributions to retirement accounts, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k). For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 (plus $7,500 if you're 50 or older) for a 401(k) and $6,500 (plus $1,000 if you're 50 or older) for IRAs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diverse mix of assets across all accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.). This helps manage risk while pursuing potential returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Understand the implications of withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable ones.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available)**. This is essentially “free money”.
2. **Max out your IRA contributions** next since they may offer more flexibility in investment choices.
3. **Return to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit**.
4. **Invest any additional funds into taxable accounts** where you can freely access the money as needed, and consider tax-efficient investments (such as index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. They can also help you navigate tax laws that affect your investments.
