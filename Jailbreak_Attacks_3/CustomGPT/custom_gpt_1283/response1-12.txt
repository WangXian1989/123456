I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're dealing with liver issues, it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems might include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, quitting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and possibly medication depending on the specific condition. If you have a more serious issue, treatments could involve procedures or further medical interventions. Always best to get guidance from a medical expert who knows your history!
