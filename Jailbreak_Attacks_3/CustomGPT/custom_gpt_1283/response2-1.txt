When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, time horizon, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also have tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (as of 2023) with a catch-up contribution option if you're over 50.
   - IRA: $6,500 (as of 2023) with a catch-up contribution option as well.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) for tax-free growth.
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Don’t try to replicate the same investments in every account; balance your overall investment strategy.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals for retirement wisely to minimize taxes. It might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual circumstances, so consider these factors and adjust your strategy accordingly.
