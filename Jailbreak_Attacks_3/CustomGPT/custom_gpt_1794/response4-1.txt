The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the current year. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate which type aligns with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer the same tax benefits but provide flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Diversification and Liquidity Needs**: Keep some liquidity in your taxable accounts for short-term needs or unexpected expenses. The rest can be allocated to retirement accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term growth (e.g., retirement savings), prioritize accounts with the highest tax advantages.
   - For medium to short-term goals, consider having more assets in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your asset allocation matches your comfort with risk while still adhering to the investment growth needed for your various goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
