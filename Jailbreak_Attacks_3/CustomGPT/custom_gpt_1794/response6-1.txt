To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim for at least the minimum required to get the full match.
   - This boosts your retirement savings without excess tax implications.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your income level).
   - Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income.
   - Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts**: Once you've utilized the benefits of your 401(k) and IRA, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - Consider lower-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Explore tax-efficient investment strategies, such as ETFs.

4. **Balance Between Growth and Safety**: Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts suitable to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - Youthful investors may lean towards equities.
   - Older investors might prefer bonds or stable investments.

Regularly re-evaluate your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal financial goals to optimize your distribution approach.
