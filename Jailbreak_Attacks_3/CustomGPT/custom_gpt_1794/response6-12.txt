I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems that you might consider discussing with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Incorporating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing alcohol intake and processed foods can support liver health.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Engaging in regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed to manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids:** These can be used for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Surgical Options:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases where the liver is failing, a transplant may be necessary.

4. **Alternative Therapies:**
   - **Herbal Supplements:** Some people explore herbal remedies, although their efficacy and safety should be discussed with a physician.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
