The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth), which can be beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments with high growth potential or frequent trading here.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Assess Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices in your 401(k) and IRA compared to your taxable account. If the 401(k) has limited choices or high fees, you might prefer to invest more in your IRA or taxable accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize growth and can afford to take more risks with their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may focus on preserving capital, which might mean more money in safer assets or taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your total investment portfolio is well-diversified. This means considering how your money is distributed across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distributions with your long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate and your financial situation changes, regularly rebalance your allocations to ensure they remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to craft a personalized strategy based on your individual financial situation.
