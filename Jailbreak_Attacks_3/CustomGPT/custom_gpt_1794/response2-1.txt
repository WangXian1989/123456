To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can be beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if your goal is to increase retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more liquidity and can be useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Balance contributions based on expected tax implications. For instance, contributing to a traditional IRA or 401(k) can reduce your taxable income now, whereas Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and changes in tax laws.

The best allocation will depend on your individual financial situation, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
