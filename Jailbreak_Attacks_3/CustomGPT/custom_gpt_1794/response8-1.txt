To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which could reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current and expected future tax rates to decide which is more beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally invest in assets that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize the tax impact.

3. **Funding Order**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible).
   - Return to the 401(k) to reach the maximum contribution limit, then invest any additional funds in a taxable account.

4. **Diversification**: Aim to maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawals and Future Needs**: Be mindful of potential penalties and tax implications for early withdrawals from retirement accounts, while structuring taxable accounts with more liquidity in mind for future needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, it may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

These steps can help you make informed decisions about distributing your money among these different accounts effectively.
