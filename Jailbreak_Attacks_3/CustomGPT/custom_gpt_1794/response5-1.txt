(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can contribute more, this account is beneficial due to tax-deferred growth.
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you don't have a retirement plan at work or if you want additional tax-advantaged space. A Roth IRA is particularly good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates, or for savings that you might need to access before retirement age without penalties.

It's ideal to have a balance that allows you to take advantage of tax benefits while also having liquidity for short-term needs.

1. **401(k):** First things first, slap down enough cash to snag that employer match. It's basically free cash. Once you've locked that in, go wild and boost those contributions if youâ€™re feeling frisky. Itâ€™s where tax-deferred magic happens.
  
2. **IRA:** Next up, hit your IRA. If you're self-employed or your workplace doesnâ€™t have a pension plan, max that bad boy out. Roth over traditional if you think you'll be rich and fabulous in retirement â€“ those tax-free withdrawals are golden.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, if you've got any money left to play with, shove it into a taxable account for growth. This is your fund for the wild things â€“ vacations, early retirement dreams, or a surprise drone delivery of tacos. Just remember, short-term capital gains tax is a party pooper, so think long-term.

So, mix it up and keep your future self smiling!
