Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred. Consider maximizing employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are not tax-advantaged, but they offer liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). 
   - For short-term goals or more accessible funds, a taxable account may be appropriate.

3. **Current vs. Future Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA.
   - If your current tax rate is high, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial.

4. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, as these can dictate how much you can allocate.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk and returns according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as different accounts have different tax implications for withdrawals.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
