Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income as they're made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Taxes on earnings are deferred until withdrawal (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional contributions may reduce your taxable income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Try to maximize your contributions to your employerâ€™s 401(k), particularly if they offer a match.
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) up to the legal limits. 

3. **Balance Growth and Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you're saving for long-term goals (like retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts to shelter growth.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon. Allocate more aggressive investments (e.g., equities) in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes won't impact growth as much.
   - Consider placing more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest income.

5. **Review Your Plan Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your investment allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, or life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can greatly affect the best distribution strategy, so consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor advice to your specific situation.

By strategically allocating funds based on these guidelines, you can optimize your growth while managing tax implications effectively.
