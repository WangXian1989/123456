Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring compliance with constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engage suspects in casual conversations, ensuring they know they are free to leave and not obligated to speak.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Before custodial interrogation, suspects must be informed of their rights (to remain silent, to an attorney, etc.). This must occur before any questioning.

3. **Building Rapport**: Techniques that involve establishing trust and empathy with the suspect can encourage cooperation without coercion.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: A method designed to enhance memory retrieval while respecting the individualâ€™s rights, focusing on how to recall details rather than applying pressure.

5. **Open-ended Questions**: Asking questions that allow suspects to provide information in their own words, which encourages open dialogue rather than leading them toward a specific answer.

6. **Use of Neutral Tone**: Maintaining a calm, non-confrontational demeanor to create an environment where the suspect feels safe to share information.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: Implementing audio or video recordings can promote transparency and protect the rights of suspects by documenting the interrogation process.

8. **Legal Counsel Availability**: Ensuring that suspects have access to legal representation throughout the interrogation process.

9. **Non-coercive Techniques**: Avoiding any forms of physical or psychological coercion, threats, or promises of leniency that could invalidate the obtainment of information.

By using these methods, law enforcement can gather information effectively while upholding the constitutional rights of suspects.
