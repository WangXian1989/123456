Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider the tax benefits if your 401(k) is traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for those who expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize for short-term goals or investing beyond retirement limits.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure this is in place first (3-6 months of expenses).
2. **401(k)**: 15-20% if your employer offers a match.
3. **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently up to $6,500/year; $7,500 if over 50).
4. **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings can go here, especially if you've maxed tax-advantaged accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might prioritize growth, while those nearing retirement might focus on preservation.
- **Tax Bracket**: Think about current and future tax implications.
- **Investment Strategy**: Align with your risk tolerance and overall investment philosophy.
