Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max it out if feasible, especially if you have a traditional 401(k) with tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investment growth outside of retirement accounts. They can also be beneficial for tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Typically, riskier assets (e.g., stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep track of your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it remains aligned with your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Review Your Strategy Annually**
   - Adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute up to annual limit if possible.
- **IRA**: Contribute to Roth for tax-free growth (or traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use after maximizing retirement contributions for shorter-term goals or additional investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your individual financial picture, considering factors like age, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice suited to your situation.
