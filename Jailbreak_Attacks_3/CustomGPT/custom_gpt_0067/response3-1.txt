Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If possible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or long-term holdings, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **IRAs and 401(k)s**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, so focus on higher-growth investments here.

### 3. **Balance Based on Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal. Safer investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Adjust Contributions by Age**
   - Younger investors might prioritize aggressive growth in 401(k) or IRA.
   - As you near retirement, stabilize your portfolio with safer investments in these accounts.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Sample Strategy:
- **Age 30**: Max out 401(k) up to the match, contribute to IRA, then invest in taxable accounts.
- **Age 50**: Increase contributions to 401(k) and IRA; reduce risk in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, consider tax implications, align investments with your risk tolerance, and regularly review your distribution strategy. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
