To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferrals.
- **Understand Withdrawal Rules:** Use traditional accounts for long-term growth; Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Investment Goals and Timeline
- **Align with Goals:** If saving for retirement, emphasize 401(k) and IRA contributions.
- **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some cash or investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

### 3. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your portfolio as market conditions change and as you approach retirement.

### 4. Fees and Expenses
- **Monitor Fees:** Choose low-cost investment options in all accounts, especially in your 401(k) where fees can vary.
- **Use Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider municipal bonds or index funds in taxable accounts to reduce tax liabilities.

### Summary
Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, align your strategy with your financial goals, maintain diversification, and keep an eye on fees.
