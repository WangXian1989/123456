Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize your employer match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum if you can, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. 
   - The limit for contributions can vary, so check the current guidelines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for extra savings and investments once you've maxed out your retirement accounts.
   - Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains; consider low-turnover index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. More aggressive growth can be suited for retirement accounts, while more conservative investments might be better in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
