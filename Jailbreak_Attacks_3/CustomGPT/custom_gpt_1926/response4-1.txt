To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to your IRA next, focusing on either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. The tax advantages can be significant.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize long-term growth.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, tax laws, or life circumstances.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
