When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Focus on a diverse mix of investments available within the plan, keeping long-term goals in mind.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for current tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to your IRA if you're eligible, especially if you can qualify for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Build an emergency fund here as you can withdraw without penalties (unlike retirement accounts).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough for the employer match, then focus on maxing out your IRA contributions.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investments in a taxable account, while ensuring your emergency fund is fully funded.

### General Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio regularly and rebalance based on your goals and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.

It's important to consider your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals when making these decisions.
