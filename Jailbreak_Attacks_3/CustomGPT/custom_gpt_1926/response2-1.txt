Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Max Out Employer-Sponsored Plans:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The 2023 contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA as well. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Focus initial contributions here to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Tax-Free Growth (Roth IRA):** Prioritize this for long-term goals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Adjust your asset allocation based on how long you plan to keep your money invested and your comfort with risk.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Reassess your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and changing circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial professional.

### Summary:
- **Max out 401(k) to get the employer match.**
- **Invest in an IRA for additional tax advantages.**
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term needs.**

This strategy can help you build a diverse and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
