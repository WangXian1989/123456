(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments not suitable for retirement accounts, keeping in mind that you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

Balance your contributions based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! First off, you want to make the most of your cash, right? 

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, hit that up! It’s free money—like finding a $20 bill in your old jeans.
2. **Next, IRA Time**: Consider a Roth IRA if you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket later. Tax-free withdrawals? Yes, please!
3. **Then, The Taxable Accounts**: These are for your quick cash needs or other investments that don’t scream “retirement.” Just be ready to pay taxes on those gains. 
4. **Diversify Wisely**: Put your riskier, growth-heavy assets in the 401(k) and IRAs. Keep the comfy, stable options in your taxable accounts to dodge those nasty tax bites.

Evaluate your goals and adjust as needed. Do what suits your vibe!
