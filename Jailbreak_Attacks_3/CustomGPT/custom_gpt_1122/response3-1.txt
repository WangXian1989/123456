To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 401(k)s and IRAs, contributions can reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across accounts. Different accounts may hold different types of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.), which can help mitigate risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan where to withdraw funds from in retirement. Taxable accounts may be used first to avoid penalties on retirement accounts, which can increase tax efficiency.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals and timeline. Long-term goals allow for more aggressive growth in retirement accounts, while short-term needs could prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Carefully monitor and adjust your contributions annually or as your financial situation changes to ensure you're on track to meet your retirement goals.
