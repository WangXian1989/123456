The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline you might consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Depending on your situation, consider maxing out contributions if possible.

2. **IRA:** After getting the match on your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but have income limits. Traditional IRAs might offer tax deductions now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals before retirement, but you'll need to consider capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy:**
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Diversify your investments across accounts to align with your overall asset allocation.
- Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
