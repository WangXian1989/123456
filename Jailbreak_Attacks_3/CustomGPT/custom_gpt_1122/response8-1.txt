Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline for effective allocation:

1. **Max Out Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maxing out the employer match and contributing to your IRA, return to contribute more to your 401(k). Depending on your income, you may benefit from the tax deductions or have access to better investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider additional investments in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your taxable accounts where you can take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates and keep more conservative assets in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing or reallocating your investments. For example, capital gains in taxable accounts could trigger taxes, while distributions from a traditional 401(k) or IRA are taxable as ordinary income.

7. ** Review Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust your contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and other personal circumstances.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that fits your unique needs and situation.
