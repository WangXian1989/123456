To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older).

2. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) if contributions are deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, so be mindful of the timing of your investment sales.

4. **Investment Growth**: Allocate higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to defer taxes, while more stable investments (like bonds or cash) might be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid assets before heavily investing in retirement accounts, as you may not easily access funds in these accounts without penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio allocations based on performance, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.

By balancing these factors, you'll create a distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals and tax situation.
