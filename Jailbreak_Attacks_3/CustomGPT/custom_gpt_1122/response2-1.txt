Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're receiving a match. Traditional 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on your contributions or any investment gains until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can lower your taxable income for the year you contribute.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer greater flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

5. **Review Your Asset Location:** Consider where to place your investments. For example, place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free growth, and keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for potentially lower tax implications.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:** Review your financial goals regularly (annually or semi-annually) and adjust your contributions as needed based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced distribution of your investments that align with your long-term financial goals.
