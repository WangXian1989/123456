To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has specific contribution limits and tax implications. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50). 

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially “free money” and should be a priority.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, prioritize contributing to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) because they provide significant tax advantages.

4. **Tax Diversification**: Depending on your tax situation, allocate funds to taxable accounts to benefit from capital gains, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Investment Growth**: Consider your investment options within each account. 401(k) plans often have limited selections compared to IRAs and taxable accounts, where you can choose from a wider array of investments.

6. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, longer time horizons allow for riskier investments, which can be beneficial in tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs and circumstances.
