It's great that you're thinking about distributing your money wisely! Here are some strategies to consider for allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may reduce your taxable income, but taxes will apply upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Some investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts. For example, higher-growth investments may be better in an IRA or 401(k) to defer taxes, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: 
   - Ensure youâ€™re not overly concentrated in one type of asset or account. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes can help manage risk.

5. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.
