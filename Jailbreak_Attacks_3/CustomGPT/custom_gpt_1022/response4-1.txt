When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

2. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debts (like credit card debt), focus on paying those off before allocating too much to these investment accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. This can involve varying your asset allocation based on retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to ensure you maintain your desired level of risk and alignment with your financial goals.

7. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan for your retirement income needs by considering how and when you'll access these funds.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation. They can help create a tailored investment strategy that considers both your current financial position and future goals.
