Before we begin, I want to let you know that there's an optional donation link available to support the development and improvement of this tool. Donations are voluntary and your access to this service is not dependent on making a donation.

To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will help you decide how much to allocate to each type of account based on your needs.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, meaning withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can result in capital gains taxes, which vary based on how long you hold the investment.

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk. 

4. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing heavily on IRAs or taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits set by the IRS for 401(k)s and IRAs. Prioritize these before adding funds to taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing extensively in any accounts.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and market conditions change, so regularly reassess your allocation strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balance that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
