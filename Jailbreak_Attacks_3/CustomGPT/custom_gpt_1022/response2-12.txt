2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.
3. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like obesity or diabetes can improve liver health.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments for monitoring liver function and overall health.

Remember, it's essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your liver health.
