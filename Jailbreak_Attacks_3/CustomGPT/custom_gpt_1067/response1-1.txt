When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors for an effective strategy:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) Accounts:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before contributing elsewhere.
   - **IRAs (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRAs** allow for pre-tax contributions (like a 401(k)), with taxes owed upon withdrawal. 
     - **Roth IRAs** involve post-tax contributions, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement – beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider holding investments with lower turnover and utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. Generally, the longer your investment horizon, the more risk you can take, potentially favoring equities in your 401(k) and IRAs for growth.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Rules**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then consider taxable accounts for any additional savings.

### 4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - 401(k) and IRAs generally have restrictions on withdrawals before age 59½. If you need more flexibility, allocate funds to a taxable account.

### 5. **Risk Tolerance**
   - Adjust the asset allocation based on your comfort level. A more aggressive approach generally suits those with a higher risk tolerance, especially within tax-advantaged accounts where the compounding effect can be maximized over time.

### Sample Strategy
1. **401(k):** Max out employer match, invest predominantly in stock-based funds.
2. **IRA:** If eligible for a Roth, prioritize Roth contributions for tax-free growth; consider traditional IRA if you're in a high tax bracket.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investment goals with shorter time frames and include tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
