Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Favor savings in taxable accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):**
     - **Traditional:** Contributions reduce taxable income now; taxes are due on withdrawal.
     - **Roth:** Contributions are from after-tax income; withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Similar benefits as a 401(k). Analyze income limits and tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for investments that may generate tax-efficient income (e.g., qualified dividends).
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts can be more favorable, depending on your tax bracket.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified and align with your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan which accounts you'll draw from first in retirement, considering tax implications.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your strategy based on changes in tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy: 
- **40% 401(k)** (with employer match maxed out)
- **30% IRA** (if eligible for Roth, consider that option)
- **30% Taxable Accounts**

### Additional Considerations:
- **Fees:** Be aware of investment fees in 401(k) plans.
- **Investment Choices:** Review the available options in each account type for their growth potential.

### Consulting a Financial Advisor:
For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor, especially regarding tax strategies and market conditions.

By following this structured approach, you can make informed decisions on distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
