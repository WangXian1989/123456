It's essential to consider several factors when deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **401(k) Considerations**: 
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if your employer offers matching funds. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Evaluate your investment options within the plan. Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds.

2. **IRA Considerations**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you on withdrawals later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: This account offers flexibility in withdrawals without penalties but lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Distribution Strategy:

1. **Prioritize Employer Matches**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
2. **Max Out IRAs**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings in a taxable account.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prefer more stocks, while those closer to retirement might prioritize bonds or stable investments.
