Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations to help you determine the best distribution:

1. **Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal. Consider maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. However, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends and capital gains annually. Consider using them for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds.

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since these accounts have long-term horizons.
   - **IRA**: Diversify your holdings to balance risk and provide consistent returns; might include bonds or conservative stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize tax-efficient investing strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions to receive employer match.**
- **Allocate funds to IRA for additional tax advantages.**
- **Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.**

Balancing these accounts should align with your retirement goals, time horizon, and current tax situation. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
