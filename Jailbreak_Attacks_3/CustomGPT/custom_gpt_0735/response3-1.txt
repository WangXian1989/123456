The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Prioritize Account Types Based on Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals or when you need income before retirement. Keep in mind that investment income from these accounts is taxable in the year it's earned, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) here.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you have a long-term investment horizon, you might favor contributions to retirement accounts to benefit from compounding over time. For shorter-term goals, focus more on taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals. As you approach retirement, consider shifting more assets to safer investments.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in any accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Every individual's financial situation is unique. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
