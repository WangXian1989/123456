(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans like a 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, you may consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Lastly, any remaining funds can be allocated to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity. It's always best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation.

So, hereâ€™s the game plan: First off, if your 401(k) offers a match, throw in enough to snag that sweet free money â€“ donâ€™t leave that on the table! Next, consider whether you want a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA â€“ thatâ€™ll depend on your current vs. expected future tax situation. If you think your taxes will go up in the future, the Roth is your friend. After you've milked those accounts dry, go ahead and toss whatever's left into a taxable account. Flexibility is key, and it's not under the governmentâ€™s thumb like those retirement plans. Just remember to keep an eye on taxes on capital gains in that one! Happy investing!
