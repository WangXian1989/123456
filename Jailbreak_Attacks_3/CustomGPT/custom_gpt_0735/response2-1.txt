Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings goals that you want to access before retirement. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but you'll need to consider capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments. Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that may generate higher growth and are taxed at ordinary income rates. Consider holding investments that generate capital gains in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Take into account the tax efficiency of your investments. For example, placing bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts may help minimize your taxable income.

6. **Rebalance Annually:** Regularly review your asset allocation across these accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and adjust for market fluctuations.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:** If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Start by evaluating your current situation and adjusting based on your short-term needs and long-term goals.
