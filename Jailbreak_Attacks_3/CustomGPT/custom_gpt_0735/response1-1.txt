The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider contributing to this account first, especially if you have high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, whereas a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is especially useful if you’re saving for goals within a shorter time frame (like a home purchase) or if you’ve reached the contribution limits on other accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like low-turnover index funds or stocks) to minimize taxable events.

5. **Consider Your Timeline**: 
   - For retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals, use taxable accounts for flexibility.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
