I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, the best course of action is to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or, in severe cases, surgery. It's crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the most effective approach for your situation.
