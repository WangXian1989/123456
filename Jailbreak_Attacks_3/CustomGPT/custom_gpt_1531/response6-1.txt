To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these retirement accounts often provide tax benefits either by deferring taxes (traditional) or allowing for tax-free growth (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed annually, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's plan especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution. The 2023 limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older) in an IRA. Consider a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free compounding.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those that generate frequent income (like bonds), as they will be taxed more favorably in this environment.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure a portion remains liquid for emergencies or short-term needs, potentially in a high-yield savings account or accessible investments within your taxable account.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about your specific situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial goals and tax situation.

By cleverly balancing these accounts, you can maximize growth, manage tax liabilities effectively, and have the flexibility for your financial needs.
