To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay income tax until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains in these accounts are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals (like buying a house), a taxable account may be more accessible.

4. **Investment Choices**: 
   - Keep high-growth or high-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable income-generating investments, which could benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Portfolio Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, your retirement timeline, and any changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations vary widely, so consider seeking personalized advice to determine the best strategy for your specific circumstances.

These suggestions will help you create an effective distribution strategy for your investments across these different types of accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
