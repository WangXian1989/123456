Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can, as 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Determine whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial for you based on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - Yearly contribution limits apply, so prioritize annual contributions to these accounts once you’ve taken full advantage of your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate significant capital gains or interest income, as these can be taxed at a higher rate.
   - Consider holding more conservative investments in taxable accounts since they might generate less taxable income.

4. **General Distribution Strategy**:
   - Start by ensuring you’re maximizing any employer matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - Next, aim to max out your IRA contributions.
   - Finally, allocate any additional funds into your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing & Adjusting**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocation across these accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
   - Keep an eye on tax implications for withdrawals and investment gains, particularly for taxable accounts.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation to optimize your strategy.
