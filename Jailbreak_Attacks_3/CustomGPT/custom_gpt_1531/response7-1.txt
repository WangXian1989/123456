To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the employer match, prioritize contributions to an IRA (Roth or traditional, depending on your tax situation), as this can offer tax benefits either now or in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and still have funds to invest, allocate money to taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you wish to access funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your investment goals and risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where gains arenâ€™t taxed until withdrawal. In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments such as index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations regularly and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your individual financial situation, consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized strategies tailored to your long-term goals and tax situation.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investments across different types of accounts based on tax implications and your financial goals.
