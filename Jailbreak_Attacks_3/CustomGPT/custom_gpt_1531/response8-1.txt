Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth). These accounts offer tax benefits that can help grow your savings more efficiently.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial, as you can defer taxes until withdrawal. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA might be preferable since you pay taxes now, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: A mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can provide flexibility in retirement. Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalty, while tax-advantaged accounts offer growth without immediate tax impact.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investment types based on the account. For example, it may be wise to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free, while holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Adjust contributions to maintain your desired balance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re uncertain about the best allocation for your situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

It's essential to make informed decisions based on your specific situation and goals.
