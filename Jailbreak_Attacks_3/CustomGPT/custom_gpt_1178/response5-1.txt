Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in a taxable account for flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement or if you have already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance. More aggressive investments (like stocks) can go in tax-advantaged accounts due to potential growth and tax implications.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
