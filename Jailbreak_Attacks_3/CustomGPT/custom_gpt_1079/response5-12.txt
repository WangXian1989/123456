I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver health and treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for any liver-related concerns, as they can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. 

Some common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Dietary modifications, such as reducing alcohol consumption and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Regular exercise to help maintain a healthy weight and improve overall health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, a doctor might prescribe medications to manage symptoms, prevent complications, or treat underlying issues like hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**:
   - Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and progression of liver disease.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures may be necessary, such as liver transplantation for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may consider supplements or herbal remedies; however, these should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as they can sometimes do more harm than good.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan for liver issues. They are best equipped to guide you based on your health status.
