To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored, with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes but offer more liquidity and flexible withdrawal options.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match; this is essentially free money.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, especially if you've already met contribution limits for retirement accounts.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to guide your allocation across these accounts. Common strategies include:
  - **Stocks for Growth**: Favor stocks in taxable accounts for long-term gain and lower capital gains taxes.
  - **Bonds for Stability**: Place bonds in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to shield interest income from taxes.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and shifting financial goals.

### Summary
- Begin with maximizing employer 401(k) contributions.
- Follow with IRA contributions to optimize tax savings.
- Finally, invest surplus funds in taxable accounts while considering your overall tax strategy and liquidity needs.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your investments and work towards your financial goals.
