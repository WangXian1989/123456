To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored, offering pre-tax or Roth contributions, ideal for long-term savings with potential employer matches.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, subject to certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for investments without tax advantages. They are more flexible and can be accessed anytime, but capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth), based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, dividends, and interest, which are taxed differently than traditional retirement accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be appropriate for long-term growth, while bonds could be better for lower risk.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your portfolio across asset classes to manage risk. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - **Age Factors**: Younger investors might prioritize growth in their 401(k) and IRAs, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on preserving capital in taxable accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan out when you will withdraw funds and from which accounts, as different accounts have varied tax implications for withdrawals.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance. Rebalance as necessary to ensure that your investment strategy remains aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion
The optimal strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
