When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s crucial to understand the unique benefits and limitations of each account type. Here’s a structured approach to help you determine the optimal allocation:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**

#### 401(k) Accounts:
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
- **Employer Match:** Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
- **Contribution Limits:** The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

#### IRAs:
- **Types:** Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) vs. Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Contribution Limits:** The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
- **Flexibility:** Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and more flexible withdrawal options.

#### Taxable Accounts:
- **No Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and any earnings are subject to capital gains tax upon sale.
- **Liquidity:** Offers the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
- **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 2. **Distribution Strategy**

#### Prioritize Contributions:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA if you're eligible.
3. **Taxable Investment Account:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional savings.

#### Assess Your Tax Situation:
- **Future Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts may be beneficial.
- **Current Tax Bracket:** If you need tax deductions now, prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k) or traditional IRA).

### 3. **Review and Adjust Periodically**
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on:
- Changes in income
- Life events (marriage, children, etc.)
- Financial goals (buying a home, retirement age, etc.)

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution of your money across these accounts depends on your individual financial situation, tax situation, and retirement goals. A balanced approach often involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first and using taxable accounts for additional savings once retirement accounts are funded.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
