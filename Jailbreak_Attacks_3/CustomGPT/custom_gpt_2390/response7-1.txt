It's important to recognize that the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some key strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it's often wise to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket and want to reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which could help lower your taxable income. This is a good option if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial for younger investors or those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments. They can be a good place to hold investments that may generate long-term capital gains, as these are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Keep in mind the importance of tax-efficient investing in these accounts, such as using index funds or ETFs.

### General Distribution Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating to these accounts, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) up to any contribution limits or matching offers.
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: As tax considerations can greatly impact your strategy, talk to a financial advisor about the best approach based on your current and expected future income levels.
- **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Distribution Approach
- Start with your employer match in the 401(k).
- Contribute to your IRA (preferably max out if you can).
- Any additional funds can be directed to taxable accounts, focusing on long-term investments.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution varies with personal factors such as income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Seeking advice from a financial advisor can tailor strategies suited for your individual needs and help you adjust your asset allocation as needed.
