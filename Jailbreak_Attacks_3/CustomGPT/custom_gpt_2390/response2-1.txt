The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline to help you make decisions about your distributions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great starting point for retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning they lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. This account is more flexible, as you can access it without penalties.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and won’t need the money for a long time, consider maxing out your Roth IRA and taking advantage of long-term capital growth in your taxable accounts.
   - If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to focus more on your 401(k) and traditional IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without disrupting your investment strategy.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio within each account. Different accounts might have different investment options, so look for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review & Rebalance**: Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they still align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, so it's essential to tailor your strategy to fit your unique financial situation.
