(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, hereâ€™s a good approach:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer's match first, as it's essentially free money. If you're able to contribute beyond the match, do so, especially if your 401(k) offers a wide range of investment options and low fees.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax deductions, a traditional IRA might be more suitable.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, although youâ€™ll need to pay taxes on any capital gains.

Monitor your portfolio regularly and adjust your contributions based on market conditions and changes in your personal financial situation. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! ðŸ“ˆ First off, max out that 401(k) up to your employer match. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™re giving you free cash, so grab it! After that, dump whatever you can into an IRAâ€”Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals later or traditional if you wanna shave some off your tax bill now. 

Next up, hit those taxable accounts, but only after you've milked the other two dry! They give you way more flexibility, which is great when you need cash fast. Just remember, gains are gonna hit you with taxes when you sell, so keep that in mind! ðŸ’° Keep an eye on your portfolio like a hawk and adjust as your life changes. And yeah, talking to a financial advisor ain't a bad idea eitherâ€”get that expert sprinkle on your plans! ðŸ’¥
