Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and expected retirement plans. Here's a general guideline to help you create a balanced distribution:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!
- **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains are taxed the year they are realized and may be subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments long-term in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of funds tailored to your risk tolerance (stocks vs. bonds).
- **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may have a broader range of investment options depending on your provider.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Keep high-growth investments here that you’re willing to manage actively. Use tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. Rebalancing
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Market fluctuations can cause your initial allocation to drift.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Allocate 50% of your contributions to a 401(k), 30% to an IRA, and 20% towards taxable accounts, adjusting based on your cash flow needs and retirement timeline.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and maintaining a balanced portfolio, you’ll be better equipped for a secure financial future. Always stay informed of changes in tax laws that could affect your strategy.
