It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options typically depend on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.

General treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and weight management can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications such as antiviral drugs (for hepatitis), corticosteroids (for autoimmune liver diseases), or drugs to reduce liver inflammation may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation may be required.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to explore which treatment options are appropriate for your specific situation. Have you had any recent tests or consultations that provide more context for your liver issues?
