Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general framework:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (with an extra $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50). Focus on maximizing this account if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (which may provide tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The maximum contribution for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). This can also offer additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible and provide liquidity for shorter-term goals. They don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but can hold investments that may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings (3-6 months of expenses) before aggressively investing.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments with high tax implications (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and investments with lower tax implications (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Annual or semi-annual reviews of your asset allocation and contributions to ensure alignment with changing goals.

It's crucial to tailor this general approach to your specific financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance. 

### Question:
What are your primary financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.), and how quickly do you need access to your investments?
