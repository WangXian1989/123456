Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key factors to think about:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Employer matching contributions can also enhance growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs typically offer tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages for contributions, but you can withdraw funds at any time without penalty, and only pay capital gains tax on the profits when you sell.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Ensure you're maximizing any employer match in your 401(k) first.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Assess the investment options in each account. Some 401(k) plans may have limited or higher-fee investment choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Money in taxable accounts is more accessible without penalties compared to retirement accounts, which have restrictions on withdrawals until age 59Â½.

5. **Future Tax Implications**:
   - Consider your expected tax bracket during retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, prioritizing tax-deferred contributions (like to a 401(k)) may be advantageous.

6. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Consider Roth Options**: If available, consider a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth based on your situation).
4. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to your taxable investments for liquidity and flexibility.

#### Next Steps:
- Analyze your current financial situation and retirement goals.
- How are you currently allocating funds, and what changes do you think might enhance your financial strategy?
