(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, here are some principles to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here at least to the maximum match limit to take full advantage of that ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù The contributions reduce your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A traditional IRA can provide tax advantages similar to a 401(k), while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate more immediate income or for funds you might need in the short term. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains and dividends.

It's generally beneficial to focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (like the 401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts. Personal circumstances can vary widely, so it might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy.
