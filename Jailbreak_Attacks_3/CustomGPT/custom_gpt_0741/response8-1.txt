To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Try to maximize your contributions if possible, as contributions are often pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k) contributions, consider making contributions to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts should generally be invested in lower turnover and/or tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs. These produce fewer taxable events than actively managed funds.
   - Avoid holding high-yield investments (like bonds or REITs) in a taxable account, as they are subject to ordinary income tax.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Assess your investment goals (retirement, education, large purchases) and time horizon for each account. Longer-term goals can often take more risk.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are properly diversified, considering both asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment types to balance risk and return.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Check your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level. As markets fluctuate, different accounts might drift from your target percentages.

6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - If your financial situation is complex, consider working with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.

Would it help to explore specific allocation percentages based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals?
