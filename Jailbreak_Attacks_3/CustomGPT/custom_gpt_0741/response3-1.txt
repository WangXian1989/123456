Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Usually offered through an employer, often has matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible, with no contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions. Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Keep higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or dividend-paying stocks, as they are taxed favorably at capital gains rates in the long term.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Maintain an emergency savings fund outside of retirement accounts to cover at least 3-6 months of expenses.
   - Only invest in taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged options, if you have sufficient liquidity.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all your accounts, considering asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

### 6. **Revisit Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations periodically and adjust them based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation: 
- **401(k):** Max employer match + additional contributions (e.g., 15% of salary).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 annual limit, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any remaining disposable income.

### Conclusion
What's your current financial situation like, and what specific goals do you have for retirement? This will help to tailor a more specific allocation strategy for your needs.
