To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After getting the employer match, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and liquidity but come with potential capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) or hold onto investments longer to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts. Consider more aggressive investments in these accounts since you wonâ€™t be taxed until withdrawal (for traditional accounts) or not at all (for Roth accounts).
   - In taxable accounts, you might want to focus on income-generating investments that benefit from favorable tax treatment, such as qualified dividends.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced allocation across asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your goals.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and time horizon should dictate how you allocate funds. Younger investors may lean more towards stocks, while older investors might focus on bonds.

How do you currently allocate your investments, and what are your primary financial goals for the next 5 to 10 years?
