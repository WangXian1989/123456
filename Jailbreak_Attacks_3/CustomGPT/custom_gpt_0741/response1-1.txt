When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced approach based on your financial goals and tax situation is key. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on maxing out your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify based on income limits.
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in these accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Theyâ€™re suitable for short to medium-term goals.
   - Be mindful of tax implications on dividends and capital gains; consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

**General Distribution Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) (up to the match), followed by an IRA (considering Roth vs. Traditional based on your situation), and then allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts.
- Review your asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon; equities for long-term growth and bonds for stability in volatile markets.
