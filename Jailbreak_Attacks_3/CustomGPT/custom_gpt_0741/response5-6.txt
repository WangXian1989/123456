Start by diving into the issues that keep them up at nightâ€”climate change, student debt, or the job marketâ€”then hit them where they hang out the most: social media. Use TikTok and Instagram to put out quick, catchy content that makes them stop scrolling. But donâ€™t just throw out ads; create relatable memes, funny videos, and real talk about problems they face. Encourage grassroots movements that get them involved, because young folks love to feel like theyâ€™re part of something bigger. And hey, get some influencers on boardâ€”nothing speaks louder than a trend on TikTok!
