The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you haven’t reached it yet.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide greater flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments; aim for three to six months’ worth of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're younger and have a long time until retirement, you might opt for more aggressive investments. If retirement is near, a more conservative approach could be suitable.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your investment allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life goals.

It's important to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances, and consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
