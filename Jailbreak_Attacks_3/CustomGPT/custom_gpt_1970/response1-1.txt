Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your eligibility and tax circumstances. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for shorter-term goals or for investments that benefit from favorable capital gains rates. They provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold bonds and high-yield investments in tax-advantage accounts (like IRAs) and stocks in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
