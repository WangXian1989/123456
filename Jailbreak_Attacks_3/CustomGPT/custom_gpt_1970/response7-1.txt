I'm glad you're thinking about your investment strategy! Here are some general guidelines for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match—it’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Aim to maximize contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income (e.g., dividends or interest) since you have more flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they often generate interest.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

Adjust these strategies based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice!
