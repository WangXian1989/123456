Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Tax Advantage**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA may be better if you want tax deductions now.
   - **Max Contribution**: Contribute up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or if you need accessible funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes. Consider index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Medium/Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, with any additional funds going into taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
Regularly assess your allocation based on performance and life changes. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
