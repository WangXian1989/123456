To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred. Good for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Choose based on future tax brackets (traditional for now, Roth for tax-free growth later).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering the tax implications of each account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust allocations to remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
