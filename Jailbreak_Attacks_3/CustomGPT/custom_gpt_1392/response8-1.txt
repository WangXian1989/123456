To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money needed in the near term.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Capital gains tax in taxable accounts can impact your returns. Consider holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.
   - Be mindful of withdrawal rules and penalties associated with retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on market conditions and changing financial goals.

Itâ€™s often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.
