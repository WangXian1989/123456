The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a diversified mix of funds (e.g., stocks, bonds) based on your age and risk tolerance.
   - **Tax Implications**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider a Roth 401(k) if available for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to fully fund your IRA each year ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older as of 2023).
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on current vs. anticipated future tax rates. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Similar to your 401(k), use a diversified investment approach.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, or if you might need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.
   - **Dividend Stocks**: Be cautious with high-dividend stocks, as they can be taxed at ordinary income rates.

### **General Strategy**
- **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a balanced portfolio of equities, fixed income, and other assets based on your risk profile.
- **Consider Taxation**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth-focused investments, and use taxable accounts for more conservative income-generating assets.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

### **Conclusion**
Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation, as they can help optimize tax strategies and account distributions to maximize your long-term wealth.
