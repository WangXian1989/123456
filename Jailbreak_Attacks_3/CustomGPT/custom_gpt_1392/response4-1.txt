Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can either defer taxes or withdraw tax-free in retirement. 

3. **Assess Your Tax Situations**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments expected to grow significantly since you can defer or avoid taxes on growth.
   - Taxable accounts are better for investments you may need to access before retirement, as they provide more flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and potential returns.

5. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep a portion of your money in your taxable account for short-term needs and emergencies, as 401(k) and IRA funds typically come with penalties and restrictions on early withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help create a tailored plan based on your unique circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution is one that aligns with your financial goals, expected future income, and tax strategy.
