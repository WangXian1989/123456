   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Insulin Sensitizers**: For fatty liver disease related to insulin resistance.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Such as milk thistle or SAMe, though these should be used with caution and under medical advice.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests.
   - Imaging studies like ultrasound or MRI as needed.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In cases of severe liver damage or cancer, a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may find benefit from acupuncture or herbal treatments, always under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
