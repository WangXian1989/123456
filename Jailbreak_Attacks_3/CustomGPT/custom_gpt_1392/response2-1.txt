Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account or easily accessible cash.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Contribution**: If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k). This amount is tax-deferred, which can help reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions if your budget allows, as this can help grow your retirement savings significantly, especially in a tax-advantaged account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement (e.g., buying a house or funding education). 
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on your overall risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes across all accounts to ensure diversification.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and your life situation.

### Example Allocation:

- **401(k)**: 40% of retirement contributions (including the match)
- **IRA**: 30% of retirement contributions
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30% for any mid-term goals or as a general investment strategy
