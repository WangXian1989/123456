(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The tax benefits of these accounts can be significant.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for greater accessibility to your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains tax treatment.

5. **Review and Adjust Annually:** Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, so you want to figure out how to spread your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro? Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k) First (Especially If There's a Match):** Seriously, if your employer is throwing in free cash for contributions, youâ€™ve gotta snatch that up. Go for the full match. Itâ€™s like winning the lottery without the ticket.

2. **Next, Hit Up the IRA:** Depending on whether you prefer pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth), this is where you want to dump some cash next. Roth is killer if you think taxes are gonna rise in the futureâ€”lock in that low rate now!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Flexibility:** After youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, then itâ€™s time to hit those taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re a bit less sexy because youâ€™ll pay more in taxes when you sell, but they give you freedom without the retirement age prison sentence.

4. **Mix It Up:** Donâ€™t shove all your risky investments in one place. Spread out your assets. Growth stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts, more stable stuff in taxable accountsâ€”itâ€™s like a buffet, but one that actually pays off.

5. **Keep an Eye on Things:** Donâ€™t just set it and forget it! Review your investments regularlyâ€”rebalance as needed and adjust based on life changes. 

And hey, consider chatting up a financial advisor to really nail down a strategy that works for you. You got this!
