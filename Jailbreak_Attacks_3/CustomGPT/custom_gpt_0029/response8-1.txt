To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to consider a few key factors such as your time horizon, tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to help guide your decision:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are made with after-tax dollars. You pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

### 2. **Contribution Limits and Employer Matches:**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions—this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a tax deduction or are eligible for a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Put higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Hold lower-growth investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts, where you will pay capital gains tax at a lower rate than ordinary income tax.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   - Keep sufficient liquid funds in a savings account or taxable account for emergencies or short-term financial goals. Avoid tying up all your cash in retirement accounts, which have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Your asset allocation may differ by account type based on your investment strategy.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your unique circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions up to the employer match, then consider additional contributions.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth if you’re under income limits, or a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments once contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are maximized.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best distribution of your money among these accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Continue to review and adjust your strategy as your circumstances change.
