I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver problems and potential treatment options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can support liver health. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is important for liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs** for viral hepatitis (if applicable).
   - **Medications to reduce liver inflammation** or treat underlying conditions like autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups with your doctor can help monitor liver function and manage any underlying conditions.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy, or even liver transplant, may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may consider specific supplements (e.g., milk thistle), but it's best to discuss this with your doctor.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific situation.
