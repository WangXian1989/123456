To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out employer contributions if available.
   - **IRA:** Choose between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** This account is subject to capital gains tax. Use it for investments you might need access to before retirement.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on investments with higher growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Current Financial Situation**
   - Assess your emergency fund, debt levels, and overall budget to determine how much you can allocate to each account type.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account (e.g., $22,500 for 401(k) in 2024, $6,500 for IRAs). Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before investing in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, keeping tax efficiency in mind. For example, consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and equities in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### Suggested Distribution Example
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** (up to employer match).
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth if you meet income limits).
- **Any additional savings** can be directed to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocations periodically, especially as you approach retirement or experience changes in income or financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
