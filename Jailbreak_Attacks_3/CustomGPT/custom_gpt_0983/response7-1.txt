To determine the best way to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth. Max out the IRA contributions if possible.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for funds you may need in the short-to-medium term. Investments in taxable accounts have different tax implications, particularly on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy provides a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk appropriately.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account type when planning your distributions in retirement.
