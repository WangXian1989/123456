To provide tailored advice on distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'll need to understand your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. 

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally has higher contribution limits and potential employer match; tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but flexibility in accessing funds; pays capital gains taxes on investment earnings.

2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Are you saving primarily for retirement, or do you need funds for short-term goals?

3. **Assess Risk Tolerance**:
   - Determine how much risk youâ€™re willing to take. Generally, 401(k) and IRA accounts can handle more aggressive strategies as they are long-term investments.

4. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Fully utilize 401(k) contributions, especially to get any employer match. Contribute to an IRA next.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments generating income that you might need soon.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment allocations based on market performance and any changes in your financial situation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts in retirement to minimize taxes.
