To effectively allocate your money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're in a high tax bracket now, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Debt Considerations**: Pay off high-interest debt before making significant investments. 

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, as withdrawals before age 59Â½ incur penalties.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your retirement timeline, diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for more liquid investments and consider tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Holding onto investments for over a year can reduce capital gains taxes.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocation based on your age, retirement timeline, and risk appetite. Younger investors can take more risks, while those nearing retirement should prioritize stability.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your specific goals and circumstances.
