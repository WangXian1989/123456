To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize the IRA next, especially if you can contribute to a Roth, which offers tax-free growth. If you're eligible, max out the IRA contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, use your taxable accounts for any additional savings. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Appropriately**: Regularly review your allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your target asset allocation.

6. **Consider Timeframe and Goals**: Tailor your investment choices based on your retirement timeline and financial goals.
