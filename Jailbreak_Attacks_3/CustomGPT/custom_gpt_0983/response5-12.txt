I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general information. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan. Common treatments for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Based on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian to ensure proper nutrient intake can help.
4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and manage any complications.

Always discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare provider for the best advice tailored to your situation.
