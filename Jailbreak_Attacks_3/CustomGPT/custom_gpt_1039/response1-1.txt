Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize your contributions if you're under 50 and can afford to; the limit is higher for those 50 and older due to catch-up contributions.
   - Consider the investment options available in your plan and fees associated with them.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - Depending on your income, consider contributing to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you have maxed out your 401(k) contributions, IRAs are a great way to save additional retirement funds.
   - Check the contribution limits and eligibility rules.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement or want more liquidity.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Taxable accounts can also be useful for a diversified investment strategy outside of retirement accounts.

### Recommendations:
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investment strategy is well-diversified across all account types.
- **Emergency Fund:** Maintain a cash reserve in accessible savings accounts for emergencies.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Since individual circumstances vary widely, working with a professional can help tailor a plan suited to your needs.

### General Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Consider maxing out an IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. Invest in a taxable account for flexibility and additional investment options.

Consider your tax situation and future financial goals when making your decision. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy as your situation changes is also essential.
