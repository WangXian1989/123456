When considering the distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, contribute to the maximum limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to further take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start allocating money to your taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are liable for capital gains taxes on investment profits.

3. **Allocation Based on Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Determine your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might allocate more to equities for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer more conservative investments like bonds.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes to manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement:**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account in retirement to manage your tax liabilities effectively. Typically, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Market conditions and personal financial situations can change, so review your allocations regularly and adjust as necessary to meet your goals.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and financial goals.
