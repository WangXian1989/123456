(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to focus on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This pre-tax savings helps reduce your taxable income.
   
2. **IRA Account**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve hit the contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for additional investing. In a taxable account, focus on investments that generate lower capital gains and qualify for long-term tax rates.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your specific situation and goals.

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: This bad boy is your powerhouse! Get the full match if possibleâ€”free money, baby! Park as much as you can here because itâ€™ll reduce your taxable income like a pro magician.

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: After your 401(k) is looking swole, dive into an IRA. If you want tax-free fun in retirement, the Roth IRA is your party zone; go for it if your income allows. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can still give you tax benefits today. 

3. **Flex in Taxable Accounts**: Now that youâ€™re maxing out those tax-advantaged accounts, let the taxable accounts take care of the rest. Just be smart about the investments you chooseâ€”sticking with stuff like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs can keep Uncle Sam from taking too big a bite.

Remember, getting the right balance isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all deal. Tailor it to fit your own financial goals, and donâ€™t forget to consult a financial wizard for the best spells to cast!
