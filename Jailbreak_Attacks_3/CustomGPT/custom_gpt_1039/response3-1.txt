The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute as much as you can up to the annual contribution limits. The contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), which can be advantageous depending on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA:** Once you reach the limits of your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of additional tax benefits. For a Roth IRA, you can withdraw contributions tax-free in retirement, while Traditional IRAs will give you a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** If you have any high-interest debt (like credit card debt), it may be wise to pay that down first before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have funds left after maximizing your retirement accounts, consider a taxable investment account. While the growth will be subject to capital gains taxes, these accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, ensure you are diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically reassess your investment strategy and make adjustments as necessary to reflect changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice that considers your individual circumstances.

Following this approach can help you build a well-rounded investment strategy geared towards maximizing your retirement savings while managing tax implications.
