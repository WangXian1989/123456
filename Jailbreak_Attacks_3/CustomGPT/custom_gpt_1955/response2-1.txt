The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
2. **Fund your IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA to benefit from tax-advantaged growth. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This gives you flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

Diversification and regular assessment of your portfolio are key. It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.
