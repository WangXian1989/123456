(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, it’s wise to maximize employer contributions to your 401(k) first, then focus on contributing to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. After that, any additional savings can be funneled into taxable accounts for more flexibility. It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
