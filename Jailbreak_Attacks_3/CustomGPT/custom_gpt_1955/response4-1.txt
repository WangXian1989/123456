When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize growth and minimize taxes:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer matches. This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're within income limits; enjoy tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or income, enabling you to take advantage of favorable tax rates on long-term capital gains.

Evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance to optimize your asset allocation across these accounts. Regularly review and adjust as necessary for changing market conditions and personal circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide tailored guidance.
