Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently over time. Aim to at least contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Income and Tax Bracket**: If you expect your tax rate in retirement to be lower, a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may be suitable. If you believe your rate will be higher, consider a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income, such as bonds or REITs, since their growth will benefit from the tax deferral. In taxable accounts, hold investments that produce capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate when you sell.

4. **Flexibility and Emergencies**: Maintain an adequate amount in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your investment strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that aligns with your specific goals and financial situation.
