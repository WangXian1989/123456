Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund the IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if it offers tax advantages. Depending on your income and the type of IRA, you may benefit from tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free with Roth accounts), making them ideal for higher-growth investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for your retirement withdrawal strategy. Typically, people withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation annually or when major life events occur (like changing jobs, marriage, etc.).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will align with your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax considerations.
