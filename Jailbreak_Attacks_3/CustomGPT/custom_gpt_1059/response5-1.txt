To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritizing pre-tax contributions to your 401(k) can be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, Roth IRAs (which are funded with after-tax dollars) might be preferable.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to manage risk and improve returns. You can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible for emergencies or short-term needs, so ensure you keep enough liquidity outside tax-advantaged accounts for unexpected expenses.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in financial goals. Monitor your investments routinely to ensure they align with your overall strategy.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation and long-term goals.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining a diverse and balanced portfolio, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
