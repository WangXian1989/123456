To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Decide whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit each year, especially if you can benefit from the tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Shorter-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access in the near term or for goals outside of retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or stocks, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Consider Your Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance across all account types. Stocks typically offer higher growth, while bonds are more stable.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to ensure you stay aligned with your investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Typically, you want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow as long as possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - **Personalized Guidance**: A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and tax circumstances.
