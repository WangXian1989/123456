The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Contribute to the 401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Max Out the IRA**: After securing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have tax advantages, so choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k)**: Once your IRA is funded, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, especially if you're aiming to maximize your retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or specific financial goals outside retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties, but they don’t have the same tax advantages.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, while 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).

6. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure your asset allocation is balanced across all accounts. This may involve different investments in each account based on tax efficiency.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly reassess your financial situation and goals, and adjust your contributions and allocations accordingly.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your individual circumstances.
