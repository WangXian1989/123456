Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of each type of account and how to approach distribution:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Advantages**: Often includes employer matching contributions, higher contribution limits.
   - **Strategy**: 
     - Max out contributions to get the full employer match first.
     - Consider contributing more if you’re in a high tax bracket to defer taxes.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types**: Traditional vs. Roth
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Strategy**:
     - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
     - Use Traditional IRAs for tax deductions if you need to lower your taxable income now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility with fewer restrictions on withdrawals.
   - **Strategy**:
     - Use for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a house, travel).
     - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize**:
  1. Max out the 401(k) employer match.
  2. Contribute to an IRA, focusing on Roth if beneficial.
  3. Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility.

### **Considerations**
- **Tax Impact**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax bracket.
- **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the allocation based on your risk appetite and investment timeline.

### **Regular Review**
- Annually review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
