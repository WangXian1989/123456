Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **401(k):** Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs, in particular, offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Use this account for more liquid needs and for investments you plan to hold for shorter periods.

### 3. **Investment Choices**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Choose a diversified investment mix based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Consider index funds, target-date funds, or a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments like ETFs or tax-managed funds to minimize annual tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**
   - **Younger Investors:** Focus more on growth through equities, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Near Retirement:** Shift towards more conservative investments, ensuring you're preserving capital.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, life events, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that considers your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for growth and minimizing tax liabilities.
