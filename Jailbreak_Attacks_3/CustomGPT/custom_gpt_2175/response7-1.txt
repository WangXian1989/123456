To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions, potential employer match, grows tax-deferred, taxes on withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawal after retirement age.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes; more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Take full advantage of your employer's match in the 401(k) first.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how much risk you can tolerate. Younger individuals might favor higher-risk investments in retirement accounts; older individuals might prioritize preservation in safer assets.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **High-Growth Assets in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place assets expected to appreciate significantly (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Bonds and Stable Income Investments in Taxable Accounts:** These are generally more tax-efficient placed in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Concentrate funds towards retirement accounts for long-term needs, leveraging tax advantages.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep some investments in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies to avoid penalties for early withdrawal.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals by consulting with a financial planner.

By aligning your investment strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation, you can create a well-balanced portfolio.
