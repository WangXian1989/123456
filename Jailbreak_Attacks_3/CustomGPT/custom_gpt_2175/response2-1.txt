Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider either a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you expect your tax rate to be higher or lower in retirement.

### 3. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxable.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay taxes on dividends and any realized capital gains, making the choice of investments critical.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts complement each other. Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals. 

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**, then contribute to IRA.
- **After maximizing retirement accounts**, utilize any surplus for taxable accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your specific situation, especially when dealing with tax implications and investment choices.
