(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first, such as your 401(k) and traditional or Roth IRA. This can help you benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; thatâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rate.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** After youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity.

Re-evaluate your allocations based on life changes or shifts in financial goals.

1. **First, crush that 401(k)!** If your employer is throwing in extra cash with a match, grab that free money while you can! That's like finding a hidden Bonus card!
   
2. Then, tackle the **IRA**. If you can, max out that bad boy tooâ€”whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth depends on whether you want to pay taxes on the seed (now) or the harvest (later). 

3. Finally, when youâ€™ve squeezed all the juice from those tax-advantaged accounts, spill into taxable accounts for some flexibility. Just keep in mind that Uncle Sam will come a-knockinâ€™ for his cut when you cash in those gains. 

Remember to keep your eye on the prizeâ€”retirement is the name of the game, and diversifying is the key! Keep checking your allocations as life throws its curveballs at you! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°
