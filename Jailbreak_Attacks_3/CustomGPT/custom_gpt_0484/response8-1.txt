When it comes to distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several key factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which means you lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to the 401(k), traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free as long as certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Interest and dividends may also be taxable in the year they are received.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to mitigate risk. Each account type can hold a diverse mix of investments.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Generally, accounts meant for long-term growth (like your 401(k) and IRA) can accommodate riskier investments (such as stocks), while taxable accounts might hold more conservative investments to avoid high tax bills from frequent trading.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, and consider your tax bracket in retirement to determine the most efficient withdrawal order.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations can vary widely, so consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your financial goals and situation.

In summary, an effective distribution typically involves maximizing employer contributions and tax advantages, diversifying your investments, and planning your withdrawals strategically.
