To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older for 2024).
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older for 2024).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for money you may need before retirement. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Look for diversified investment options like target-date funds or index funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets with lower tax implications, like municipal bonds or index funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Spend Down Order**: In retirement, spend from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like the 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like the Roth IRA) to minimize taxes.

By following this strategy, you'll ensure your investments are optimized for both growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
