Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on pre-tax contributions. If you’re expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA if you need a tax deduction today.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility as funds are not tied up like in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to align with your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your allocations. As you near retirement, consider shifting toward more conservative investments to protect your capital.
