To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Max out contributions to benefit from tax advantages. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more into accounts with tax advantages (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need sooner, as they offer more flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place stocks or index funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Investments**: Hold bonds or real estate in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Adjust allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changing financial goals.

### Summary
1. Prioritize 401(k) contributions, especially for employer matching.
2. Maximize IRA contributions for tax advantages.
3. Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage and optimize your investment distribution for future growth and tax efficiency.
