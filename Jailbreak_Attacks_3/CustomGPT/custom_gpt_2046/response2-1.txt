To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer matches. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for short-term goals or after-tax investments, ideally focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Medium-Term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and access.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have liquid funds in a savings account.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Age**
   - Younger investors might be more aggressive in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors may shift towards more conservative investments as retirement nears.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

### 5. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to maximize benefits without penalties.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, or tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions first (up to the match)**
- **Contribute to IRA (Roth or traditional based on your tax situation)**
- **Invest any extra funds in a taxable account for flexibility**

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing for taxes.
