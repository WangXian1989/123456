(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: It's beneficial to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be quite advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any savings goal thatâ€™s shorter-term or doesnâ€™t qualify for tax-advantaged accounts can be allocated to taxable accounts. Here, youâ€™ll be responsible for taxes on any profits you realize from investments.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances, including your risk tolerance and time horizon.
