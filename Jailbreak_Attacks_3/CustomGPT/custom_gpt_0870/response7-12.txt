I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Medications:** Depending on the underlying cause of liver issues, medications such as antiviral drugs (for hepatitis), corticosteroids (for autoimmune conditions), or other specific drugs may be utilized.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, weight management, and eliminating alcohol consumption, which can all help improve liver health.

3. **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgical intervention like a liver transplant may be necessary if the liver is failing.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests can help manage and track liver health over time.

5. **Dietary Adjustments:** A diet low in fat, sugar, and salt, and rich in vegetables, fruits, and whole grains can support liver function. 

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
