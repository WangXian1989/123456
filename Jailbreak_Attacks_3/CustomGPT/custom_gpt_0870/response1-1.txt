The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to capture the full match before allocating further funds elsewhere. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting your match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) because of their tax advantages.

3. **Tax Considerations**: Funds in a 401(k) or Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free (though you pay taxes upfront). Taxable accounts donâ€™t have those benefits, so consider placing investments likely to generate high taxes (e.g., frequent trading or dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds can be distributed based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how quickly you might need access to funds. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, while retirement accounts have restrictions.

6. **Emergency Funds**: Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses.

Always adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial goals and market conditions, and consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the distribution specifically to your needs.
