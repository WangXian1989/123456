I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. For any liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Improving diet by avoiding alcohol, fatty foods, and incorporating fruits and vegetables.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery:** In cases of severe liver disease, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.
5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies:** Some may find support in milk thistle or other herbal treatments, but these should be discussed with a doctor first.

Please make sure to speak with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific needs.
