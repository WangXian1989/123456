To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications:**
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - Be mindful of contribution limits: For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Asset Allocation Based on Account Type:**
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from long-term capital gains and tax deferral.
   - Use your taxable account for more stable investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to manage capital gains taxes, as these may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Develop a long-term plan for when you intend to withdraw funds. Early withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may incur penalties, while withdrawals from taxable accounts can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes.

By utilizing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution while considering the unique tax implications and growth potential of each account type. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
