To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and increase your contributions. Aim to reach the annual limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide more flexibility, as you can access your funds without penalties at any time. Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the different tax implications for each account type. For instance, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate, while short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

7. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors can afford to take more risks, typically allocating more towards stocks, while older investors might lean towards more stable investments like bonds.

8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically assess your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio according to market changes and your financial goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment strategy tailored to your financial needs and retirement goals.
