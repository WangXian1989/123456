Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Prioritize maxing out your contributions to maximize tax-deferred growth.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: 
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Check if you qualify for deductible contributions based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access in the short term, as they provide more flexibility than retirement accounts.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to manage capital gains.

4. **Balance Between Accounts**: 
   - Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to protect them from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or conservative investments that generate taxable interest.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Assess your current and expected future tax rates. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates.

6. **Goal-Oriented Approach**: 
   - Align your distribution with your financial goals. For short-term needs, lean towards taxable accounts; for long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and rebalance to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
