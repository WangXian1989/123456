Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax) based on your income and tax strategy. If eligible, max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k) contributions (the limit for 2024 is $23,000; $30,500 if you’re 50 or older), prioritize this next.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may incur higher taxes (e.g., stocks, ETFs) since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Consider tax-efficient funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you also maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account for short-term liquidity needs.

5. **Diversification**: Keep an eye on diversifying your investments within each account type to balance risk and return.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, life stages, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
