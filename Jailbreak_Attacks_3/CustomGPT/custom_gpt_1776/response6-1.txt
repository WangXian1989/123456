Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if eligible. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains rather than income. This helps you manage your tax situation more efficiently since capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. High-growth investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on short-term gains.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals from each account type during retirement, possibly starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### Strategy Example
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income (max out to employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts 

This framework should provide a solid foundation for your investment strategy. Consult with a financial advisor to customize it further based on your unique situation.
