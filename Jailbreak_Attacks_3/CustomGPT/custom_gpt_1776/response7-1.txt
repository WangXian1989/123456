Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important strategy for optimizing your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some considerations to help you decide how to allocate your contributions:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contribution limits are generally higher than IRAs.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. They can be useful for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA (if you qualify) or a Traditional IRA for tax efficiency.
   - **Contribute to Taxable Accounts:** Once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Utilize 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions to reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Favor Roth IRAs for tax-free growth, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Capital Gains in Taxable Accounts**: Be aware of how dividends and capital gains will be taxed in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the near term. Reserve retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Retirement Age & Expected Withdrawals**: Align contributions with your expected retirement age and when you plan to start withdrawing funds.

### 5. **Rebalance and Monitor Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across these accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match and aim to max it out if possible.
- **IRA:** Max out to either a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining funds here, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds).

### Conclusion
Your ideal allocation will depend on individual circumstances, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
