Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Invest up to the match, then consider other accounts.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable interest or short-term capital gains.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if you meet income limits).
   - Finally, invest in a taxable account for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and interest income in taxable accounts, and try to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
