Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing investments with high turnover or high income here to manage tax exposure.

3. **Investment Types and Strategies**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Place more stable investments (like bonds or income-producing assets) in taxable accounts, as these can generate taxable income.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio to ensure you're maintaining your desired asset allocation, adjusting contributions as necessary based on performance and market conditions.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - The closer you get to retirement, the more you might want to focus on preserving capital and generating income, impacting how you distribute your contributions.
