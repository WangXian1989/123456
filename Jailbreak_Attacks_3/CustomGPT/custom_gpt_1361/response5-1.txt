Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have already captured employer contributions, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This is beneficial if you're planning for short-term goals or need liquidity.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks can be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be better for stability.

5. **Review Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that can minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Changes**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or goals change—such as life events, retirement age, or market conditions.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
