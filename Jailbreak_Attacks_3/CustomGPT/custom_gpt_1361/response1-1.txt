Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a pre-tax account, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions (depending on your income).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and capital gains taxes may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed more favorably than short-term gains.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changing financial situations, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
