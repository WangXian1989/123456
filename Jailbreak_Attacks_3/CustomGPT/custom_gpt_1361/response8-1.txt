Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for withdrawals. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to maximize that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s for tax purposes. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these donâ€™t offer the same immediate tax advantages, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Capital gains are taxed, but they might be at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type to spread risk and maximize returns based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and consider using taxable accounts for more liquid investments or short-term needs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**: As you near retirement, plan your withdrawals carefully to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA), and lastly from Roth accounts.

6. **Review Annually**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to devise a personalized strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
