Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is effectively "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages here, but you can control when to realize gains and losses. You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term, higher-growth investments since they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively on capital gains.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you will access your funds in retirement. Taking money from tax-advantaged accounts later can keep you in a lower tax bracket.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level across all accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you navigate your specific situation, especially for tax implications.

A balanced approach, keeping in mind your long-term goals and current financial situation, will help you make the most of these accounts.
