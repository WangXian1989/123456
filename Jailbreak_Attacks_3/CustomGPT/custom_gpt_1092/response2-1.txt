The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Then, consider maximizing your contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, focus on your IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling investments. Consider using them for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: These are great for holding bonds or other income-producing investments, as you won’t pay taxes on that income until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on holding assets with low turnover (like index funds) to minimize taxes, as well as tax-efficient investments (such as municipal bonds).

4. **Evaluate Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to focus more on stable investments within your 401(k) and IRA, while using taxable accounts for growth-oriented investments.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments to minimize risk.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or life events.

7. **Consult a Professional**:
   - It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your objectives and tax situation.

By considering these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
