Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for tax benefits.

### 2. Consider Your Investment Goals
- **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments.
- **Short-Term Needs:** Utilize taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner, where you can access money without penalties.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments to maximize growth potential.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Monitor and Adjust
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Check your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing or selling investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- For personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

This strategy ensures you're leveraging tax advantages while maintaining flexibility for your investment needs.
