The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can reduce your taxable income, especially if it's a traditional 401(k).
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA next. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start allocating funds to taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or for accessing funds without penalties before retirement.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you think you'll be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be the better option.

5. **Diversity of Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes in all accounts to spread risk. 

6. **Adjust for Your Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might lean towards more aggressive investments (like stocks) in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may prefer more conservative choices (like bonds).

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute and as markets fluctuate, routinely check your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored distribution strategy that meets your specific needs.

It's essential to review and adjust your allocation regularly based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.
