It's important to consider several factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some key considerations and strategies to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA also allows pre-tax contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for after-tax contributions. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA in retirement could be tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell. Consider holding investments for at least a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Account Growth Potential**:
   - Maximize contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) up to the contribution limits before investing in a taxable account.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties or tax implications when needed, especially before retirement age.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Your age and proximity to retirement can also influence how you allocate funds. Younger individuals might prioritize growth-oriented assets in 401(k) or IRAs, while those closer to retirement might shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially "free money".

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs before investing in taxable accounts.
- **Allocate to 401(k) for Long-Term Growth**: Invest available funds in your 401(k), particularly if you receive an employer match.
- **Utilize IRAs Wisely**: Depending on your eligibility, max out your traditional IRA or Roth IRA contributions. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable brokerage account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best strategy depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
