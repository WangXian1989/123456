When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. If your employer offers a match, prioritize maximizing that contribution.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they also offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals. 401(k)s and IRAs are more suited for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be used for both short and long-term investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k)s is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

4. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Your investment strategy should align with your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts may allow for more aggressive investments, while taxable accounts can be adjusted for risk based on your timeline for withdrawal.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you diversify your investments across all account types to manage risk effectively. Each account can hold different asset types based on your overall investment strategy.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** to at least the employer match, then consider the IRA.
- If you have the ability to save more:
   - **Prioritize a Roth IRA** if your income allows and you expect higher taxes in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or for more accessible funds.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA: 30% 
- Taxable Account: 20%

This allocation could change based on personal financial goals, age, and market conditions, so regularly review and adjust as necessary. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
