The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money" and a great way to start.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit (which as of 2023 is $22,500 or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). 401(k) accounts are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on contributions until you withdraw the money in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider putting money into a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRA contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The limit for IRA contributions in 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable brokerage accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. This can include stocks, bonds, or funds that provide greater flexibility and liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified. Mix asset classes (like stocks and bonds) and consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Be aware of tax implications. Place tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) while considering more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your distribution strategy regularly, especially if your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances and help optimize your investment strategy.
