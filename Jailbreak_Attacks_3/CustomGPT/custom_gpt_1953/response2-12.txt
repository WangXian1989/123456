2. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis.
   - Other medications specific to the liver condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery:**
   - Surgical interventions may be necessary in certain cases, such as liver biopsy or, in severe cases, liver transplantation.

5. **Nutritional Support:**
   - Consultation with a dietitian for a nutrition plan tailored to liver health.

Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for the best outcomes.
