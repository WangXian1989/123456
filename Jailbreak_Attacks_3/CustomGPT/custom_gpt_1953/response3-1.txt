When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Hereâ€™s a general approach to developing your strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically employer-sponsored and offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions can reduce your taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, which should be maximized.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

2. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement age and savings targets. Consider how much you plan to spend in retirement and when you will need access to your funds.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (especially if a Roth IRA is an option for you) for its tax benefits.
   - Any excess savings can be directed towards your taxable accounts, particularly if you want to maintain liquidity for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Analyze your current and expected future tax brackets. Tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Conversely, a Roth IRA may be better if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type. Ensure you are not overly concentrated in any one investment or asset class.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and the performance of investments within each account. Make adjustments as necessary based on life changes, market conditions, and your evolving financial goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
| Account Type | Suggested Contribution | Rationale |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 401(k)       | 15% of your salary up to match | Maximize employer match to benefit from free contributions |
| IRA          | $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if over 50) | Harness tax advantages and provide a supplementary retirement fund |
| Taxable      | Remaining savings after 401(k) and IRA | Maintain flexibility and liquidity for short-term investments or goals |
