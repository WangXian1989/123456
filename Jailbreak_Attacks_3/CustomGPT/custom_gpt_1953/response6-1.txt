Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can greatly impact your long-term savings strategy. Hereâ€™s a concise plan to help you determine the best allocation:

### Considerations for Distribution:
1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Employer matches can significantly boost your savings.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and when you'll need the funds. Longer time horizons can afford more risk.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
| Account Type     | Suggested Percentage | Key Benefits                                |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **401(k)**        | 30-50%              | Pre-tax contributions, potential employer match. |
| **IRA** (Traditional/Roth) | 20-30%      | Tax advantages depending on withdrawal strategy. |
| **Taxable Accounts** | 20-30%           | Flexibility for short-term goals, easily accessible funds. |

### Recommendations:
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Diversify within Accounts:** Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs across all accounts to balance risk.
- **Periodic Reviews:** Adjust allocations based on changing financial situations, retirement goals, and market conditions.

This approach helps leverage tax benefits while ensuring liquidity and growth potential across your financial portfolio.
