(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, especially if you want tax-free growth or to lower your taxable income, respectively.
3. **Continue with 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to build your retirement savings further.
4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional funds, allocate them to taxable accounts, which provide flexibility and can be useful for short-term goals.
5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Ensure your investments are diversified across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First!** If your employer throws in matching contributions, grab that cash ASAP! Free money is the best kind.
2. **IRA Time!** Once youâ€™ve snagged the match, dive into an IRA. Roth IRA? Great for tax-free growth later! Traditional IRA? Perfect if you need a tax break now.
3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After maxing out that IRA, go back to your 401(k) and keep the retirement train rolling. 
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Want to keep some cash flowing for fun stuff or short-term plans? Put extra funds into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re less restrictive and can be accessed anytime.
5. **Mix It Up**: Donâ€™t forget to spread out your investments. A mix keeps you safe from market craziness.

Basically, hit those accounts in this order and youâ€™re golden! Just keep an eye on your goals and maybe chat with a money wizard (financial advisor) to tweak things. Happy investing!
