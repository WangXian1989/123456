When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with taxes paid upon withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate higher taxes in the future, this may be advantageous.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k):** Maximum contribution limits for 2024 are $23,000 (under age 50) and $30,500 (age 50 and over).
- **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (under age 50) and $7,500 (age 50+).
- Be sure to max out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) first.

### 3. Time Horizon and Goals
- If your retirement is far off, prioritize accounts with tax-advantaged growth (like 401(k) and IRAs).
- For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. Investment Strategy
- Diversify your investments among all accounts to reduce risk.
- Consider the different investment options available in each account type and how they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on eligibility, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Choose Roth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional funds here for liquidity and flexibility, especially for shorter-term needs or goals.

### Final Thoughts
It’s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances, including income level, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Balancing contributions among these accounts effectively can optimize your tax situation and investment growth over time.
