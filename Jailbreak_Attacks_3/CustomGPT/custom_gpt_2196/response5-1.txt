(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Additionally, consider maxing out the 401(k) once you've met your matching contributions, especially if it has low-cost investment options.

2. **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you might prefer a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. IRA accounts often offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be more suitable for short-term goals or for additional savings that exceed your tax-advantaged contribution limits. This is also a place to hold investments that generate favorable capital gains treatment.

Review your overall asset allocation and rebalance as necessary. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer is throwing in free money with a match, for the love of all thatâ€™s financial, grab that! Max it out if you can. Thatâ€™s basically like finding cash in your couch cushions â€” itâ€™s pure gold. Go for the lowest expense ratios here; nobody likes being eaten alive by fees.

2. **IRA**: Next up, the IRA. Whether itâ€™s traditional or Roth, get some cash flowing into this bad boy. These are sweet spots for tax advantages, so play it right. If your income isnâ€™t through the roof, a Roth IRA can be your ticket to tax-free growth. Seriously, who wants to deal with taxes in retirement? No one!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for those extra funds that donâ€™t fit into the tax-advantaged slots, bust out a taxable account. This is where you can play around a bit more and access your dough if you need it. Plus, you can cherry-pick investments with lower capital gains taxes. Just keep an eye on those realized gains; nobody wants Uncle Sam sniffing around when youâ€™re trying to celebrate your financial victories.

Remember, keep an eye on your total asset allocation and rebalance when things get wonky. And hey, consulting a financial advisor is a smart move if you're feeling overwhelmed. Now go out there and dominate those accounts!
