To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will influence how you allocate your funds.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions and potential employer matching. Best for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Good for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses set aside in a liquid form outside of these accounts.

4. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA, if you qualify based on income limits.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and to respond to market changes.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications. Taxable accounts might be better for investments you plan to sell sooner, while long-term investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity for short-term needs, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
