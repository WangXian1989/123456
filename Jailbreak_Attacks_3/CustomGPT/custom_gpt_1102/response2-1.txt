Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) before adding significant amounts to a taxable account. This helps reduce your taxable income.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified within each account type. Consider risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: If you may need access to money before retirement, keep some funds in taxable accounts, as they allow for withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
