Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your IRAs (Roth or traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit you long-term.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, meaning youâ€™ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs may also provide tax deductions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings (dividends, interest, capital gains) are taxed annually, so use these for short-term needs or after-tax growth.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Make sure you have a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy:** For withdrawals in retirement, you may want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on market conditions and your changing financial situation.
