To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
  - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA due to tax deferral and, in the case of a Roth IRA, potential tax-free withdrawals.
  
### Contribution Limits
- **Understand Limits:**
  - Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) contributions can be up to $22,500 for 2024, plus a catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

### Investment Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
  - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts because gains will be taxed at a lower rate or not at all.
  - Use the taxable account for less aggressive investments or those that produce income, as this can impact your tax situation.

### Emergency Fund
- **Maintain Liquid Assets:**
  - Keep a portion in your taxable accounts for easy access to funds in case of emergencies.

### Rebalancing
- **Regular Review:**
  - Periodically reassess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

By following these principles, you can enhance your overall financial strategy while maximizing growth and minimizing taxes.
