Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, liquidity, and investment goals. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your eligibility, prioritize maxing out your IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on holding higher growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and Traditional IRA, as you won't pay taxes until withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) here, as they can be more tax-efficient. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 3. **Balance for Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have a portion of your money in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. This grants greater access without incurring penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Less aggressive investments may be better suited for your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review & Rebalance**
   - Monitor your allocations periodically to ensure they reflect your changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions, focused on employer match and long-term growth.
- **IRA:** 25% of total savings, split as needed between Traditional and Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25% for liquidity, focusing on lower turnover, tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Your ideal distribution will depend on your specific situation, including your income level, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your personal financial picture.
