(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it's wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, you can maximize your IRA contributions to take advantage of tax-advantaged growth. Finally, you can allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. This strategy maximizes tax efficiency and potential growth. It's also advisable to consider your investment time horizon and risk tolerance when making these decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
