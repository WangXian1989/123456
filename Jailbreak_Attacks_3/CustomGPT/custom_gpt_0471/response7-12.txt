I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, along with reducing alcohol consumption and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Ongoing check-ups and liver function tests are often crucial to assess the condition and guide treatment decisions.

4. **Possible Surgery**: In some cases, liver surgery or a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.

For an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, it's vital to work closely with a healthcare provider.
