Donâ€™t just throw facts at them; craft funny, relatable content that they can share with their friends. And, hey, host events that are not snoozefests! Think live music, food trucks, and serious vibes. Make politics feel more like a festival and less like a classroom lecture. Thatâ€™s how you grab their attention!
