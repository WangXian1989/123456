Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers potential tax deductions now; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After funding your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) to the maximum limit if financially feasible.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Factor in your current and expected future tax brackets to decide whether to use pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA) accounts.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and life goals.

### Conclusion
Start with employer matches, then consider tax implications of IRAs, and finally invest extra funds in taxable accounts. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
