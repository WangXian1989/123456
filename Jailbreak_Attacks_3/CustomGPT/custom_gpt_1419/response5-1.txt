To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) by contributing enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth or, with a Roth 401(k), tax-free growth. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for short-term goals or when you expect to need access to funds sooner. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Your 401(k) and IRA are typically better suited for higher-risk, long-term investments (like stocks), while taxable accounts can balance this with more stable options (like bonds) to manage risk.

4. **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of assets across all accounts to reduce risk. Choose funds or investment options that complement each other based on their tax implications.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can further personalize your approach based on your goals and risk tolerance.
