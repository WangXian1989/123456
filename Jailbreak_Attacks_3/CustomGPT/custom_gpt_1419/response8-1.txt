When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out contributions for tax advantages, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Favor investments that may generate ordinary income, like bonds or REITs, since you'll defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it might be wise to prioritize 401(k) and traditional IRAs now and consider Roth contributions if you believe you'll be in a higher bracket.

4. **Distributions Planning:**
   - Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts last, as they will be taxed when you take distributions.
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Reassess and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
