To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to reach the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current tax bracket and retirement goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that can be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Consider Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider prioritizing paying it down before investing aggressively.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account.

7. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals, ensuring long-term investments are placed in tax-advantaged accounts while more liquid funds can remain in taxable accounts.

By evaluating your current financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance, you can create an optimal strategy for distributing your funds. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
