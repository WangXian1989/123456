I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment depends on the specific liver condition. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and imaging tests to monitor liver function and health.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver surgery or a transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: 
   - Nutritional support or therapies to manage symptoms.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
