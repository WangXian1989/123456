To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Next, prioritize contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). The annual contribution limit is usually lower than a 401(k), but it's often beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Boost 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), aiming to reach the maximum annual limit if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Within each account, tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and goals. Generally, use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth assets (stocks) and keep lower-growth assets (bonds) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in income, contribution limits, and personal financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
