Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers a match for the 401(k). This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions (when applicable), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax benefits on contributions. However, capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments at a profit. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Evaluate Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re investing for a long-term goal (like retirement), prioritize the accounts with the best tax advantages (401(k) and IRA).
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains, while placing more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - As market conditions change and your portfolio grows, periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Utilize Withdrawals Wisely**:
   - Once in retirement, strategize your withdrawals to minimize tax liability. For instance, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing, balancing your tax burden over time.

6. **Consult Financial Advice**:
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and individual financial situations, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and long-term financial goals.

By strategically distributing your contributions and investments, you can optimize your savings and minimize potential tax liabilities.
