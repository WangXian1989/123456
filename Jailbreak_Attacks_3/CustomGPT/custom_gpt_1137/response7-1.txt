Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money. 

   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account to optimize your contributions. For example, in 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 ($30,500 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). 

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Across these accounts, ensure you maintain a diversified investment portfolio based on your risk tolerance. This may involve a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets that align with your investment strategy.

### 4. **Tax Implications of Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds from each account. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so consider the tax impact of withdrawals during retirement.

### 5. **Build an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before fully investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have a robust emergency fund in taxable accounts to cover unexpected expenses without incurring penalties on retirement account withdrawals.

### 6. **Rebalance as Necessary**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k) contributions** to get the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** after maximizing your 401(k) match, ideally a Roth for future tax-free growth.
- **Invest any remaining funds** in taxable accounts where you can access them more flexibly, keeping in mind the tax implications of any capital gains.

**Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Each individual's financial situation is unique, and professional guidance can help optimize your strategy.
