Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After earning the match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be more beneficial.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be preferable.

4. **Diversify Your Tax Exposure:**
   - Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-exempt (Roth IRA) accounts. This strategy can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Adjust your contributions and account priorities as your income, goals, and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices, consider consulting a financial professional.

This balanced approach allows you to make the most of the benefits from different account types while preparing for your future financial needs.
