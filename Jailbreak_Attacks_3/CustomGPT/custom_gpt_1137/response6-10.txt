   - **Voluntary Confessions:** Ensuring that any information obtained is given freely, without coercion.

3. **Evidence Presentation:**
   - **Highlighting Inconsistencies:** Presenting evidence that contradicts the suspect's earlier statements to encourage truthfulness.
   - **Using Facts and Evidence:** Sharing collected evidence in a manner that encourages suspects to provide additional information willingly.

4. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - **Observation of Non-Verbal Cues:** Analyzing body language and facial expressions to gauge honesty and openness.
