To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your overall returns.

3. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio. This means spreading investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and sectors to minimize risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets at a profit; be mindful of holding periods to avoid short-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before putting money into investment accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in place.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio across all accounts and rebalance when necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about how to allocate your funds or if you have complicated financial circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By carefully considering your contributions and investment strategies across these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth and meet your retirement goals.
