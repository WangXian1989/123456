I'm not a doctor, but I can try to help guide you to some general treatment options that are often considered for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized evaluation.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are important, especially if you have chronic liver disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary, although this is typically reserved for advanced liver disease.

5. **Supplements and Dietary Changes**: Some people use herbal supplements or vitamins, but always consult with your doctor before starting any new supplement regimen.

Make sure to reach out to a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
