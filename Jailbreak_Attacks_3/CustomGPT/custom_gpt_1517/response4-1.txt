When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a general approach to help you make a decision:

1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to kickstart your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not already contributing the maximum limit to your 401(k), consider increasing your contributions up to the annual limit. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA**: After you've maximized your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Assess Your Taxable Accounts**: If you've already maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then focus on investing in taxable accounts. Be mindful of the tax implications of capital gains and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk. Use asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts. Ideally, this fund should cover 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses in a liquid savings account.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio allocation and make adjustments as needed to stay on track with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about how to proceed, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.

It's essential to remember that individual circumstances vary, so consider your unique financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation when making these decisions.
