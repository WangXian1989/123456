The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, try to max out your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now with taxable withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - Before investing, ensure you've paid off any high-interest debt, as the interest on such debt can outweigh potential investment gains.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before allocating significant funds to investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. You can hold various investments here, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell assets.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help reduce risk. Generally, consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts while holding more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

6. **Revisit and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes and aligning your investments with your financial goals.
