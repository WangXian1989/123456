1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low-fat, high-fiber)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.

4. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases or liver failure.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people find certain vitamins and herbs helpful (consult your doctor first).

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
