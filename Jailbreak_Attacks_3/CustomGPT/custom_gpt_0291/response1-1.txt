Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the investment options available and fees associated with your plan.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you stay within annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for shorter-term goals or if you expect to access money before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before maximizing retirement accounts.
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts first.
- **Diversification**: Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk.

### Example Order of Operations:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute to the match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions.
3. **401(k)**: Increase contributions up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds.

### Review Regularly
- Reassess your asset allocation and contributions annually or when your financial situation changes.
