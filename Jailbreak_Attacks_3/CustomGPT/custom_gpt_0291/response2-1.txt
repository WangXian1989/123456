Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Take advantage of any employer match.
   - Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible):**
   - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Good for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Use Traditional IRA to Supplement:**
   - Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Good for funds you may need before retirement, as you can withdraw without penalties.
   - Focus on investments with lower capital gains and dividends to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider bond investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid tax on interest income.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Reassess your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.
