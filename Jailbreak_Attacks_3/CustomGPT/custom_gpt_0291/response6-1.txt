To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Depending on eligibility, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here, as youâ€™ll incur taxes on gains.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on higher-growth assets (like stocks) since they benefit more from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

### 3. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly reassess and adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in a high-yield savings account before investing excess cash.

### 5. **Long-term Goal Alignment**
   - Consider your retirement timeline and risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate funds.
