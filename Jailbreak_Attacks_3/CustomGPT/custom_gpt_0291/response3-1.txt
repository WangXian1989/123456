The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Use this for a mix of bonds and stocks, or even target-date funds tailored to your retirement age.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as income.
   - Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts have capital gains taxes; long-term holdings are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: If retirement is many years away, lean more towards aggressive investments. As retirement approaches, shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
