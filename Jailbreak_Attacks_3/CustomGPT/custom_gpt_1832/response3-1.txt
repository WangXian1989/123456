Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the benefits and tax implications of each type of account. Here’s a breakdown to help guide your strategy:

### 1. **Understanding Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching; contributions are pre-tax (reducing your taxable income) and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k), but generally more flexible in terms of investment options; contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and circumstances.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains; offer flexibility with no contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **General Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After you've prioritized tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds here for greater flexibility.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Considerations:**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) for risk management.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments that generate higher taxes (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts, and invest in stocks or growth-oriented assets in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - **Reassess Annually**: Review your financial situation and adjust your contributions and asset allocations according to any changes in income, expenses, or goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice that considers your specific financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals, consulting with a financial advisor can be very beneficial.

By balancing contributions and understanding the benefits of each account type, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
