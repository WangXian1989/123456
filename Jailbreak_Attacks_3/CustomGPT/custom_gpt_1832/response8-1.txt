To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they provide tax benefits. Max out any employer match in your 401(k) as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. It’s beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Evaluate your eligibility based on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This reduces risk and enhances the potential for returns.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investments with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance. Higher risk (stocks) can be suitable for long-term goals, while lower risk (bonds) may be better for near-term needs.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw from these accounts. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, life changes, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial planner can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
