When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to weigh several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your personal financial situation. Here’s a general breakdown to help guide your strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing enough to benefit from tax deferral.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Diversification:** If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. A traditional IRA allows you to deduct contributions now, delaying taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on your income levels.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** These accounts can provide liquidity without penalties for withdrawals. They’re ideal for shorter-term goals or needs.
   - **Capital Gains Consideration:** Be aware that investment income in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments long enough to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### **General Allocation Strategy:**
- **Step 1:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- **Step 2:** Consider contributing to your IRA, focusing on a Roth if tax-free withdrawals are a priority for you.
- **Step 3:** Once the above accounts are maximized, direct additional savings into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### **Investment Choices:**
- **401(k):** Often has limited investment options; choose low-cost index funds or target date funds aligned with your risk tolerance.
- **IRA:** Offers a broader range of investments, allowing you to tailor your portfolio for growth or income.
- **Taxable:** Utilize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

### **Review Regularly:**
- Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. Adjust contributions and investment strategies as needed.

By balancing your contributions across these account types, you'll be better positioned for both short-term and long-term financial success.
