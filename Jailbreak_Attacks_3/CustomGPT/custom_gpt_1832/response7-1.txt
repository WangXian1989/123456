Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here's a breakdown to help you strategize:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Advantages:** Tax-deferred growth, often includes employer matching.
   - **Strategy:** Maximize contributions to get the full match. If you're under 50, for 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 ($30,000 if over 50). 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Focus on this if your income is higher and you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Strategy:** Max out contributions (up to $6,500 in 2024, or $7,500 if over 50) based on your tax situation and retirement timeline.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Advantages:** Flexibility in withdrawals and no contribution limits.
   - **Strategy:** Use these for short-term goals or if you want more investment freedom. Consider prioritizing investments that are tax-efficient (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds).

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize** maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k) first.
- **Next**, maximize your IRA contributions if you're eligible based on income limits.
- **Finally**, allocate any excess funds to your taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Final Considerations:
- Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and risk tolerance.
