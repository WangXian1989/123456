To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. 
   - **IRA:** Offers tax advantages depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages for contributions, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds at any time without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Matching:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After getting the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (if eligible) or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Use tax-efficient strategies: for example, hold stocks that have the potential for high growth in tax-advantaged accounts (to avoid capital gains taxes when sold) and keep more stable, lesser-appreciating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Ensure that the overall allocation of stocks, bonds, and other assets meets your desired strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, consider tax implications of withdrawals. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

7. **Regular Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your long-term financial objectives and adjust as needed based on market performance or changes in your financial situation.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
