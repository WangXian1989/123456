Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, particularly if you receive a company match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider opening or contributing to a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility and liquidity, but keep in mind capital gains taxes on investments.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep assets that benefit from long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of financial planning and tax implications, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This strategy helps maximize tax efficiency while ensuring growth and liquidity for your financial goals.
