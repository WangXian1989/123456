Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored 401(k)**:
   - **Match First**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **Maximize Contribution**: Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible, as 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Fund a Traditional or Roth IRA**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be beneficial since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Consider maxing out your IRA contribution after your 401(k) match to further benefit from tax-advantaged growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Savings for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for specific financial goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains and dividends, which can help manage taxes on your investments.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and within accounts to manage risk and optimize returns based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market conditions, changing goals, or life events.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary to maximize company match.
- **IRA**: Subsequent contributions to max out annual IRA limits.
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings focus on taxable accounts for liquidity or short-term needs.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.
