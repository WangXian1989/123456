Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the requirements.

### 2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings, as they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need sooner. Since you'll be paying taxes on any gains here, consider more conservative investments to mitigate risks.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) for long-term accounts due to tax deferral benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more stable investments (bonds, dividend stocks), which are taxed at lower rates, to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Remember that 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Plan your withdrawals wisely to avoid higher tax brackets in retirement.
   - **Capital Gains**: Qualifying for lower rates on long-term capital gains in taxable accounts by holding investments for more than a year can be advantageous.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on market performance and life changes.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach—maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first and managing risk in taxable accounts—will likely yield the best long-term results. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
