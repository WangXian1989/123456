To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you are in your peak earning years.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free in retirement (Roth). Choose based on your current tax bracket versus expected retirement bracket. 

3. **Diversify Investments**: Across accounts, ensure your investments are diversified in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Hold investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Be wary of short-term capital gains; prioritize holding assets for the long term to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This strategy helps optimize tax benefits while providing flexibility in managing your investments.
