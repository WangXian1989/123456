Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, particularly if your employer matches. This gives you tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility but comes with capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Keep an eye on asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help balance growth and risk.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Evaluate the fees associated with each account type, as high fees can eat into your returns.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
