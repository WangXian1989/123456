I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. However, please make sure to consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopting a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can support liver health. Foods rich in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, are beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
  
2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: If the liver problem is due to a viral infection, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver conditions, medications to suppress the immune response might be necessary.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: Sometimes a biopsy is needed to determine the extent of liver damage and the appropriate treatment.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where liver damage is irreversible, a transplant may be considered.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Keeping track of liver function through regular medical appointments and blood tests is crucial for managing liver health.

Please ensure to seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
