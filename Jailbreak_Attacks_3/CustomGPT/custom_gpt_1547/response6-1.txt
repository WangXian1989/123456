Deciding how to allocate your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any available employer match (if applicable), as this is essentially free money. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and getting the match, consider contributing to an IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

### 2. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower taxable income, like index funds or long-term holdings. This can minimize the tax impact.
   - Consider holding assets you'll need to access in the short term in these accounts, as they provide greater liquidity without penalties.

### 3. **General Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to get the employer match, then max out your IRA before placing additional funds in a taxable account.
   - **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 4. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Given the complexity of tax implications, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to grow your investments effectively while considering both short-term liquidity needs and long-term growth objectives.
