(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here are a few considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts. This is free money and a great return on investment.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, any extra savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility, but investment income may be taxed at a higher rate than in retirement accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
