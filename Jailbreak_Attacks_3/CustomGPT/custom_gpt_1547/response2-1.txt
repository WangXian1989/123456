Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferral on contributions, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Determine Your Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, Roth accounts could be beneficial.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Strategically**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains, such as stocks. Employ tax-efficient investing strategies, like holding stocks for longer than a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalancing and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Liquid Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as they provide easier access without penalties.

8. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to minimize risk.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that's right for your personal circumstances.
