Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here is a general strategy for allocating funds among these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (contributions made with after-tax dollars, tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax implications when investing. For example, place high-growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) where they can grow tax-free, while keeping income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where they may incur taxation at ordinary income rates.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to all three accounts if possible. Automating your contributions can help in maintaining a disciplined savings approach.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Periodically review your investment allocation and rebalance to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your unique situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice and help create a systematic plan.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
