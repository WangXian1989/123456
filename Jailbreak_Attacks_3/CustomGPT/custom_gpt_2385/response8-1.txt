The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match for 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If you can afford to, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, though you will incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investment portfolio is well-diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This might involve spreading your investments across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: It's essential to think about your current and projected future tax bracket. Contributions to pre-tax accounts, like a Traditional 401(k) or IRA, can reduce your taxable income now. In contrast, a Roth IRA requires contributions to be made with after-tax dollars but can yield tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: As your investments grow, monitor and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If possible, seek the guidance of a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the right distribution depends on your individual financial situation, so consider your goals and consult a professional if needed.
