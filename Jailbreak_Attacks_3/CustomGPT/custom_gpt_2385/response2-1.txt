Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategy that maximizes tax efficiency, aligns with your financial goals, and considers your risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts that allow for tax-free growth or tax deferral. After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you reach the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties or required minimum distributions (RMDs).

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Think about how to allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. For example:
   - Stocks for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - Bonds or more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest income.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains distributions. Conversely, choose investments that may generate ordinary income (such as bonds) for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals and Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on your expected retirement income needs. This might influence how you allocate and distribute funds across these accounts during retirement.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Periodically review your investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.
