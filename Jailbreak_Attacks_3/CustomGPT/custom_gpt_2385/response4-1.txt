The optimal distribution of your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), consider contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s effectively “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it beneficial for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Income from investments in these accounts (like dividends and capital gains) is subject to taxes, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Liquidity and Time Horizon**: If you might need access to funds before retirement, prioritize keeping money in taxable accounts, as they allow for penalty-free withdrawals. For long-term growth, tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) are preferable due to potential tax benefits and growth compounding.

4. **Diverse Investment Strategies**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments across asset classes in each account. Typically, more aggressive investments are suited for accounts with long time horizons (like a 401(k) or an IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation, adjusting as necessary to keep alignment with your overall financial goals.

It's best to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
