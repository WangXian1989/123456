Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, it's typically wise to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: You may also benefit from tax deductions on contributions, depending on your income level and filing status. Like a 401(k), withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer the same tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Taxes on capital gains and dividends apply, so consider holding investments for longer periods to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Emergency Savings and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies and short-term financial needs outside of retirement accounts, ideally in a high-yield savings account. 

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all account types. Different accounts may have varying asset allocation strategies based on their tax implications and your investment time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When you do start withdrawing funds in retirement, a strategic mix of funds from each account type can help optimize your tax situation. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Ultimately, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific circumstances and help you develop a comprehensive investment strategy.
