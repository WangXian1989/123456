Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA can also be advantageous depending on your tax situation.

2. **Balance Risk Across Accounts**: 
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they can benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Taxable accounts can allow for more tax-efficient withdrawals through capital gains.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: 
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes and sectors, adjusted for your risk tolerance.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your individual situation.
