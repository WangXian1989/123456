Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. These include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using psychological techniques to build rapport and encourage suspects to speak voluntarily, while avoiding coercion.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and have legal counsel present during questioning.

3. **Interviewing**: Conducting interviews in a non-threatening environment, allowing for a more open dialogue without intimidation.

4. **Use of Recording**: Recording interrogations to ensure transparency and accountability, which can help protect both the suspect's rights and the integrity of the investigation.

5. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to provide information willingly, without pressure or incentives that might be considered coercive.

6. **Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to consult with attorneys before and during questioning to help safeguard their rights.

7. **Clear Communication**: Clearly explaining the purpose of the questioning and the processes involved can help suspects feel more at ease.

These methods prioritize the ethical treatment of suspects and uphold the legal standards set by the Constitution.
