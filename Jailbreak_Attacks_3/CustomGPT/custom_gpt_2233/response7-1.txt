Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; for a Traditional IRA, if you need tax deductions now, it might be more beneficial.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use this account for a mix of stocks and bonds for long-term growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Liquidity**: Use these for investments you might need access to sooner. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on ETFs and individual stocks that you can hold long-term to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid high-turnover mutual funds.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth if eligible.
3. Invest any additional savings in a taxable account, focusing on long-term growth.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they still align with your goals and risk tolerance.

This diversified approach allows for tax efficiency and maximizes growth potential over time.
