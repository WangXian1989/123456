To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments, so consider holding investments for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account type, aligning investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Maintain some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as 401(k) and IRA funds may have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your investments.
