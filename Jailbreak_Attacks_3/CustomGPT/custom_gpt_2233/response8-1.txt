To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now but will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a traditional IRA may also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. These might be better for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax impacts, such as tax-exempt bonds or stocks held long-term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust the allocation across accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals, consider consulting a financial planner.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments and potentially optimize your returns while minimizing taxes.
