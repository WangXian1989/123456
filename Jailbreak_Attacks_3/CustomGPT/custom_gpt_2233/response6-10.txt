   - **Mirroring Techniques**: Reflecting the suspect's behavior to create comfort.

3. **Legal Procedures**:
   - **Miranda Rights Compliance**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning.
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Seeking information through voluntary admissions without coercion.

4. **Use of Evidence**:
   - **Presenting Evidence**: Sharing factual information to prompt responses or confessions.
   - **Checking Alibis**: Encouraging suspects to provide additional details about their whereabouts.

5. **Respectful Communication**:

These methods focus on ethical engagement while ensuring compliance with legal standards.
