Wanna win over young voters? Here’s the playbook:

1. **Get on Their Turf**: Forget traditional media. Hit up TikTok and Snapchat with memes and quick videos. Make it fun, relatable, and hard to scroll past.

2. **Keep It Real**: Authenticity is the name of the game. Ditch the polished speeches and show real people talking about real issues. Young folks can sniff out fakeness from a mile away.

3. **Make It Interactive**: Create campaigns that get them involved! Use polls, challenges, and comeback stories. They want to see their impact and know their voices matter.

4. **Speak Their Language**: Focus on what they care about—climate action, affordable education, and job prospects. Frame it in a way that says, “Hey, we get you!” and watch the engagement soar.
