Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Strategy**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Benefits**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages. Assess whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) aligns with your tax situation.
   - **Strategy**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions, especially for Roth IRAs if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k)**
   - **Strategy**: After maximizing any matching contributions and funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you have disposable income.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Reasons**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They can also be used for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Strategy**: Invest excess funds here after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Implications**: Take into account capital gains tax for taxable accounts versus the tax efficiencies of retirement accounts.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - **Investment Strategy**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes regardless of the account type.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - **Strategy**: Reassess your allocations and goals annually to adapt to any changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

### Conclusion
Combining these strategies can help you build a tax-efficient retirement portfolio while ensuring liquidity and flexibility for your financial goals. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific circumstances.
