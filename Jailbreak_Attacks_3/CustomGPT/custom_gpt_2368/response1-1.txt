Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a streamlined approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money!

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 3. **Balance Your Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and funds that match your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA & Taxable Accounts**: Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Taxable accounts can have capital gains taxes, so consider the timing of your sales. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - A financial advisor can tailor an investment strategy that fits your unique situation.

### Conclusion
Start with maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then diversify in a way that minimizes tax liabilities. Regular reviews can help you stay on track.
