Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a concise strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement when you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate investments based on account type:
     - **Tax-inefficient assets** (like bonds) are best held in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest.
     - **Tax-efficient assets** (like stocks) can go in taxable accounts, where long-term capital gains are lower.

### 4. **Adjust According to Your Goals**
   - If you’re young and focused on growth, lean more on equities across all accounts.
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting towards more conservative investments (bonds, cash).

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust according to market changes and your financial situation.
