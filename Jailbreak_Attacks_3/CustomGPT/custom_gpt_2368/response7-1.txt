To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax or Roth options available.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account. Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but interest and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-income years to reduce taxable income.
   - In lower-income years, consider contributing to Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio within each account type, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 5. **Account Prioritization**
   - **First**: Contribute to the 401(k) up to the match.
   - **Second**: Max out your IRA contributions.
   - **Third**: Continue adding to your 401(k) and then contribute to taxable accounts as needed.

### 6. **Revisit Annually**
   - Review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances.

### 7. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - Plan for tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, especially in retirement.

This approach ensures you maximize tax benefits while also aligning your investments with your financial goals.
