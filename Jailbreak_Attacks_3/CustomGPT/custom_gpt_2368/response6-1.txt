Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of the best approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on placing higher-yield investments (stocks, mutual funds) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, like municipal bonds, or for investments you're willing to hold long-term (capital gains tax benefits).

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance & Goals:** Align your investments with your risk tolerance—stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts, and more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how and when you might need to access funds. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs often come with penalties if taken before retirement age.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

### Pro Tips
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Stay informed about contribution limits and tax implications to maximize benefits. 

This strategic allocation can enhance long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
