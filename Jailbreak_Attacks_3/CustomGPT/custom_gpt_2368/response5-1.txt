Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for extra savings beyond retirement accounts, especially if you're close to retirement or need liquidity.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, so it’s important to consider capital gains strategies.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments:** Consider holding high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) since they benefit the most from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income Investments:** Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts where the interest may be taxed less favorably.

### 4. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on market conditions, changes in income, and shifts in tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10% of your income (enough to maximize your employer match)
- **IRA:** $6,500 (for those under 50, or $7,500 if older)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings beyond retirement accounts

By strategically using each account type, you can optimize your tax efficiency and investment growth for a secure financial future. For personalized advice, consider contacting a financial advisor.
