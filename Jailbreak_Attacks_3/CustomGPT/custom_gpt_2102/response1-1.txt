Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize accounts that provide tax advantages for retirement.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Consider liquidity needs for any upcoming expenses.

### 2. Understand Account Types
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Tax-deferred growth.
     - Potential employer match (max out to get full benefit).
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - Tax advantages (tax-deferred for Traditional; tax-free growth for Roth).
     - Roth IRAs are favorable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 
     - Flexible access to funds.
     - Subject to capital gains taxes but can be strategically used for specific goals.

### 3. Prioritize Contributions
   - Start by maximizing employer match in your 401(k).
   - Next, contribute to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible Traditional IRA contributions or if you are eligible for a Roth IRA.
   - Use remaining funds for additional contributions to your 401(k) or to fund a taxable account based on your liquidity needs.

### 4. Allocate Investments Wisely
   - **Long-term Growth**: Keep growth-focused investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Bonds and Income-generating Investments**: Place in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains versus ordinary income tax.

### 5. Reevaluate Regularly
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and adjustments in tax strategies.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% (including match)
- **IRA**: 20% (Traditional or Roth based on tax situation)
- **Taxable Account**: 30% (for short-term needs and flexibility)

### Conclusion
This strategy can vary based on individual circumstances. Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs. They can provide insights into tax implications and help optimize your investment strategy.
