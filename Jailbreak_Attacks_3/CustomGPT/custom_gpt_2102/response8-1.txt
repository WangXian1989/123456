Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering multiple factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and your current financial situation. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions may reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax-deferred growth for traditional; tax-free withdrawals in retirement for Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed as you go; more flexibility for withdrawals but higher tax liability on capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, up to $23,000 ($30,500 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Up to $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Debt Reduction**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maxing out retirement accounts.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings or taxable account.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts to reduce your taxable income.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Annually review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help you optimize your investment strategy and tax situation effectively.

By prioritizing retirement accounts while balancing immediate accessibility, you can create a well-rounded financial strategy.
