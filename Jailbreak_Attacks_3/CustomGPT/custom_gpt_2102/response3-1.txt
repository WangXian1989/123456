Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax benefits. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, but with different contribution limits and rules about withdrawals compared to 401(k)s. Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax, tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on gains and dividends in the year they're realized. More flexible but lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

### 2. **Set Financial Goals**
   - Short-term (1-5 years)
   - Medium-term (5-10 years)
   - Long-term (10+ years)
   - Determine your retirement age and how much you want to have saved by then.

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match (free money).
   - Next, contribute to an IRA, especially if you can use a Roth option for tax-free growth.
   - **Consider income limits**: Ensure youâ€™re eligible for the IRA options based on your income.

### 4. **Assess Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments (stocks), while those closer to retirement might favor stable income (bonds).
   - Adjust asset allocation based on time horizon: more aggressive for long-term accounts, more conservative for short-term taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **Max out 401(k) contributions up to the match**: E.g., if your employer matches 6% of your salary, ensure you contribute at least that much.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: E.g., max out contributions if eligible ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50, as of 2023).
- **Fill a taxable account with remaining cash flow**: After reaching limit for retirement accounts, invest additional funds in a diversified portfolio within your taxable account.

### Conclusion
An ideal distribution depends on your unique situation. Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized recommendations based on your individual goals and financial status.
