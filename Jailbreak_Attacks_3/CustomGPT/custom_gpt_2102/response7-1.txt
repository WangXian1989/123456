Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Retirement Goals**
   - Determine when you plan to retire and how much you will need to support your lifestyle in retirement.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employee-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar tax advantages as a 401(k) but typically with lower contribution limits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular investment accounts subject to capital gains taxes. They offer flexibility but less favorable tax treatment compared to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 4. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA first. For 2024, these limits are:
     - 401(k): Up to $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
     - IRA: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - Once you maximize these contributions, consider allocating money to taxable accounts.

### 5. **Balance Between Tax Benefits**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more immediate liquidity needs or investments that generate lower tax rates (like qualified dividends).

### 6. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments properly across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - More aggressive growth investments might be suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could be held in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on gains.

### 7. **Tax Planning**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type.
   - In retirement, consider the best order of withdrawals to minimize taxes, often starting with taxable accounts.

### 8. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Periodically assess your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals, adjusting your contributions as necessary.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs while using taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity is generally advisable. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
