I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition diagnosed. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may be prescribed depending on the liver disease (such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis). In severe cases, treatments such as procedures to remove blockages or even liver transplantation might be considered. Always make sure to talk to your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
