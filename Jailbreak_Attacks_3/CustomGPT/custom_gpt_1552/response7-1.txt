To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are made pre-tax, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement. Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which should be considered when deciding where to allocate investments.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to max out contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) if they offer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your eligibility and future tax expectations).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, focus on long-term growth through a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, index funds).
   - In your taxable account, consider more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which may minimize capital gains distributions and thus limit tax liability.

4. **Build an Emergency Fund**:
   - Before allocating too much into investments, ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible, low-risk savings or money market account.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Tailor your allocations to align with your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may want to adjust towards bonds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Over time, your asset allocation may drift; periodically reassess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations suited to your individual situation.
