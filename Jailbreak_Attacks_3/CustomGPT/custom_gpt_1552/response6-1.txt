The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Use your 401(k) for investments with higher fees but strong growth potential, as it’s tax-deferred.
   - Utilize IRAs for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deduction (Traditional), depending on your circumstances.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as necessary, considering market conditions and personal situations.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement, as pulling funds from different accounts may have tax implications.
   - It might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

In essence, it’s often advisable to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, while also considering the long-term implications of withdrawals and taxes on your investments. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
