Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. Good for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for money you'll need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Create a Balanced Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, distribute assets among stocks, bonds, and cash. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or after major life events (job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure they align with your evolving goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you optimize your distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By following these tips, you can effectively manage your investments across different account types to meet your financial goals.
