Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For excess cash after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They come with tax implications, so invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like holding assets long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax).

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Investment Types**: Diversify within these accounts. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, and your age or risk tolerance.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances and goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 15-20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50-65%

This can vary based on your overall strategy.
