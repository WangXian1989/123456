To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Efficient Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on placing high-growth investments (like stocks) here since you'll defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Retirement Timing**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you think youâ€™ll be in a similar or higher bracket, consider Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Contributions Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and plan your contributions accordingly.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of these accounts before maximizing contributions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance is always a good idea.
