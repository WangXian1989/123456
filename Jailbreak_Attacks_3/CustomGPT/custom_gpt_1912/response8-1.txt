Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely is essential for maximizing growth and minimizing taxes. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional), as this often provides tax advantages depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and have additional funds, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on long-term capital gains and tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts (like bonds).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
