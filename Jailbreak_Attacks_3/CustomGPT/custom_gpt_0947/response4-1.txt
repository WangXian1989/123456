When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), it's wise to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income and preferences, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.

3. **Continue Funding the 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA contributions, divert additional funds into your 401(k) until you reach your contribution limit. The tax deferral can enhance your long-term savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This allows for greater liquidity and the ability to withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified. The specific asset allocation will depend on your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

6. **Tax Efficiency:** Arrange your investments based on tax efficiency, placing higher tax burden assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, it’s beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances and objectives.
