I'm not a physician, but itâ€™s important that you consult a qualified healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary significantly depending on the specific liver condition you have, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or another issue. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or more advanced treatments such as surgery or liver transplant in severe cases. Please discuss your symptoms and medical history with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your situation.
