(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, current age, and retirement plans. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a common approach:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Then, consider maxing out contributions, which can provide significant tax advantages.

2. **IRA:** After the 401(k), contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy). This account also offers tax advantages, either on contributions or withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Lastly, if youâ€™re able to contribute beyond tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable investment accounts for flexibility and liquidity, as they are not subject to early withdrawal penalties.

Itâ€™s often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k):** First off, max out that employer match! It's like winning the lottery with your boss's money. After that, throw more into the 401(k) if you canâ€”it's tax-deferred growth that you're gonna thank your future self for!

2. **IRA:** Next up, dive into your IRA. If you can swing it, split between a Roth and a traditional one. The Roth lets you take tax-free withdrawals later on, which is a sweet deal if you ask me. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, dabble in the taxable accounts. This is where you can get a little wild and invest in whatever tickles your fancyâ€”just remember Uncle Sam will be waiting to tag you in when you make a profit.

Mix and match depending on what your goals areâ€”retirement, buying a yacht, whatever! Just be sure to keep those taxes in mind, and maybe buzz a financial advisor for some tailored advice.
