Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, offering tax-free growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest here once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Risk and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use more liquid investments in your taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term Goals:** Place more aggressive, higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Final Thought
Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
