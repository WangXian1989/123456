Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax benefits. If you qualify, also consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and can be used without penalties, making them useful for shorter-term goals.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account type are well-balanced to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes.

5. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By focusing on these factors, you can optimize your investment distribution for your long-term financial success.
