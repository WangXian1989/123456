Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you think your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or ETFs.
   - This is also where you can invest money that you might need access to before retirement.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k)**: At least contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Max Out IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use any additional funds for a taxable account for flexibility.

### Key Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications for each type of account.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments to manage risk.

It’s always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
