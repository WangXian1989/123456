Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Growth**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by funding your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Consider IRAs**: Next, contribute to your IRA(s) to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Finish with Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investments in taxable accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes (e.g., a raise, job change, or tax law changes).

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your personal situation.

This approach should help you balance growth potential with tax efficiency!
