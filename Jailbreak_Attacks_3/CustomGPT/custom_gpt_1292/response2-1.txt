Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situations, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Retirement Accounts**: Aim to max out your contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA if possible. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (and $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like bonds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on interest income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends and capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

4. **Investment Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically good for more aggressive, growth-oriented investments since taxes are deferred.
   - **IRA**: Can be a mix, but consider using it for assets that might incur high taxes in taxable accounts (like high-yield bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for more liquid investments or those you may need access to before retirement.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how long you have until retirement and your risk tolerance. Generally, a longer time horizon allows for more risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment portfolios to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider working with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This approach will help balance growth potential with tax efficiency while preparing for your financial future.
