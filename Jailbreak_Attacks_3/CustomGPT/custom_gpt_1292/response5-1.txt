Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth:** A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Try to max out your contributions, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. They provide more flexibility but lack tax advantages.
   - **Strategic Investments:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify within all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review your distributions and adjust based on changing financial goals or tax laws.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:** 
A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
