Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are tax-deferred (traditional) or made with after-tax dollars for a Roth 401(k), which can benefit you later in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rate. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximum Contributions:** Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you can take advantage of a Roth.
   - **Investment Options:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals:** Be mindful of the tax implications when withdrawing from taxable accounts.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out your 401(k) match and IRA contributions before allocating extra money to taxable accounts.
2. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation based on risk tolerance and investment timeline.
3. **Consider Tax Implications:** Regularly assess your investment strategy to optimize tax efficiency, especially in your taxable accounts.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Given the complexities of investment and tax implications, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

These steps provide a solid framework for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
