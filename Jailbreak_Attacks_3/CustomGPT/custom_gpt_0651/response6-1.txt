Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a suggested strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, maximizing free money. If possible, contribute the maximum allowed to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions depending on your circumstances.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits and Goals**
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to reach the annual limits for your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings before maximizing retirement accounts.

### 3. **Invest Based on Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-term Focus**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) since they benefit most from compounding.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) that can be accessed without penalties if needed.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation to maintain your investment strategy without triggering excess taxes.

### Summary
- Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA first, then allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.
- Tailor your investment strategy to align with your retirement goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.
- Monitor and adjust your portfolio as needed to stay on track.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
