To distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your current vs. future tax rates.
  
3. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off before maxing out retirement contributions.

4. **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) since they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-yield or bond investments that generate ordinary income.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have accessible savings in case of emergencies before heavily investing.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Tailor contributions based on your retirement timeline. Younger investors may prefer more in equities, whereas older investors might favor safer assets.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation among accounts to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.
