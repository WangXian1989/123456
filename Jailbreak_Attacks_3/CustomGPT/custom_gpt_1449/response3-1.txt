The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**
   - Maximize employer match if available.
   - Contribute to the limit if your financial situation allows.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - Fund your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're eligible for a tax deduction with a Traditional IRA.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement may be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Allocate funds here for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### Example Distribution:
- **40% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA**
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**

### Factors to Consider:
- **Time Horizon:** Younger investors may lean more towards growth in 401(k) and IRAs, while near-retirees might want more stability in taxable accounts.
- **Tax Impact:** Evaluate the tax implications of withdrawals from each account. Tax-sensitive strategies can save money long-term.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Align your investment choices with your risk appetite.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on market changes and personal circumstances.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
