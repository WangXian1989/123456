The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by maxing out your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there’s a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends in taxable accounts are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Therefore, consider holding investments that generate long-term gains in taxable accounts.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains in your taxable account.

3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: 
   - Keep in mind that different accounts may have different investment strategies. For example, you may choose to hold more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA, where you benefit from tax-deferred growth, while keeping more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.
   
4. **Asset Location**: 
   - Place investments that are likely to generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - Keep investments with the potential for high growth (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes when sold.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund and Liquidity**: 
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies or upcoming expenses, as accessing retirement accounts can come with penalties and taxes if done early.

6. **Adjust As You Get Older**: 
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift your asset allocation to reduce risk. This may involve shifting more into bonds within your tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining equity exposure in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies.

By blending these strategies, you’ll be able to optimize the distribution of your money across these three types of accounts effectively.
