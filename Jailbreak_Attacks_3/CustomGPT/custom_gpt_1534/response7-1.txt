When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some steps and factors to keep in mind:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits:**
   - For a 401(k), the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older). Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - For IRAs, the contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not have contribution limits, but you’ll pay taxes on any capital gains, dividends, and interest they generate.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth benefits.

3. **Assess Your Immediate and Long-Term Needs:**
   - If you foresee needing access to your funds in the short term, prioritize your taxable accounts since they offer more liquidity.
   - For long-term savings, focus more on your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts are designed to grow your retirement funds with tax advantages.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and ensure your allocation matches your risk tolerance and time horizon. Tax-advantaged accounts can generally hold more aggressive investments as they are less exposed to short-term market volatility.
   
5. **Continuous Evaluation:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're uncertain about the best distribution strategy, consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual circumstances, including your income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment objectives.
