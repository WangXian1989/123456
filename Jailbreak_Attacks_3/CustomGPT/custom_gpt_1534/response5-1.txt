(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, you might want to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, as they offer tax benefits. Here are some considerations:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider fully funding your IRA, whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, as these accounts also offer tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for flexibility in investment choices.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your situation.

2. **IRA**: Next, smash some bucks into your IRA. If youâ€™re young, think about a Roth IRA. Tax-free withdrawals, baby! If itâ€™s a Traditional IRA, you can save some tax dough now.
