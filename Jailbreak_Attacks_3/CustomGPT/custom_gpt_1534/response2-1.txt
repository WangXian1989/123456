Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if youâ€™re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those over 50).

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, consider diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility, so you can also invest in individual stocks or ETFs.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Investment growth in your 401(k) and IRA is tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA), whereas capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed. This can influence how much you allocate to each type of account.

5. **Emergency Savings:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account (high-yield savings or similar) before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:**
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, such as buying a home, contributing more to taxable accounts may be prudent for easier access to funds.

7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances is usually a good idea.
