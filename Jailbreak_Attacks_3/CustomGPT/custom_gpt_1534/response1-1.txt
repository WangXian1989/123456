The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which can significantly benefit your long-term savings.

   - **401(k):** If you have access to a 401(k), contribute to this account, especially to get the employer match. If you're over 50, take advantage of catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.
   - **Roth 401(k):** If available, this can be a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged options, you can start funding taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility but will be subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

4. **Consider Asset Location:** Think about the types of investments you place in each account. For instance, it may be beneficial to hold stocks (which may have higher growth potential) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping bonds (which generate regular income and are taxed at a higher rate) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:** Monitor your investments and make adjustments as needed. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given that everyone's situation is unique, it could be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific needs and circumstances.

Ultimately, itâ€™s about balancing your contributions to optimize for growth, tax efficiency, and access to funds when you need them.
