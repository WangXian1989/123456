The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Take full advantage of any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions if you qualify, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, beneficial if you expect higher taxes later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for short-term goals; be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust the distribution of investments to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term investments, allowing your money to grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those with shorter time frames.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your overall financial picture and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
