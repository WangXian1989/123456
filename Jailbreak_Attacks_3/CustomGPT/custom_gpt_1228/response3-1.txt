To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributions to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with contributions potentially tax-deductible. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize employer match in your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full match.
   - **Max out IRA contributions**: If you qualify, contribute the maximum to your IRA.
   - **Contribute any remaining funds to your taxable accounts**.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds) or that you might need to access before retirement.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk:**
   - Ensure a balanced investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk appropriately.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement: consider tax implications of withdrawals from each account type.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary annually (up to the match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

By strategically distributing your funds this way, you can optimize tax benefits and prepare for a sustainable financial future.
