Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match first.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds to diversify.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial. A Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Max Contributions**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Order of Priorities
1. Max out the 401(k) enough for the match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Continue contributing to the 401(k) up to the limit.
4. Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings.

### Considerations
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing goals.
- **Evaluate Fees**: Be aware of any fees associated with your accounts and investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
