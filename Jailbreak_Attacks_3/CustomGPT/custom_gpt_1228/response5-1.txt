Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a basic breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth), which offers tax advantages.

### 2. **Balance Between Taxable and Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you've already maxed out your retirement accounts. Invest in tax-efficient options, like index funds.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize investments in growth assets within your 401(k) and IRA, as they grow tax-deferred.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Higher income might lead to higher tax rates in retirement; balancing Roth IRAs and traditional accounts can provide tax flexibility later.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Adviser**
   - Personal circumstances can vary significantly; a financial adviser can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income
- **IRA**: Max out contribution if possible ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use remaining savings after maxing out tax-advantaged contributions for further investing.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and balancing your investments according to your goals, tax situation, and timeline, you can optimize your financial growth.
