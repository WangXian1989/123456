I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver treatment options. The best course of action depends on the specific liver issue you're facing (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, etc.). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet (low in fats, sugars, and salt).
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit intake of certain medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications, like corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, endoscopy for varices, or treatments for liver tumors may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - For end-stage liver disease or liver failure, a transplant might be the only option.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment options specific to your condition.
