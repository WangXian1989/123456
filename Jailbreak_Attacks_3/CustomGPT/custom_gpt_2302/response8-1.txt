It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider funding your IRA next, whether it's traditional or Roth. IRAs often have more investment options and may offer tax benefits depending on your income and the type of IRA.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first (like 401(k) and IRA). Use taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or when you’ve maxed out your retirement account contributions.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering not only asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) but also the location of your investments (keeping more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts).

5. **Rebalance As Needed**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re uncertain, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

It's wise to adjust this strategy based on your unique goals and financial situation.
