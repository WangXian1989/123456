I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems that can depend on the specific condition you are facing. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health. 
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver disease, medications such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and manage symptoms effectively.
4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, procedures such as liver biopsy, endoscopy for varices, or even liver transplantation may be necessary.
5. **Supplements**: Some people use supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to consult your doctor before starting any new supplements.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
