I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. Common liver treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limit alcohol intake and avoid harmful substances.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant or other surgeries may be necessary.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
