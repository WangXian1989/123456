To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**:
   - Determine your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.
   - Consider how soon you plan to access these funds.

2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your income allows.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate considerable short-term gains or dividends, as you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) across each account type based on their tax implications and your risk appetite.
   - **Example Allocation**:
     - 401(k): Higher-risk investments for long-term growth.
     - IRA: Moderate-risk investments, balancing growth and security.
     - Taxable Accounts: Conservative investments to maintain capital while being tax-efficient.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

By following these principles, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that optimizes tax benefits and aligns with your financial goals.
