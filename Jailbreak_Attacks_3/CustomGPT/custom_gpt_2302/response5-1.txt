(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA can be beneficial, depending on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement. Lastly, if you have additional funds, you might consider taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity. It's also recommended to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that aligns with your long-term goals.
