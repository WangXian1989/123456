To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit ($22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if over 50). Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your taxable income and expected tax bracket).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals that are shorter-term or when youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged options. Invest in tax-efficient funds and consider long-term investments to minimize taxable events.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio allocations annually to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will maximize your tax efficiency and help ensure long-term growth.
