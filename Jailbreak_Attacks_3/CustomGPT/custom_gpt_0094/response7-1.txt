Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with shorter time horizons or for investments you may want to access before retirement age without penalties. They allow for more flexibility and can provide liquidity.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Allocate investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, more volatile investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns over time.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Summary
Start with employer matches in your 401(k), max out your IRA based on your eligibility, and use taxable accounts for short-term needs and flexibility. Adjust your investment strategy based on tax efficiency and personal risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
