Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer match first. It's tax-deferred, which is advantageous.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on higher-risk, higher-reward investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in 401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep more liquid, lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Minimize Taxes on Withdrawals**: Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Remember, 401(k) and traditional IRA have RMDs after age 73, affecting your withdrawal strategy.

### 4. **Contributions**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRAs each year, especially if you receive matching contributions.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your asset allocation is consistent across all accounts to avoid overexposure to certain assets.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often works best: maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, allocate taxable funds thoughtfully, and adjust based on your retirement timeline and tax circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
