Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (increased for inflation) for individuals under 50.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. For 2024, the limit is $6,500, with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50.
   - Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or investments that may generate significant capital gains, especially if you have already maximized tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are generally taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer-term investments benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax law, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can also be beneficial.
