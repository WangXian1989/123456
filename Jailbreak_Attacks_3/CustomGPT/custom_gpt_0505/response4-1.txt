Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions lower your taxable income. Consider investing in a mix of index funds, target-date funds, or diversified mutual funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you anticipate a higher bracket, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Know your limits and prioritize funding this account to take advantage of tax benefits while adhering to the annual limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or emergencies. Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### Strategy

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings outside these accounts for emergencies.
2. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before aggressive investing.
3. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all types of accounts.
4. **Regular Review**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan to your specific needs.
