Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Both allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, usually in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect higher future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) that generate minimal taxable events.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are better suited for accounts where long-term growth is prioritized (like 401(k)s and IRAs), while bonds may be better in taxable accounts due to their interest income taxation.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your contributions and investment allocation. Adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life events.

### 5. **Consider Legacy and Estate Planning**
   - Depending on your estate planning goals, you may want to consider how each account will be treated by heirs, especially taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach would involve prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the match, maximizing IRA contributions, and then funding taxable accounts if you have additional cash flow. Each component plays a role in a holistic financial strategy, so regular reviews with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance.
