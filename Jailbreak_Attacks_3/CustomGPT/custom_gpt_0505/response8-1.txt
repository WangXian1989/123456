Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps and considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Usually offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These have no tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawal and investing.

### 2. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, choosing between a Traditional or Roth based on your expected tax situation in retirement.

### 3. **Determine Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might prefer stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may lean towards bonds for stability.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains taxes or those that generate qualified dividends.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review your investments periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals. Adjust as needed based on market performance.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider tax implications for withdrawals in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to either Traditional or Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax efficiency.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to investing your money across different accounts, maximizing growth and tax efficiency.
