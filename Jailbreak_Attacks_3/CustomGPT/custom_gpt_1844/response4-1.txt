Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Balancing Risk and Liquidity**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If you need flexibility or may need to access funds before retirement, consider maintaining a portion of your investments here. Keep in mind that investment returns in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio. This can help manage risk and enhance returns.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, or market conditions to ensure alignment with your overall investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and investment choices, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically for your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and optimizes your tax situation.
