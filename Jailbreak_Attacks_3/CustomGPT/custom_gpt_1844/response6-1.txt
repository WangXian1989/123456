Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to optimizing your distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s free money!
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts as these usually allow for higher growth potential without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for liquidity, as these can be accessed more easily without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold assets that are expected to grow significantly in these accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Dividends and Interest in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that yield dividends or interest in taxable accounts, where you can potentially benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Rebalancing Strategy**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Up to employer match, then balance between IRA and taxable accounts.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (if eligible), focusing on growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** After tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, allocate excess funds based on cash needs and investment goals.

### Final Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances vary widely—professional advice can provide tailored strategies.
- **Stay Informed:** Regularly update your approach based on tax law changes and your financial situation.

This structured approach should help you make informed decisions regarding your investment distribution.
