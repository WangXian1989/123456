Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose a diversified mix of assets based on your risk tolerance. Many 401(k) plans offer target-date funds or index funds for simplicity.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Consider Tax Implications:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may be better if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Annual Contribution Limit:** Contribute the maximum allowed if possible. This limit can change, so stay updated.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use them for short- to mid-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy:
- Prioritize the 401(k) for employer matching.
- Consider maxing out the IRA contributions.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

### Ongoing Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and investment goals. A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
