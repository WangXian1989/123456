When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Account Prioritization:**
   - **401(k):** Preferable if it has a match; it offers tax deferral.
   - **IRA:** Choose traditional for immediate tax deductions or Roth for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility in accessing funds before retirement age.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.
   - Reserve retirement-focused investing (like low-cost index funds) for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 5. **Take Tax Implications into Account:**
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax in taxable accounts and the benefits of tax-loss harvesting.

This strategy should align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice!
