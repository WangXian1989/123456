(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general guidelines: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Tax Considerations**: Since 401(k)s and IRAs offer tax advantages (tax-deferred growth in traditional accounts and tax-free growth in Roth accounts), prioritize contributing to these before fully funding a taxable account. 

3. **Check Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) if you're under 50 and $6,500 to an IRA, with additional catch-up contributions for those over 50.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that fits your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawals and Future Tax Implications**: Consider your withdrawal strategy and the tax implications of each account type when planning for retirement. 

Consulting with a financial advisor is also beneficial for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) So you're ready to tackle your money game, huh? Hereâ€™s the deal: when it comes to distributing your cash, you want to think of it like a treasure map, but with way more boring details. 

1. **401(k) First**: Stick your gold in your 401(k) up to the match! Thatâ€™s basically free loot. After that, letâ€™s talk about the IRA. That's where you park the rest of your coins for those sweet tax breaksâ€”either now, which is what a traditional IRA gives you, or later, if youâ€™re into a Roth IRA.

2. **Taxable Accounts**: Sure, throw some cash into taxable accounts, but make sure you've maxed out those sweet 401(k) and IRA spots. You don't want Uncle Sam peeking over your shoulder for taxes when you can tax-shield like a pro.

3. **Keep an Eye on the Limits**: Donâ€™t go overboard, though! Set your limits right! Otherwise, BAM!â€”youâ€™re hit with penalties and nobody wants that. 

4. **Be a Smart Investor**: And remember, mix it up with your investments. Diversification ain't just a fancy word; itâ€™s how we avoid putting all our eggs in one basketâ€”especially when they might break!

Grab a financial ninja or advisor if you can, to tailor this treasure hunt to your needs! Good luck, money maestro!
