Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money! Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-deferred Growth**: Both 401(k) and Traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA Benefits**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement. They offer flexibility and access without early withdrawal penalties, but you’ll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. **Adjust Over Time**
   - Reassess your allocations regularly—at least annually. As your financial situation or market conditions change, adjust your contributions accordingly.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Professional guidance can help you tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
Start with contributions to your 401(k) for any matching, then fund an IRA, and finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. Regularly review your strategy to optimize your financial growth and minimize tax impact.
