Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's effectively free money.
   - **Consider High Growth**: Focus on higher growth investments since withdrawals are usually taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions here, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you need a tax deduction now, contribute here but remember that withdrawals will be taxed.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Keep enough liquid funds for emergencies.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Municipal bonds could be an option for tax efficiency.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions as they offer tax benefits.
3. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts, balancing your risk exposure.
4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investment allocations based on changing goals and market conditions.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Tailoring this strategy to your specific situation can be complex, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always review your plan annually to ensure it aligns with your goals!
