Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to receive the full employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that you might need to access before retirement, as they offer flexibility and potentially favorable capital gains tax rates on long-term investments.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments, such as stocks, since they treat capital gains favorably.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more income-generating assets (bonds, REITs) that may incur higher taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications. Typically, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.
  
### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Events**
   - Review and adjust your strategy regularly, especially during major life changes like marriage, a new job, or retirement.

### Sample Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum if you’re eligible, prioritizing Roth if you anticipate higher future taxes.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus after maximizing your contributions.

### Final Thoughts
Always align your distribution strategy with your overall financial plan, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
