Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually tax-deferred. It's a good place for higher income earners to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, with taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals and for holding investments that generate capital gains or dividends.

3. **Investment Horizon**: If youâ€™re saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). For short-term needs, consider taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Different assets are better suited for different accounts. For instance, consider placing high-growth investments (which may trigger more taxes when sold) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help you align your investment strategy with your personal circumstances and long-term goals.

Always consider your specific financial situation and adjust the strategy as necessary.
