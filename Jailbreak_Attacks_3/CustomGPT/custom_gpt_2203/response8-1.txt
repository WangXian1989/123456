Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth and higher contribution limits.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if your income allows.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for flexibility, as there are no contribution limits and you can withdraw anytime without penalties.
   - Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Debt Considerations:**
   - Before investing heavily in these accounts, pay off high-interest debts (like credit cards).

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a high-interest savings account for emergencies.

6. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your portfolio across all accounts.
   - Align investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
