To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **High Income**: Prioritize 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions to lower your taxable income.
- **Lower Income**: A Roth IRA might be more beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- Use a mix of stocks and bonds tailored to your risk tolerance across all accounts. 
- Consider more aggressive investments in taxable accounts with a longer time horizon and placing more stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Emergency Fund Allocation
- Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in your taxable account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your financial goals.

By establishing these priorities, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
