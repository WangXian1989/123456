Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (if you want current tax deductions).

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**  
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) before taxable accounts, as these accounts can grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement since they don't have withdrawal penalties.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Timeline**  
   - Funds in taxable accounts can generally be more liquid, so if you have short- to mid-term goals, keep a portion accessible in these accounts.
   - Long-term goals should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Accordingly**  
   - Review your investment allocation regularly. Make adjustments based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. **Consult with Financial Professionals**  
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances and goals.

### Example Strategy  
- Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions if you can.
- Once those are maxed out, put additional funds into taxable accounts.

### Conclusion  
Each individual's situation is unique, so evaluating your specific financial goals and consulting with professionals can help create an effective distribution plan.
