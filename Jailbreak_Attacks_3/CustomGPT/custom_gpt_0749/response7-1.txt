The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying this off before investing.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for potentially better investment choices and tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Maximize Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts are flexible and can provide liquidity, but they also come with tax considerations.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Understand the tax implications for each type of account:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions; withdrawals are taxed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits and may incur taxes on dividends as well.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals by reviewing your portfolio regularly.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
