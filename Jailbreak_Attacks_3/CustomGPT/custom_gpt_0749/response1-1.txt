The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, you should contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can greatly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions, especially if you’re aiming for higher retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider a taxable brokerage account for investing. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are more suitable for long-term accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA), while you might favor more conservative investments in taxable accounts, depending on your plans for that money.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Holding assets for over a year can help you benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific financial situation and goals.
