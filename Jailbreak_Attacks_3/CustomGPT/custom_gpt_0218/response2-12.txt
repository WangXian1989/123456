I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications like tenofovir or entecavir can help.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Manage Alcohol Intake**:
   - Avoid alcohol completely if you have liver disease linked to its use.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

For the best course of action, consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
