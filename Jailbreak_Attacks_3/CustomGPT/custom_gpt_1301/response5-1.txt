The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing your match, consider contributing to your IRA (whether it's traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This account offers tax advantages that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) and consider paying off any high-interest debts before heavily investing.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you're still within budget, increase your contributions to your 401(k) toward the annual limit if your employer match is already maximized.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Growth and Flexibility**: Consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access to your investments. This is particularly useful if you anticipate needing money before retirement age or want to invest in assets not available through tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance and Diversify**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation among these accounts based on performance and market conditions, ensuring you remain aligned with your investment strategy and goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and ensure youâ€™re making informed decisions based on the latest laws and financial products.
