While I can't provide personalized financial advice, a common strategy for distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves considering your tax situation, contribution limits, and long-term goals. 

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity. These can also provide a means to invest in assets not available within retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment timeframe. Typically, higher-risk investments are suitable for accounts with longer time horizons like 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and consider putting higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes. 

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
