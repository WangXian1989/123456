I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for specific guidance regarding liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the underlying cause of the problem, such as medication for hepatitis, lifestyle changes (like a healthy diet and exercise), or even procedures for more severe cases. It's important to work with a doctor who can provide personalized advice based on your condition. Please seek medical attention for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
