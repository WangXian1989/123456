I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for liver problems generally should be discussed with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and engaging in regular exercise. Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor might recommend medications or other therapies. Always consult a medical expert to get a treatment plan tailored to your needs.
