I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Common treatment options depend on the specific liver issue:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function and reduce fat accumulation.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Specific medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. 

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests are vital to monitor liver health and progression of any disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some may explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but these should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare provider.

Always consult with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your particular situation.
