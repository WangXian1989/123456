The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're in a high tax bracket, consider maxing out contributions here first since it can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is crucial for short-term goals and can provide flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the tax implications of your invested assets. For example, place stocks in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, while keeping bonds in a taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about where you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix can provide flexibility and tax efficiency.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your specific situation can be very beneficial.

This approach helps ensure you’re maximizing tax benefits while also meeting your investment goals.
