(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your personal financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. A general approach could be:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Use this account for tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth may be beneficial for tax-free growth in the future.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings outside retirement accounts, especially for funds that you may need access to before retirement. Taxable accounts can hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s talk strategy with some real talk! Distributing your cash across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a bit like balancing a three-legged stool—each one serves a different purpose. 

First up, hit that **401(k)** like it’s a piñata—max out any employer match because that’s free cash tossing some serious shade. Next, dive into an **IRA**. If you’re pumped about tax-free withdrawals later, go for the Roth. Otherwise, traditional IRAs can save you some coin now. Finally, stash some bucks in **taxable accounts** for flexibility and to avoid that “I can’t withdraw until I’m 59½” panic. Just watch out for taxes on capital gains—ain’t nobody got time for that. Keep an eye on your investments and adjust as life happens.
