Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. You won’t pay taxes on contributions until withdrawal, which might be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, so consider your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you might need access to before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Retain a balanced mix across account types to manage risk and tax implications effectively.
   - Different investment strategies can be implemented based on account type—more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative in taxable accounts due to the tax implications of selling.

4. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your timeline. Longer-term goals can generally lean toward more aggressive investments (stocks), while shorter-term needs might require more conservative (bonds, cash equivalents).

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly to adjust for market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
