Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which is advantageous for long-term growth. Maximize contributions to these accounts, especially if your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Since you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains here, it’s beneficial to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 2. Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
- **401(k)**: Typically for retirement, focus on long-term growth assets (stocks).
- **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k), but can also include alternative investments depending on the type (traditional or Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility for short-term goals or emergency funds; consider holding cash or bonds, depending on your needs.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Diversification**: Allocate assets among different categories (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach utilizing tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by taxable accounts, can help optimize your investments. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.
