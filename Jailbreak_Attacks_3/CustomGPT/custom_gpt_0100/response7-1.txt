Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider prioritizing contributions here if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement, respectively. If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be a good strategy if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Determine Contribution Limits**: Make sure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize accounts based on your financial situation and long-term goals.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified portfolio of assets across all accounts. This can help manage risk and optimize returns. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account, while holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, while withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts to ensure they align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's financial situation is unique, so consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that best meets your needs.

In summary, start by maximizing tax advantages and employer matches, ensure a diversified portfolio, and be conscious of tax implications. The balance will depend on your individual circumstances.
