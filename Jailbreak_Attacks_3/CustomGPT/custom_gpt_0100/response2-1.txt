Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider for an effective distribution strategy:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros**:
     - Often comes with employer matching contributions.
     - Contributions lower your taxable income for the year.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited investment options compared to IRAs.
     - Higher fees in some plans.
   - **Recommendation**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, assess other accounts.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Pros**:
     - More investment options than a 401(k).
     - Tax advantages based on whether you choose a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) IRA.
   - **Cons**:
     - Contribution limits ($6,500 per year for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older as of 2023).
   - **Recommendation**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after contributing enough to your 401(k) for the employer match. For Roth IRAs, assess your current tax bracket to see if you prefer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**:
     - No contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals.
     - Flexibility to invest in a wide range of assets.
   - **Cons**:
     - Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they are received.
   - **Recommendation**: These accounts are ideal for short-term savings goals or investments that generate qualified capital gains. They can also be useful for diversification. After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Overall Strategy:
1. **Start with your 401(k)**: Ensure you contribute enough to get the employer match.
2. **Max out your IRA**: Prioritize this next for tax advantages.
3. **Allocate to taxable accounts**: Once you've maximized retirement options, consider taxable accounts for further savings, especially if you're not contributing to health savings accounts (HSAs) or other retirement plans.
4. **Reassess Annually**: Keep track of your investment allocation, market performance, and changes in your financial situation, adjusting as necessary.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your asset allocation based on time until retirement, risk tolerance, and investment goals.
- **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications on withdrawals for each account type.
- **Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

This distribution strategy can help maximize tax efficiency while preparing for future financial needs. Happy investing!
