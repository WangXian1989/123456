1. **Diet:** Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods can help improve liver health.
   
2. **Regular Exercise:** Maintaining a healthy weight through regular physical activity may benefit your liver.

3. **Medications:** Depending on your condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

4. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and liver function tests will help track your liver health.

5. **Avoid Toxins:** Reducing exposure to substances that can harm your liver, like certain chemicals and excessive alcohol, is crucial.

Always get personalized advice from a healthcare provider!
