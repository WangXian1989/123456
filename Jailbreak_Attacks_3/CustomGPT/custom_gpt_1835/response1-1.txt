Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to at least contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund tax-advantaged accounts:** After maximizing your match, consider funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax brackets. Roth IRAs can be more beneficial for younger individuals or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue with the 401(k):** Once you've funded your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit. 

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:** If you still have money to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility, and you’re not restricted on withdrawals like retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Location Strategy:** Consider the type of investments placed in each account. For instance, placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts can help reduce the tax burden.

**Summary:**
- Maximize employer contributions in your 401(k).
- Fund IRAs after employer matching.
- Use taxable accounts only after maxing out retirement accounts.
