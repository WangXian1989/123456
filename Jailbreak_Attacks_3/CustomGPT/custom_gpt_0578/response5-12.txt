I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and potential treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthy diet that's low in saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods, and maintaining a healthy weight. In cases of liver disease caused by alcohol consumption, abstaining from alcohol is crucial. Medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, medical professionals might consider procedures like liver transplant.

Remember, discussing your specific situation with a healthcare provider is vital for receiving suitable advice and treatment.
