Iâ€™m not a doctor, but for liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. In serious cases, more advanced treatments, like liver transplant, might be necessary. Please seek medical advice for an accurate assessment and treatment plan.
