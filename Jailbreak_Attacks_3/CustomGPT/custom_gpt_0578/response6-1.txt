Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)** contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, contribute to a **Traditional or Roth IRA**. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions depending on your income level.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Ideally, you should minimize taxable income. Consider utilizing your 401(k) and IRAs to do so. Keep higher growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, as they often turn over less frequently.

3. **Diversification and Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain a **diversified portfolio** across all accounts to help manage risk.
   - Keep an emergency fund or cash reserves in taxable accounts to ensure liquidity for unexpected expenses.

4. **Consider Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, you might choose to be more aggressive in your 401(k) and IRA investments.
   - For short-term goals (like buying a house), keep those funds in taxable accounts to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial planner or tax professional to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
