When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also tax-deferred, similar to a 401(k). Withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits set by the IRS for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for employees under 50 is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Choose an allocation that aligns with your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance. Tax-advantaged accounts may be suitable for higher-risk, longer-term investments due to their tax benefits.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw money in retirement. Consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes.

Overall, a common strategy might be to maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if there's an employer match), then focus on funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals, and finally use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment flexibility. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.
