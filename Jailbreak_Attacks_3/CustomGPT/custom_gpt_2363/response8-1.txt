To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax deferral on contributions and earnings. Often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Personal retirement account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax deferrals, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts without tax advantages. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of any employer matching.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After getting the match, consider contributing to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if eligible for its tax benefits.

### 3. **Determine Your Investment Goals:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education) to guide asset allocation.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Aggressive Growth:** Consider equities, especially in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Fixed Income:** Use taxable accounts for bonds to manage tax impact, as interest income is taxed annually.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize annual tax liability.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Revisit your allocations annually or after significant life events to ensure alignment with goals.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking professional advice for personalized strategies and tax implications based on your specific situation.

These strategies can help you build a well-structured investment portfolio that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
