To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term needs:** Focus on taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-term growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be beneficial for upfront tax deductions.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Investment Selection**
   - Use low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize fees.
   - Adjust your investment choices based on the account type (e.g., more aggressive in a 401(k) or IRA if you have a longer time before retirement).

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your allocations and performance; rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to optimize your income in retirement.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that suits your financial situation and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances is also recommended.
