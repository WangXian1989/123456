To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out (2023 limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50) if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional IRA for pre-tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and eligibility.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers a limited selection of investment options, often focused on target-date funds and index funds. Select low-cost options that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Has a wider range of investment choices. Consider using it for investments with higher potential returns, like stocks, especially if you expect to hold them long-term.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate taxes, such as bonds or high-dividend stocks, which might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, risk levels, and sectors to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Keep in mind your expected tax rate during retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts now.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your approach based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts while considering tax implications and investment options, you can optimize your savings for retirement.
