Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs give you tax deductions now.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. This provides flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments may be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments might be better in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
