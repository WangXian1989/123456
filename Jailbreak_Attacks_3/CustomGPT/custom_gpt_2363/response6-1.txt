Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches and tax benefits.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential and tax benefits.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Place less tax-efficient investments, like bonds, in taxable accounts to avoid higher tax burdens in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds. Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional accounts may incur taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax Brackets**: Be mindful of your current and projected tax brackets when deciding how much to allocate to each type of account.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

### 5. **Future Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30-50% of total savings
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-40%

### Conclusion:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your needs.
