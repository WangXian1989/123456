Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions today.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, continue funding your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once your retirement accounts are maximized. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you need flexibility.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify within each account type, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, it may make sense to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Revisit your allocations annually or with major life changes to ensure they still align with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
