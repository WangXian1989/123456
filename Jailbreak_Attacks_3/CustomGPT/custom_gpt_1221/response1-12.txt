I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult with a healthcare professional when it comes to liver issues. They can provide you with a proper diagnosis and recommend treatment options based on your specific condition. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, avoiding alcohol, and following a balanced diet are often good practices, but definitely get personalized advice from a medical expert. Take care!
