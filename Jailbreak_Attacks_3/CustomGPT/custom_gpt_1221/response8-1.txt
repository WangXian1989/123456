The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k) with potential tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income and workplace retirement plan participation.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. They are subject to capital gains tax, which can be lower than income tax rates.

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type to spread risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts before maximizing contributions, as these retirement accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits:
   - For 401(k): $22,500 for 2023 (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - For Traditional and Roth IRAs: $6,500 for 2023 (plus $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - Taxable accounts have no contribution limits.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts more time to grow.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, help you with intricate tax strategies, and plan your overall investment strategy.

By weighing these factors and adjusting your contributions according to your individual circumstances and goals, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your retirement savings.
