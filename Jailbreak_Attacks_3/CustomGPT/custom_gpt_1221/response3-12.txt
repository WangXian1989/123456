I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific condition. However, I can provide some general treatment options that are often recommended for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and reduce liver fat.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Refrain from alcohol consumption, as it can cause further damage to the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe medications to manage the disease or reduce symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver health and track the progression of the disease.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions:**
   - Conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity can affect liver health. Managing these conditions can improve overall liver function.

5. **Liver-Specific Treatments:**
   - For conditions such as hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - In severe cases of liver disease, more invasive procedures, such as liver transplant, may be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
