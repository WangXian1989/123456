Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### Understanding Each Account Type:
1. **401(k)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) aligns better with your future tax expectations.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed without penalty at any time, making these accounts more flexible for short-term needs.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for profit.

### Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute at least enough to receive the full employer match.
   - Aim for 15% or more of your salary, if possible.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - Once your 401(k) contributions are set, focus on maxing out IRA contributions to diversify your tax situation in retirement.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**:
   - After meeting 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

### Example Distribution:
- **40% to 401(k)**: Maximize employer match and tax benefits.
- **30% to IRA**: Focus on tax-advantaged growth.
- **30% to Taxable Accounts**: Maintain liquidity and flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly re-evaluate your asset allocation based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as personal circumstances can greatly influence the best approach.
