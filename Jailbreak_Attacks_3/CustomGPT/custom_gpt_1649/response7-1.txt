Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this could be beneficial.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred,** which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts** are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), and consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments can be more suitable for your 401(k) and IRA, where you donâ€™t need to tap into the funds for many years.

4. **Consider Future Withdrawals:**
   - If you expect to need money before retirement age, having some funds in a taxable account can provide liquidity without penalties.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Up to the employer match in 401(k)**
- **$6,000 in IRA (or $7,000 if age 50+)**
- **The remaining funds can be allocated to a taxable account for flexibility.**

### Regularly Review and Adjust:
Monitor the performance of your investments and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored insights based on your specific circumstances.
