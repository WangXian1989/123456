Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for investments you might need to access before retirement age. Consider holding investments with long-term capital gains in these accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Asset Location:** Place assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in retirement accounts and growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### Action Steps:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Review Investment Choices:** Ensure that the investments in your accounts align with your overall risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
- **Regular Check-ins:** Monitor and adjust your contributions annually based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts while remaining flexible with taxable investments, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
