Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributing enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and over.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, you can contribute up to $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Offers greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications:** You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### **Suggested Strategy**
1. **Max Out the 401(k) Match:** Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth for tax-free growth.
3. **Finish Maxing Out 401(k):** Once IRA contributions are maxed, divert funds back to the 401(k).
4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** Once retirement accounts are maxed, invest surplus cash here for flexibility and liquidity.

### **Considerations**
- **Tax Diversification:** Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) investments.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust your investment choices based on how much risk you’re comfortable with.
- **Retirement Timeline:** The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to be with your investments.

### **Conclusion**
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation, as individual needs can vary significantly.
