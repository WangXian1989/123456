Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Benefits:**
   - **Traditional 401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - Use these for investments that might generate higher capital gains or for funds you might need before retirement age, as they have fewer tax advantages compared to retirement accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for lower-risk investments or income-generating assets that are tax-efficient.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help you tailor a strategy based on your specific situation, including your income, expenses, and long-term goals.

By balancing contributions to each type of account strategically, you can optimize your growth potential and tax efficiency over time.
