The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, income level, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. The choice between the two depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Fund the 401(k) Up to Contribution Limits:** Aim to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit, which allows for pretax savings and tax-deferred growth.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax efficiency of your investments. Generally, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) may be more suitable for taxable accounts, while higher-yield investments might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Balancing Risk and Time Horizon:** Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors might favor more growth-oriented investments, while those approaching retirement may prioritize capital preservation.

7. **Review Regularly:** Financial situations can change, so it's important to review and adjust your allocations regularly, especially as retirement approaches or your financial goals shift.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation. They can help you navigate the complexities of tax implications and investment choices.
