When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to optimize your investment allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalty and provide more control over your investments.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Optimize your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while lower-risk investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts where interest income may be taxed at a higher rate.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired level of risk and alignment with your financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to investing your money across various accounts.
