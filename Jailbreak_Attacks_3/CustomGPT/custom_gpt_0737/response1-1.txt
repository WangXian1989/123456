Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax considerations). This can provide tax advantages and increase your retirement savings.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you can financially manage it, continue to max out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This will help reduce your taxable income as well.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, consider contributing to taxable accounts if you have additional funds. These accounts provide flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances.
