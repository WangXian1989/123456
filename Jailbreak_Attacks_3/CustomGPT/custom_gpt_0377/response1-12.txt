I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that liver problems vary a lot, and the treatment options depend on the specific condition you have, like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your situation and recommend a tailored treatment plan. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgery. Always better to get expert advice!
