To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon and risk tolerance to guide asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure diversification across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations to maintain your target investment strategy.

6. **Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute regularly to each account, adjusting based on yearly financial situations and tax benefits.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy.
