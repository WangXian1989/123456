Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) for its tax advantages. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalty and can be advantageous if investments are held long term to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is prioritized.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocations and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
