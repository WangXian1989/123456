To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Allocate Excess Funds to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, use any additional savings for taxable accounts. This allows more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Generally, high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth or income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) can be beneficial in taxable accounts due to preferential tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio at least annually based on market changes and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can personalize strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.
