When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider a few factors such as your current tax situation, your retirement goals, and your investment strategy. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure you contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you're still able to contribute more after your IRA, resume contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRA limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA and still have funds to invest, consider investing in a taxable account. This can give you more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains on taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate. 

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to mitigate risk. Consider your asset allocation across accounts and adjust as needed based on market conditions and your financial goals.
