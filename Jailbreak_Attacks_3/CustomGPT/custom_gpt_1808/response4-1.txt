When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met. Consider funding this account if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but you will owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a taxable account. This allows for easy access in case of unexpected expenses without penalty.

4. **Diversification**: Create a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Long-term Goals**: If you are saving for long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For medium-term goals, consider taxable accounts for more flexibility.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy and how to manage your tax liability by pulling funds from different accounts.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your financial situation, investment performance, and changing tax laws.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.
