The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider for an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if feasible, typically set at $20,500 for 2023 (or $27,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out an individual retirement account (IRA) next, which has a contribution limit of $6,500 for 2023 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 and older). Depending on your income, you may want to choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable account. Earnings from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider the impact of investment choices on your overall tax burden.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This means spreading your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to help mitigate risk.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Tailor your investment strategy to match your goals. For short-term goals, it’s wise to be more conservative. For long-term goals (like retirement), you can afford to take on more risk, especially if you have a longer time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time frame.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

Ultimately, the right distribution approach is highly individualized, so be sure to take your entire financial picture into account.
