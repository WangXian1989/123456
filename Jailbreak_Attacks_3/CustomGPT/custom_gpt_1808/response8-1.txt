When determining the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money you contribute until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts does not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized. Consider placing investments that generate little to no taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) here.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure that you’re maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts have annual contribution limits. The 401(k) limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Asset Location**: 
   - Certain types of investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts. For instance, higher-growth investments may benefit from tax-deferred growth in a 401(k) or IRA, while income-producing assets (like bonds) may be more tax-efficient in a taxable account.

4. **Emergency Fund and Cash Needs**: 
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account. Ideally, this should be kept outside of retirement accounts.

5. **Retirement Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Your age, retirement goals, and how far you are from retirement should guide your asset allocation. Younger investors may opt for a riskier portfolio since they have time to recover from market fluctuations.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Regardless of the accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Flexibility & Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Planning for tax-efficient withdrawals can affect how you allocate money between accounts. 

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
