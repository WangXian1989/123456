I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol and drugs.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral or specific medications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consult a nutritionist for meal planning to support liver health.

5. **Surgical Options**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
