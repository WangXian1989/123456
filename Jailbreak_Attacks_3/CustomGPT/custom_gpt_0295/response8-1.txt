Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **401(k):** After getting the match, max out your contributions to your 401(k) if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide flexibility since they aren’t subject to withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Choose tax-efficient investments for taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By strategically prioritizing contributions, you can effectively build your wealth while considering tax implications.
