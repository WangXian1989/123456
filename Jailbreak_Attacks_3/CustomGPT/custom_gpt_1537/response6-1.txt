Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or municipal bonds. Capital gains taxes can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type based on risk tolerance.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then diversify your investments across all account types while being mindful of tax implications. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
