I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health and treatment options. Best treatment options for liver problems usually depend on the specific condition, but common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Reducing sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats is also important.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and can reduce fat in the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed by your doctor.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies help monitor liver function and the progression of the disease.

5. **Vaccinations**: For certain liver conditions (like hepatitis), vaccinations can help prevent complications.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical intervention might be necessary, including liver transplant in extreme cases.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific liver condition.
