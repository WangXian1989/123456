Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for higher contributions due to payroll deductions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Beneficial for potentially lower tax rates during retirement; consider your income level for contribution deductibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you approach retirement, think about which accounts you’ll withdraw from first. Taxable accounts might be used first to allow other accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Location**
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like REITs or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations across accounts based on performance, changes in risk tolerance, or life circumstances.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial planner who can provide insights based on your unique circumstances.

By utilizing this strategy, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing your tax burden over time.
