To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. The contributions are often tax-deductible, and the growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Understand Contribution Limits**: For 401(k), ensure you contribute up to the employer match if available. For IRAs, be aware of the annual contribution limit.

2. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Needs**: Funds in taxable accounts can be more accessible without penalties, allowing for liquidity.
   - **Use Tax-Deferred Accounts for Long-Term Growth**: Keep investments that are expected to grow a lot in the 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferral.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversification Across Accounts**: Consider diversifying your investments proportionally across all accounts based on your risk tolerance; maintain location efficiency (e.g., hold bonds in tax-deferred accounts and equities in taxable accounts).
   - **Rebalance as Necessary**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation in line with your financial goals.

4. **Investment Selection**:
   - **Choose Funds Wisely**: In tax-advantaged accounts, you might want to select high-growth mutual funds or ETFs, while opting for tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Minimize Taxable Events**: Be cautious about investment strategies in taxable accounts that generate short-term capital gains or dividends, as they can increase your tax burden.

By using these strategies, you can optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term growth while strategically minimizing your tax implications.
