Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **Define Your Goals**: Consider what you are saving for (retirement, a house, education, etc.) and the timeline for these goals.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employer matches can also enhance your savings, so aim to contribute enough to get any match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: There are Traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Choose based on your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility and easy access to funds. However, you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so they can be less tax-efficient for long-term investments.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax savings.
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts in retirement could affect your tax bracket.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).

5. **Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investment performance and adjust your contributions and allocations as needed based on market conditions and any changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider seeking professional guidance to tailor a strategy that fits your needs.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
