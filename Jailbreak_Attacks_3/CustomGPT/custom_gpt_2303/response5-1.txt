(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. A general approach is to maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first. You might consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, especially, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, you may want to consider a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility but are taxed on capital gains.

Periodically review your allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

First off, if your 401(k) has an employer match, that's your golden ticket; throw as much as you can there â€“ it's like finding free money in your couch cushions! Then, think about an IRAâ€”whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth depends on if you want tax breaks now or later. Generally, a Roth can be slick for tax-free withdrawals when you're older.

Round it out by keeping an eye on your portfolio to make sure it aligns with your goals. If you're overwhelmed, don't hesitate to hit up a financial advisor who can help tailor things to your situation. Get your money working for you!
