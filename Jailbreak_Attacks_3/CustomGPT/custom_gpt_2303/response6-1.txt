When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind various factors such as your investment goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider maintaining a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Typically, a higher allocation to stocks is advised for long-term growth if you are younger.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all account types to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk level.

3. **Understand Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts might be taxed at a lower rate. This may influence which account to withdraw from first in retirement.
   - **Roth Conversions**: If eligible, consider converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, keeping in mind the tax implications of the conversion.

By using these strategies, you can help optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, enhancing both growth potential and tax efficiency over time.
