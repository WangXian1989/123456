Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can afford to do so.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility. This enables you to access funds without penalties and provides more investment choices.

### Allocation Tips
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Use more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.
- **Time Horizon**: The longer the investment horizon, the more risk you might take on in your 401(k) and IRA, while shorter-term savings might be more conservative in taxable accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden. 

Consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your situation. They can consider your complete financial picture and help design an optimal allocation strategy.
