When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your overall financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first since they offer tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match â€“ this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans, and $6,500 for IRAs, with an additional catch-up contribution allowed if you're over 50.

3. **Focus on Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA up to the limit before investing more in taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investment. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility, allowing access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to manage risk and align with your investment strategy. Consider your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation remains in line with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan to your individual needs and goals.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can effectively work toward your long-term financial objectives while optimizing your tax situation.
