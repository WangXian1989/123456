To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Prioritize contributing enough to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to obtain any matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
- **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. 

### 2. Balance Contributions Based on Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
- **IRA:** Withdrawals in retirement from a traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

### 3. Consider Liquidity Needs
- Allocate funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or goals that may arise before retirement. This ensures that you have liquid assets available without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 4. Diversify Investment Types
- Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and growth potential.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income until you max out contribution limits.
- **IRA:** 10-15% of your income into a traditional or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds after maximizing contributions to the above accounts.

### Monitor and Adjust
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, retirement goals, and market conditions to ensure you're on track for your financial objectives.

This multi-faceted approach promotes long-term growth while balancing immediate needs and tax implications. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
