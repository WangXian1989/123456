Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**: Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and future tax expectations). Traditional IRAs can provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your match and IRA contributions, continue putting money into your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit, as it offers tax advantages and often better investment options.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility, especially if you need access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust contributions as necessary based on life changes or market conditions.

It might also be wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
