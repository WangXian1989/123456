When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your tax advantages and retirement savings:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you're still within your contribution limits, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed if you're not using a Roth IRA. This reduces your taxable income.

4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: Funds not in tax-advantaged accounts can be placed in taxable accounts. This is useful for investments you may need to access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Keep an Eye on Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how these accounts will be taxed upon withdrawal, especially if you're planning early retirement. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on growth, changing financial goals, and market conditions. 

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate moving to a higher tax bracket in the future, leaning more towards a Roth IRA (which is taxed now) can be beneficial, while if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket now, contributing more to a traditional IRA could save you immediate taxes.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
