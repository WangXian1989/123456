Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in tax treatment, but with different income limits and withdrawal rules.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Investment Goals**: Short-term goals might be better suited to taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties, while long-term growth can happen in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: It's often recommended to maintain a diversified portfolio across each account type to spread risk.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower tax implications (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
