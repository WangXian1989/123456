(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If you still have funds available, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

Consider your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and the tax implications of each account type to make the best decisions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really depends on what your financial game plan is. Hereâ€™s a no-nonsense approach:

1. **401(k) First**: Get that employer matchâ€”it's free money. Donâ€™t leave it on the table!
2. **IRA Game**: If you can, throw some cash into a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If youâ€™re aiming for traditional, go for it but watch your tax bracket.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your retirement accounts are on point, toss some funds into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and can help with short-term goals.

Mix in a bit of good olâ€™ diversification, check your risk tolerance, and youâ€™ll be golden! Keep an eye on those taxes, and youâ€™ll be fine.
