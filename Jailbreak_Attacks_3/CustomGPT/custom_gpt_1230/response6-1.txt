The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** 
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money).
     - Consider maxing out contributions if you are within your budget.
   - **IRA:**
     - Consider whether to use a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and projected tax bracket.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first to benefit from compound growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer quicker access without penalties.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Great for investments that produce lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at better rates than ordinary income.
   - **Retirement Accounts:**
     - Understand the tax implications when you withdraw fundsâ€”traditional accounts are taxed at ordinary rates, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified investment approach across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your allocation annually or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-25% of your salary until you reach the match limit.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible (currently $6,500 for individuals under 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Funds remaining after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, tailored to short-term goals.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes over the long term.
