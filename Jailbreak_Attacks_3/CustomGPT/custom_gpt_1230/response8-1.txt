To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for short-term needs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age, as they allow for easier withdrawals without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - For tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding assets that generate higher returns (e.g., stocks).
   - In taxable accounts, hold more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth, tax efficiency, and future access.
