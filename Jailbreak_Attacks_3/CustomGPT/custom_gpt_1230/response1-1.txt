Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investing timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and phases-out based on income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer more flexibility and withdrawal options without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes:** Be mindful of how investments might be taxed upon selling, especially short-term vs. long-term capital gains.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Investment Growth:** Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes longer.
- **Emergency and Short-Term Needs:** Keep cash or conservative investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Rebalance Regularly:
Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market changes.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
