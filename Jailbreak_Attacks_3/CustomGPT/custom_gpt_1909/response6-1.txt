To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Utilize the tax advantages by contributing pre-tax dollars, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contribution**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - For traditional IRAs, prioritize these after maximizing your 401(k), focusing on tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investment choices that may generate capital gains or dividends, as you can manage taxes more actively.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts, adjusting for the tax implications of each account type.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax deferral.
   - Hold bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage your tax liability effectively.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax implications for a well-rounded financial approach.
