The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're eligible for a match, prioritize this up to the matching amount. Consider increasing your contributions to take full advantage of tax deferrals.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Invest in a Taxable Account**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to a taxable account. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals, as it offers more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place assets with the highest expected returns (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral. More stable assets, such as bonds, can be held in taxable accounts where taxes are more manageable.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Assess your investments regularly to ensure they are aligned with your risk tolerance and goals. Adjust the allocation as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, especially if you have complex financial situations, consider talking to a financial advisor.

Remember, the right distribution will differ based on individual circumstances, so taking specific financial aspects into account is key.
