The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford to contribute more, consider maxing out your contributions if it aligns with your financial goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, which can lower your taxable income, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexible access to your money. This can also be beneficial for short-term goals or investing in assets that benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and allocate less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively traded funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Planner**: If uncertain, consult a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.

Tailoring these strategies to your situation will help maximize your retirement savings and minimize tax liabilities.
