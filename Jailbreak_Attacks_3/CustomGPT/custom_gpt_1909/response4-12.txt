I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition affecting the liver. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. Always seek personalized medical advice from a qualified provider.
