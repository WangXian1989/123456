When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on any profits made from selling investments.

2. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well (traditional or Roth based on your tax strategy).

3. **Emergency Fund First**: 
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Use your taxable accounts for more flexible investments (stocks, ETFs), while holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider asset location strategies, placing higher growth (and potentially more tax-heavy) assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments in their 401(k) and IRAs since they have time to recover from market downturns.
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting to more stable, income-generating investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If youâ€™re unsure about the best asset allocation or tax strategies, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your financial situation.

Ultimately, your distribution will depend on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and overall tax strategy. Adjusting your approach as you near retirement or as your financial situation changes is important for optimizing your investments.
