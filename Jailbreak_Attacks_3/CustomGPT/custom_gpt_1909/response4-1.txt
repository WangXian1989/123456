It's essential to consider several factors when deciding how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will also be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest income in the year they are realized.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you are aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maxing out contributions to a 401(k) and IRA can be advantageous.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you are investing for retirement (30+ years away), you may prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account may be more suitable.

4. **Employer Matching**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are well-diversified across all accounts. Avoid over-concentration in one type of asset or account.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Depending on your expected tax bracket in retirement, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

A potential strategy could be:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Max out contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
3. Then, continue contributing to your 401(k) and traditional IRA as desired, while also keeping funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
