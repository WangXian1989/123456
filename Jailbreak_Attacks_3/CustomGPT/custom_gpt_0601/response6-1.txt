Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement, as they don't have early withdrawal penalties. Investments here may be subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA Withdrawals:** Understand that these accounts generally have tax deferred growth, but withdrawals are taxable at your ordinary income rate in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **High-Growth Investments:** Consider placing these in your taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Bonds or Income-Generating Assets:** These might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to higher tax rates on ordinary income.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Assess how much liquidity you might need in the short term. Maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account for easier access without penalties.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts and consider more aggressive strategies in taxable accounts for long-term growth.

### Summary
- Start with maxing out employer contributions to your 401(k).
- Utilize tax-advantaged accounts effectively based on your age and income needs.
- Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types to balance risk and growth potential.
