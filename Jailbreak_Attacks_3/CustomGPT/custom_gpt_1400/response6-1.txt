Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Determine if you need access to funds sooner (taxable accounts) or if you're saving for retirement (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Factor in your comfort level with market risk.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and future income expectations. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as this can enhance tax efficiency.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds that align with your risk tolerance. Target-date funds can simplify this.
   - **IRA**: Consider a broader array of investments, including ETFs and individual stocks, for potential higher returns.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Monitor your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor a distribution strategy specific to your personal circumstances and help you navigate complex tax implications.

### Final Thoughts
- Start with employer-sponsored plans for maximum matches.
- Balance the tax benefits with the flexibility of taxable accounts.
- Keep an eye on investment performance and tax implications regularly.

Consider your specific financial situation when deciding on the distribution.
