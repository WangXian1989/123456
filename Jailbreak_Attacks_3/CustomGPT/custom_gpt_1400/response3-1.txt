Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for savings beyond your retirement accounts or if you need more flexibility.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, so withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so be mindful of your investments here.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) for long-term growth since these accounts are intended for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** It may be beneficial to hold less tax-efficient investments here, such as bonds or specific funds, to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Consider Time Horizon**
   - Younger individuals might focus on aggressive growth in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your allocations and contributions periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals, changing circumstances, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Direct any additional savings to your taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution is one that aligns with your personal financial situation, goals, and investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice for your circumstances.
