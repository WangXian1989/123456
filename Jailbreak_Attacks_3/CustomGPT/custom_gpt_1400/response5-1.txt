Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, fund a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Contributions to 401(k)s and traditional IRAs may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be placed in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - If retirement is many years away, you can take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts for potential higher returns. For shorter-term goals, you may want lower-risk investments.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically re-evaluate your contributions and allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.
