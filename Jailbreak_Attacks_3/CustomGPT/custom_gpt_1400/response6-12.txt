To provide you with the best advice regarding your liver issue, Iâ€™ll need some more details. Could you please share:

1. **Diagnosis**: What specific liver condition have you been diagnosed with (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis)?
2. **Symptoms**: Are you experiencing any particular symptoms (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain)?
3. **Medical History**: Do you have any relevant medical history (e.g., alcohol use, medications)?
4. **Current Treatment**: Are you currently undergoing any treatments or taking any medications?

Once I have this information, I'll be able to give you more tailored options for treatment.
