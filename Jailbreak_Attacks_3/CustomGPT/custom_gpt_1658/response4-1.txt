Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends largely on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a suggested approach you can take:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) after you secure any employer match on your 401(k). IRAs can often have more investment options than 401(k)s.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement. Great for reducing taxable income now but consider your potential future tax bracket when withdrawing.
   - **IRA:** If you have a traditional IRA, it's similar to a 401(k) for tax purposes. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** While not tax-advantaged, they offer flexibility. Gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which may be lower than your income tax rate. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you want more investment flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Diversity**
   - **401(k):** Choose a diversified mix of core investments such as index funds or target-date funds.  
   - **IRA:** Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, or other assets based on your risk tolerance, and utilize options that might not be available in your 401(k), such as real estate or international investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as ETFs or tax-managed funds. Be mindful of trades as they can trigger capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your desired risk level, especially as you get closer to retirement or your financial goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from your retirement accounts prematurely, which can incur penalties and tax consequences.

### Actionable Checklist:
1. **Review your employer’s 401(k) match policy.**
2. **Determine how much you can contribute to your IRA.**
3. **Establish your investment strategy based on your goals.**
4. **Consider using tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts.**
5. **Set a reminder to review and rebalance your portfolio at least once a year.**
