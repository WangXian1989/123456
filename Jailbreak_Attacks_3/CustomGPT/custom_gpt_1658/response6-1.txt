Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to guide your distribution:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, tax-advantaged but with contribution limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts without tax advantages but more flexibility.

### 2. Factor in Contribution Limits

- Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
  - **401(k)**: $20,500 (or $27,000 if age 50+ for 2023)
  - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+ for 2023)

### 3. Prioritize Contributions

- **Maximize the Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially “free money.”
- **Contribute to IRAs**: If you are eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next for additional tax advantages.
- **Fill Up Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investments once 401(k) and IRA are optimized.

### 4. Consider Tax Implications

- 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax (or tax-deductible) but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
- Capital gains taxes apply to investments in taxable accounts, so be strategic about selling to minimize taxes.

### 5. Diversify Your Investments

- Within each account, diversify your investment choices (stocks, bonds, ETFs) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Actionable Checklist:

- **Evaluate contributions**:
  - [ ] Check current contributions to your 401(k).
  - [ ] Ensure you are getting the full employer match.
- **Max out IRA**:
  - [ ] Open an IRA if you don't have one.
  - [ ] Set up automatic contributions.
- **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**:
  - [ ] Assess investment options in taxable accounts.
  - [ ] Review tax implications of investments.
- **Regular Review**:
  - [ ] Schedule quarterly reviews of your investment strategy.

By following these steps, you can optimize your contributions across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for balanced growth and tax efficiency.
