I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. General treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol or substances harmful to the liver.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests and staying in touch with healthcare providers for ongoing assessments.
4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: If the liver problem is due to another condition, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, treating that condition can help improve liver health.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where liver function is significantly impaired, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
