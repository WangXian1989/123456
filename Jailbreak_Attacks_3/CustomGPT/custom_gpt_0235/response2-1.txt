When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the tax implications, contribution limits, and your individual financial goals. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, this can be beneficial.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can be an excellent option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, but taxed at withdrawal.
   - **Consider Income Limits**: Ensure you're aware of income limits for Roth contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Post-Tax Growth**: Fund taxable accounts after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts provide flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - **Invest for the Long Term**: Focus on investments that have favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified to manage risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on your goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

This strategy can vary widely based on personal circumstances, such as income level, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial.
