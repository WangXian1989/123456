(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as a 401(k) and IRA. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. If you can, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and future tax expectations. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. Here, consider investing in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer is matching, you better snatch that up like it's the last slice of pizza at a party. Go for the max contribution if you can, because thatâ€™s tax-deferred cash, and who doesnâ€™t love lowering their taxable income?

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Next, slam some cash into an IRA. If you want tax-free growth for retirement, go Roth. If you want tax breaks now, traditional is your buddy. Either way, try to max that bad boy out. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve stuffed your retirement accounts, throw some money into taxable accounts. Go for low-cost index funds or ETFs to avoid getting slapped with heavy taxes when you sell. It's like playing chess; just be strategic about those capital gains. 

Ultimately, figure out your financial goals, and donâ€™t shy away from chatting with a financial advisor to nail down a personalized game plan. You've got this! ðŸ¤‘
