To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Check your employer's plan for contribution limits, which are typically higher than IRAs.
   - **IRA**: Know the contribution limits for both Traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits here, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your employer's 401(k)**: Especially if there's a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial for your tax situation.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Use 401(k) and IRA for tax-deferred growth**: These accounts allow your investments to grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**: Money can be withdrawn at any time without penalties (though taxes on gains may apply).

4. **Balance Risk Across Accounts**:
   - **Hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts**: Since these accounts are shielded from taxes, it can be beneficial to have stocks or high-growth assets here.
   - **Use more conservative investments in taxable accounts**: This can help mitigate tax implications from capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust the allocation across accounts to ensure your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial planner.

Consider these elements for your distribution strategy to optimize your retirement savings.
