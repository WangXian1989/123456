Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. Here are some effective approaches:

1. **Building Rapport**:
   - Establishing a connection with the suspect can create a conducive environment for open communication.
   - Officers can use active listening and empathy to make the suspect feel heard and understood.

2. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - This technique involves encouraging the suspect to recount their experiences in detail, which can lead to them inadvertently revealing information.
   - Officers can ask open-ended questions to facilitate a thorough narrative.

These methods focus on collaboration and respect for individual rights, promoting a sense of safety and cooperation during the questioning process.
