To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often has employer match; contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Ideal for initial savings.
- **IRA**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals and different investment options; capital gains taxes apply to earnings.

### 2. Allocate Funds Strategically
- **Max out Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
- **Tax Efficiency**:
  - Place assets with higher growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
  - Maintain low-turnover and tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax exposure.
- **Diversify Contributions**: To balance your portfolio:
  - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts.
  - Adjust contributions based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 3. Regular Rebalancing
- Review and rebalance your asset allocation regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
