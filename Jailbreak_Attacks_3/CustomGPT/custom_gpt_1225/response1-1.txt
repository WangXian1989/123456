To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pretax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. Focus on putting enough into your 401(k) to maximize the employer match and then consider your other options.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maxing out your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great long-term investment, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you have excess funds after your 401(k) contributions and if youâ€™re eligible based on income limits, contribute to a Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, put any additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, but you will be subject to capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth-focused assets (e.g., stocks) might be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts due to tax-deferred growth. More conservative investments may be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts regularly for performance and make adjustments as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
