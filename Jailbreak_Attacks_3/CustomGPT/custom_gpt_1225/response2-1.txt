The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) next, especially if it offers pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income. Consider the limits and how much you can afford to contribute.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible for contributions, max out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Balance Contributions**: Once you've taken full advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) and contributed to your IRA, consider balancing additional contributions based on your needs:
   - If you're saving for a short-term goal or need flexibility, think about your taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about when and how you’ll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility, but you’ll need to pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Tax-advantaged accounts have penalties for early withdrawal, but the growth is typically tax-deferred or tax-free.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are diversified. If your 401(k) has limited fund options, bridge that gap in your IRA and taxable accounts with a wide range of investment types (stocks, bonds, index funds, etc.).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as needed, especially as your financial situation changes, or as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This general framework can help you strategically distribute your investments while maximizing growth and minimizing taxes.
