Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that maximizes tax efficiency and aligns with your financial goals. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high employer match, prioritize this to secure those benefits first.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits but taxes are due on withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Aim to fill up tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first before moving excess funds to taxable accounts.
   - Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Tax-Efficient Investments for Taxable Accounts**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Avoid high-turnover funds that can incur higher taxes.

5. **Consider Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan for which accounts to withdraw from in retirement. Generally, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Each individual's situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice considering your circumstances, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient approach to your investments.
