Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often comes with a match. Contributions reduce current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional & Roth)**: Tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Account**: No tax advantages, but flexible for withdrawals. Capital gains and income taxes are applicable.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth is typically favored if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Fill 401(k) contributions**: After maximizing the above, contribute up to the annual limit in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable accounts**: Any additional savings can go here for more flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Long-term investments**: Prefer holding investments that produce capital gains in taxable accounts since they are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Hold bonds or high-dividend stocks**: These should typically be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing goals. Ensure your risk tolerance remains aligned with your investment strategy.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal circumstances vary, so getting tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation.

This strategy can help you maximize growth while managing tax efficiency across your accounts.
