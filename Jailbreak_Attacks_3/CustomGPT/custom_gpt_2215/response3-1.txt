Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some tips to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Best for those in higher tax brackets who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Favorable if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexible access to funds, but consider the tax implications of capital gains.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Equities vs. Bonds**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments or bonds to manage capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across accounts while maintaining a cohesive overall strategy.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when to withdraw from different accounts in retirement to optimize taxes. 

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on market changes and shifting financial goals.
