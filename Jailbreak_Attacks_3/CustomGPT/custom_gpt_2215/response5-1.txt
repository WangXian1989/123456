Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors like tax implications, investment goals, and financial timeline. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to start.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - **Consider an IRA**: If you're eligible, max out contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Contribute to 401(k) Up to Limit**
   - **Beyond the Match**: After maxing out the employer match and your IRA, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have money to invest after maxing out above accounts, taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for short- to mid-term goals. They can be beneficial for capital gains tax rates.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxation on Withdrawals**: Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts prioritize tax-free growth.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**
   - **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions where you receive benefits (like employer matches) and utilize tax-advantaged accounts effectively before considering a taxable account. Regularly reassess your strategy to align with your evolving financial situation.
