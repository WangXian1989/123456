Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often comes with employer matching and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes but offer flexibility in withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Prioritize long-term investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to avoid taxes on gains until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more accessible investments or those expected to hit higher tax brackets.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Consider a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that minimize taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often involves maximizing the benefits of employer-backed plans, utilizing tax-advantaged accounts effectively, and being strategic about taxable investments. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
