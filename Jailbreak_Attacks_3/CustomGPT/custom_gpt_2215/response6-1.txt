Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are less tax-efficient but offer flexibility. Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in these accounts due to their tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Revisit Regularly**
   - **Adjust Contributions:** Monitor your investment performance and tax situation annually to make necessary adjustments.

### 5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - A personalized strategy considering your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation can provide optimal results.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and carefully considering your investment choices, you can effectively manage your financial portfolio.
