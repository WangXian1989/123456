Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), reducing your taxable income or allowing tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Max Out IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for short-term needs or emergencies.
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate, or for long-term growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - **Adjust as Needed**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
