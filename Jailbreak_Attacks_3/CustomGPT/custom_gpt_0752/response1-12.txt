I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, medications may help manage symptoms and reduce inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures to remove damaged tissue or even a liver transplant might be warranted.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people find herbal supplements or acupuncture beneficial, but it's important to consult a doctor before trying these.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a tailored approach to treatment.
