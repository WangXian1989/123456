To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this if you have high contribution limits and employer matching. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth can be beneficial.

3. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across these accounts. Younger investors might lean more toward equities for growth, while those closer to retirement might want more bonds for stability.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield preferential tax treatment, like long-term capital gains on stocks. Minimize taxable income by investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments that may yield significant capital gains or interest in tax-deferred accounts to delay taxes.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside, typically in a savings account, to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation for personalized strategies and insights.

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency, aligning with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
