Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: After capturing the full employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, choose between traditional (tax-deductible now, taxed at withdrawal) or Roth (taxed now, tax-free at withdrawal) IRAs.
   - **Backdoor Roth IRA**: If your income exceeds the limits for direct contributions, explore the backdoor Roth IRA strategy.

### 3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, direct funds to taxable accounts. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Match your investment strategy with your time horizon. If youâ€™re many years away from retirement, focus on growth-oriented assets. As you near retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Utilize Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place investments with higher potential returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or life circumstances, and adjust your strategy accordingly.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor who can tailor strategies specifically to your situation and help you navigate complex tax implications.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your retirement savings while minimizing tax liability over time. Remember, personal circumstances can vary greatly, so tailor these guidelines to fit your unique financial situation.
