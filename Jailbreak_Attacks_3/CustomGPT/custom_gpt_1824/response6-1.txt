To strategically distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

### 1. Understand Account Characteristics
- **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, reducing taxable income. Employer matches can boost savings significantly.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Offers flexibility but is subject to capital gains tax on profits. Ideal for short-term goals or investments that require liquidity.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, prioritizing Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after fully utilizing tax-advantaged options, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds).

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of equity and bond funds suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **IRA**: Similar allocation strategy, but consider including higher-growth options since taxes are deferred (traditional) or managed better (Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on long-term investments to minimize taxable events. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains.

### 4. Periodic Review and Rebalance
- Regularly check portfolio balance to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance, adjusting contributions as needed.

Implementing this plan could enhance your long-term growth and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
