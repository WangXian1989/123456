When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax Advantage**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts first. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs and 401(k)s provide tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for goals that require flexibility or access to funds in the near term. Keep investments that benefit from long-term capital gains (like index funds) in these accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Ensure you keep a balanced allocation across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account any tax implications.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first before tapping into tax-advantaged accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
