Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to reach any employer match, as this is "free money." Aim to contribute up to the maximum allowable limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a traditional or Roth IRA. For a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for liquid investments or funds you may need before retirement. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes apply to these accounts, so consider investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and individual investments to manage risk effectively.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re young and far from retirement, you might prioritize aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRA, with a smaller allocation to taxable accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments, especially in your taxable accounts to reduce risk.

5. **Continuous Re-evaluation**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, helping you devise a plan that aligns with your long-term objectives.

By strategically allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax implications.
