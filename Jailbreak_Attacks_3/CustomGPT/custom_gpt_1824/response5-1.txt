I'm unable to provide financial advice. However, I can suggest general strategies for managing investment accounts that might help you make informed decisions.

For a balanced distribution:

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer match. Maximize contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, since contributions are pre-tax.
   
2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals. If you're eligible, contribute the maximum allowed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income, such as dividend-paying stocks, if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then taxable ones. Adjust based on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon.

For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.
