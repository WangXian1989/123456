Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you can either benefit from tax deductions now (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs in 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them ideal for medium- to long-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Consideration of Overall Strategy**
   - **Overall Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust asset allocation in accordance with changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
- **Holistic Approach**: Consider the tax implications, growth potential, and your long-term goals when choosing how much to contribute to each type of account.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a tailored strategy, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide advice based on your specific situation. 

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize for both growth and tax efficiency.
