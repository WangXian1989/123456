Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it’s essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. 

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide flexibility, but investment gains will be taxed each year. 

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer timeline until retirement, you might want to take more risks in your taxable account since long-term capital gains can be more favorable.
   - For short-term goals, lean towards safer investments that minimize tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that you're not overly concentrated in one type of account. Consider your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to align with your evolving financial situation and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that considers your unique circumstances.

By carefully balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize your tax benefits and align your investments with your financial objectives.
