Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline to help you strategize:

### **1. Consider the Tax Advantages**
- **401(k) Plans:** Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, which can lower your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first.
- **IRAs (Traditional and Roth):** 
  - **Traditional IRA:** Also offers tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth until you withdraw in retirement. 
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
  
### **2. Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
- Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. Consider short-term savings in taxable accounts for any upcoming expenses.

### **3. Diversification of Accounts**
- Different accounts may offer varied investment options. Use your taxable accounts for more liquid investments or shorter-term goals and keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### **4. Balance Growth and Risk**
- Allocate more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
- Keep your taxable accounts for investments that are expected to produce more taxable income or for those you're likely to sell within a few years.

### **5. Review and Adjust Regularly**
- Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in tax laws, and shifts in your financial situation or goals.

### **Example Allocation Strategy:**
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 5-10% of your salary).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation (2023 limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any extra savings here, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

Adjust this strategy according to your unique circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### **In Summary**
Focus on tax advantages, balance need for liquidity, and align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and goals. Stay proactive in managing your account allocations as your circumstances change.
