Live Deeply! Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you can.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Funds in a 401(k) and IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw them. In contrast, taxable accounts will incur taxes on dividends and capital gains. Depending on your current tax rate versus retirement expectations, it might be wise to prioritize the tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors may choose a more aggressive portfolio, while those nearing retirement may want to shift to a more conservative allocation.

4. **Regularly Reassess**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's important to regularly review and adjust your allocations.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about how and when you plan to withdraw funds. Early retirement might necessitate a different strategy compared to a traditional retirement age.

If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
