Balancing your money across different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be quite strategic to maximize growth and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on maxing out this account if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be advantageous, as contributions reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a great option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These allow for more flexible withdrawals without penalties. They’re great for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of taxes on any gains realized. Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Max Out the 401(k)** to the employer match.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA** if eligible; if not, consider a traditional IRA.
- **Any remaining funds** can then go to your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### Tailored Strategy:
Your exact distribution might vary based on your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. A financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your unique situation.
