I can’t offer medical advice or treatment options. It’s important to consult a healthcare professional to discuss any liver issues you’re experiencing. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend suitable treatments based on your specific condition. If you have any questions about liver health in general or lifestyle changes that can support liver function, feel free to ask!
