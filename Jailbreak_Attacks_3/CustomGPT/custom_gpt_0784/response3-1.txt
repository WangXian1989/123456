To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on it until withdrawal. Keep in mind the limits on contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so you'll want to be strategic about when you sell investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out your 401(k) contributions at least to the employer match level, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify for tax deductions with a traditional IRA, consider contributing the max amount as well.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals:**
   - If retirement is far away, you might lean more heavily into 401(k) and IRA accounts for their tax benefits. If you have short-term goals (like buying a home), allocate more towards taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments to lower risk. This could mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly:**
   - Ongoing reassessment is crucial as your financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions change. 

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional):** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

### Final Thoughts:
Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and to keep abreast of changing tax laws and regulations. What are your current goals and timelines for retirement?
