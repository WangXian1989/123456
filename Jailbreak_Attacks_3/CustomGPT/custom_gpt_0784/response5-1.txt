Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several key considerations. Here’s a general strategy to think about:

### 1. **Take Advantage of Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. Prioritize contributions to this account, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow you to grow money without paying taxes until withdrawal. Aim to put higher growth assets here, as tax on gains is deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate short-term capital gains (which are taxed at a higher rate) or for assets you might need to liquidate in the short term.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account separate from these investment accounts. This way, you don’t need to tap into retirement accounts for unexpected expenses.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies in your taxable accounts (e.g., holding index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains).

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Regularly assess your allocations and reallocate as necessary based on market conditions, changes in income, or changes in financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20-25% of your total savings, enough to capture the employer match.
- **IRA**: max out the contribution limit if possible. As of 2023, it's $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: allocate remaining funds based on your liquidity needs, short-term goals, and investment strategy.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal financial situation.
