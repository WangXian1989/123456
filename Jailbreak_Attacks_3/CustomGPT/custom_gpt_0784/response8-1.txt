Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider if after-tax contributions fit your strategy.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction upfront, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them beneficial if you expect your income to be higher in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of annual contribution limits and consider prioritizing IRAs if they allow for investment choices beyond your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends, interest, and capital gains. 
   - **Liquidity**: If you need access to funds before retirement, taxable accounts are more flexible compared to retirement accounts with penalties for early withdrawal.

### Suggested Strategy:

- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Fund a Roth IRA (if eligible)**: After getting the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Continue Funding 401(k) or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, continue to contribute to these accounts.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts, consider putting additional savings in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### Other Considerations:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio as your investments grow and your financial situation changes.
- **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can significantly impact the best strategy, so tailored advice is often beneficial.
