Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and your retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment options available within your 401(k). Often, these can be limited compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $6,500 for those under 50, and $7,500 for those 50 and older.
   - **Flexibility:** IRAs often provide a wider range of investment choices compared to employer-sponsored plans.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Taxable accounts allow easy access to funds without penalties, making them ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before diverting funds elsewhere.
2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider maximizing Roth IRA contributions next for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once the above contributions are maximized, keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize any additional funds for investments in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

### Example Distribution
- If you earn $100,000, consider contributing:
  - **401(k)**: $20,000 (for those aiming for 86% coverage)
  - **Roth IRA**: $6,500
  - **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds after necessary expenses and savings.

It's crucial to review your financial situation, consult with a financial advisor, and adjust your strategy as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and goals.
