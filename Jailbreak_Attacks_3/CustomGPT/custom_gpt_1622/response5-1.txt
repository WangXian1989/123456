(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing enough to reach the annual limit if itâ€™s feasible within your budget.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If eligible, aim to maximize your contributions to an IRA after you've taken advantage of your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals or if you plan to retire early.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

1. **Hit the 401(k) Hard**: If your job matches contributions, get that free cash first. It's like getting a bonus for saving your money! After that, aim to max it out. Think about your future self â€” theyâ€™ll thank you.

2. **IRA Party**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (for the tax perks now) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals later). If you can, fill up those limits after you're all set with the 401(k). No need to skimp here!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed your retirement options, dive into taxable accounts. These bad boys give you more freedom. You can access cash without penalties and invest in whatever floats your boat.
