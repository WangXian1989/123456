Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k):** Consider contributing at least enough to get your employer’s match, then max out your IRA (if eligible).
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can be a great option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility, as withdrawals are not subject to penalties.

4. **Investment Strategies:** 
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term investments, as these accounts are typically for retirement and may have penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) and strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust According to Goals:** Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified according to your risk tolerance—this applies across all account types.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For a personalized strategy based on your specific situation, consider discussing with a financial advisor.

This approach aims to utilize the benefits of each account type effectively while aligning with your financial goals.
