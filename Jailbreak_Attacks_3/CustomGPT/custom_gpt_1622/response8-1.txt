Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Consider contributing the maximum allowed if your budget permits.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions up front.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Invest in **taxable accounts** for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in the future. Capital gains and dividends are taxed, but you can utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored for each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, you might want riskier assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - In retirement, carefully plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to keep growing.

5. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits and Rules**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits and income restrictions for IRAs, which can change periodically.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the nuances of tax implications and individual circumstances, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice and strategies.

By following these steps, you can optimize the distribution of your investments and ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.
