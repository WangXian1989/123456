To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Ideal for high earners who want to reduce their tax burden now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on realized gains and dividends. Useful for flexible withdrawals and short-term goals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of tax benefits and compounding growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Funds for near-term goals should be placed in taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match (free money).
   - Consider contributing to an IRA after your 401(k) to maximize tax benefits, within annual limits.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan retirement withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, focusing on employer match first.
- **IRA**: Aim to contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible; otherwise, use a traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Supplement retirement savings and hold funds for short-term goals.

### Example:
- **If you're 30 and targeting retirement**:
  - 401(k): 15% of income
  - IRA: 10% of income 
  - Taxable: 5% of income 

Consider your risk tolerance and adjust investments within each account to align with your long-term financial objectives. Consulting a financial advisor could also provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
