Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now. Choose based on your tax bracket now versus retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, funnel additional funds into your 401(k) up to its limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have money left, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for short-term goals or for withdrawing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while keeping higher-growth, potentially higher-tax assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
