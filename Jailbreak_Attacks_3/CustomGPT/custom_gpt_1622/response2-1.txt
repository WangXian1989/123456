Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations to optimize your overall financial strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)), and investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Contributions may offer tax advantages, and earnings grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments outside retirement vehicles. They can generate capital gains and dividends, which are taxable but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Good for high-income earners expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** No taxes on qualified withdrawals, making it favorable if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Pay taxes annually on dividends and capital gains, but allows for more liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts can be a good strategy.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth (stocks), while those closer to retirement may prioritize capital preservation (bonds).

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation annually or as your goals change and make adjustments to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### 7. **Individual Goals and Circumstances:**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match (15-20%).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here for short-term goals or liquidity (remaining funds).

This balanced approach can help you build a robust financial future while considering tax efficiency and retirement readiness.
