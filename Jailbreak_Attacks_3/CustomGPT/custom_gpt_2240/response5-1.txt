(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.
3. **Diversify Investments**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to balance risk and return.
4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that funds in a taxable account may be subject to capital gains tax, so plan withdrawals strategically.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First for Free Money**: If your employer matches contributions, max that out! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions.
2. **IRA Love**: After snagging that 401(k) match, dive into your IRA. Traditional or Roth? Pick based on your current vs. future tax situation; Roths rock if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later.
3. **Taxable Accounts Hold the Flexibility**: Toss some money into taxable accounts since they give you the flexibility to access funds without penalties. Just watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes!
4. **Dive into Diversification**: Spread your investments across all accounts. Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket â€“ nobody wants an omelette of regrets!
