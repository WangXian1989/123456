Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maximized your contributions, continue to do so, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions depending on your income.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. These accounts can be more flexible but may have tax implications for capital gains and dividends.

### 4. **Consider Tax Strategies**
   - Hold investments with higher tax implications (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these can be taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account (like a high-yield savings account).

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Conclusion
There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
