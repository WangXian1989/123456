Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Higher Contributions**: Contribute the maximum allowed if you can, as these are pre-tax dollars, which can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA fits your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually, focusing on Roth if you expect higher taxes in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Utilize After-Tax Dollars**: Invest additional savings here for flexibility. You can withdraw these funds anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **General Tips**:
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
   - **Consider Withdrawals**: For short-term needs, use taxable accounts to avoid penalties on retirement accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
