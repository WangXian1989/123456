Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k):**
   - Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the limit. This defers your tax liability until retirement, potentially reducing your overall tax burden.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liability, like index funds or long-term capital gain investments. These can be beneficial for flexibility and withdrawal without penalties.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For short-term goals (less than five years), lean towards safer investments in taxable accounts. For long-term goals, take advantage of the growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure consistency with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A personalized assessment by a financial advisor can help tailor your distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.

This strategic approach can optimize your investments while considering tax implications and your financial goals.
