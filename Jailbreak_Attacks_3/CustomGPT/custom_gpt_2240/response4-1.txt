Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Make contributions up to the match limit first, then assess if you can contribute more based on your budget.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. The contribution limits for IRAs are lower than for 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use any extra funds for taxable accounts. This is especially useful for investing funds you might need before retirement, as they provide more flexibility.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of how taxes will affect your withdrawals in retirement. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, consider a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Check the allocations annually or when significant life changes occur (e.g., job change, marriage). Adjust as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.
