Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires consideration of factors like tax implications, contribution limits, and your overall financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for long-term growth.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may also be tax-deductible, depending on income and participation in an employer plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While there are no tax benefits, they offer more liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - In 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an extra $1,000 catch-up for those over 50). Prioritize maxing these before moving to taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Evaluate Fees**: Look for funds with low expense ratios in your 401(k) and IRA. Compare these to your taxable account fees.

6. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals**: Align contributions with your goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and taxable accounts for short-term needs.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.
