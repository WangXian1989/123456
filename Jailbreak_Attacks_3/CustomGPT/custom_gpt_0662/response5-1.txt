The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as your contributions grow tax-free.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit. This will reduce your taxable income and help you save for retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might want to access before retirement (e.g., buying a home, emergencies). This gives you liquidity and the ability to manage your capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from traditional retirement accounts will be taxed as income in retirement, whereas capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate. Plan your withdrawals strategically.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your asset allocation and account types based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

This approach helps optimize your savings while considering tax impacts and flexibility. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
