To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Balance investments across stocks, bonds, and cash in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Retirement Drawdown:** Plan withdrawals from your 401(k) and IRA carefully to manage tax liabilities.

By prioritizing tax efficiency and diversification, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and stability.
