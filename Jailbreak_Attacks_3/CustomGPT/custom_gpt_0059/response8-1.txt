The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: 
   - If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - If you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA could be beneficial for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might be less tax-efficient, like stocks or funds you intend to hold long-term. This helps in applying favorable long-term capital gains tax.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**: 
   - If you need liquidity for short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts. 
   - For long-term growth, favor tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Think through how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can minimize your tax burden.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
