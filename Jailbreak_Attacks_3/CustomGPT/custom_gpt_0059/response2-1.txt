To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and income level.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider target-date funds which adjust as you approach retirement.
   - **IRA:** Similar to your 401(k), but you may have more investment options. Balance your portfolio for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for short- to medium-term goals. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-deferred (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains tax; hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you keep a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing all available funds.

### 5. **Periodically Reassess**
   - Review your asset allocation and rebalance regularly to align with changing financial goals or market conditions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- 401(k): 15% of income
- IRA: 10% of income
- Taxable Accounts: Remainder after maximizing above contributions

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this to your specific situation and goals.
