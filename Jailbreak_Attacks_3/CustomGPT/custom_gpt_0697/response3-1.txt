Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Your choice affects your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: General investment accounts with no tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are taxable.

2. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement timeline, how much you wish to save, and your expected retirement lifestyle.
   - Consider short-term vs. long-term goals.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Understand that interest, dividends, and capital gains in these accounts will be taxed in the year they are realized.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to balance risk and return.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these investments before contributing heavily to any investment accounts.

7. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Make regular contributions to all accounts. Automate contributions where possible.

8. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your investment allocations and make adjustments based on market conditions, life changes, and financial goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice from a financial professional to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

In summary, prioritize maximizing your 401(k) contributions to get any employer match, then focus on funding tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. Use taxable accounts for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged options. Regularly review your strategy based on your evolving financial situation.
