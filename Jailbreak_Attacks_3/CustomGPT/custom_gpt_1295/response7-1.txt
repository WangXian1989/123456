Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains tax on profits; however, you can offset gains with losses.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or stocks held long-term.

### 4. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize tax impacts, using tax-advantaged accounts first when needed.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize this strategy based on your personal circumstances, goals, and changes in tax laws.
