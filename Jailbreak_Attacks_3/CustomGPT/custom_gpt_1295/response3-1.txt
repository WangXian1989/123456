Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions may be pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If it's a Roth 401(k), contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Your choice should depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** As of 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older). Prioritize contributions here after maximizing your 401(k) match if you have enough savings.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Money can be accessed anytime without penalties, which is beneficial for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term capital gains receive favorable tax rates.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize 401(k) Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund IRA:** After the match, direct funds into your IRA, preferably maxing out contributions.
3. **Return to 401(k):** If you still have funds available, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions if beneficial.
4. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts:** Any funds left after maxing out retirement accounts can be allocated to taxable accounts for more flexibility.

### **Review and Adjust**
- **Revisit Your Plan:** Regularly check your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your savings for both current needs and future retirement goals.
