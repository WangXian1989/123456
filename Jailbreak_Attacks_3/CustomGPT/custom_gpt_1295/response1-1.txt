Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account before investing.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider your tax situation; traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, while Roth contributions are tax-free in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, this might be beneficial.
   - If you’re not eligible for a Roth, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, depending on your income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Invest in taxable accounts once you’ve maxed out retirement accounts. Use these for goals within the next 5-10 years.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level as market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
