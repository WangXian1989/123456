Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.” If your employer doesn’t offer a match, consider contributing up to the annual limit (which is $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (up to $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50). Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals), based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings or investments beyond retirement accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains. Municipal bonds or index funds can be good options.

### 3. Diversification & Risk Tolerance:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 4. Adjust Based on Age:
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in the 401(k) and IRAs.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 5. Monitor & Rebalance:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market performance and changing life circumstances.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, take advantage of employer matches, and ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
