Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you may also be eligible for a traditional or Roth IRA. Contributing to these can help reduce your taxable income.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are tax-deductible, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts donâ€™t offer tax benefits upfront, but you pay taxes on capital gains and dividends, so consider holding investments there that generate long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For medium-term goals (e.g., buying a house), a mix of IRAs and taxable accounts might be suitable.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent saving and investing.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on your changing risk tolerance, goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that considers your unique financial situation and goals. Balancing contributions wisely can maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
