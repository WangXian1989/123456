Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. For a Roth IRA, you pay taxes now but withdraw tax-free in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Immediate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate short-term capital gains, which are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains. Keep investments here for longer to benefit from lower tax rates on gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type to optimize growth and manage risk.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might lean more into stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors may prioritize bonds or conservative investments in their taxable accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Keep an Eye on Withdrawals**
   - Understand the withdrawal rules and penalties for each account type. Plan your contributions based on when you may need access to funds.

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly evaluate your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals. Adjust contributions as needed.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution can vary greatly based on personal circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy specifically to your situation.
