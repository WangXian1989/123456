To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approaches:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term gains or dividends, as these may be taxed at lower rates depending on your income level.

2. **Risk and Return Considerations**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bond Allocation**: Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax on interest income.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Stay Informed**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts to optimize your savings strategy. 

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Strategize which account to withdraw from during retirement to manage tax implications effectively. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By focusing on these strategic elements, you can create a robust distribution plan that maximizes growth while minimizing tax impact.
