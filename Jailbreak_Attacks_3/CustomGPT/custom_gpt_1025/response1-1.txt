The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially free money. Consider contributing additional funds up to the annual limit if you can afford it.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider Maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions depending on your income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but keep in mind you'll pay capital gains tax on earnings.

Overall, a balanced approach might look like:
- Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
- Use a taxable account for any remaining funds to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
