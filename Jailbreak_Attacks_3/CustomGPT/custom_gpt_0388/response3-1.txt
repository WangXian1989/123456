   c. Current savings

2. Determine contribution limits:
   a. 401(k) contribution max
   b. IRA contribution max
   c. Taxable account flexibility

3. Allocate funds based on tax efficiency:
   a. Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for tax advantages:
      i. Max out employer match in 401(k)
      ii. Max out IRA contributions
   b. Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity needs.

4. Diversify investments across accounts:
   a. Stocks, bonds, ETFsâ€”different proportions based on risk tolerance.
