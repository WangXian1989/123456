Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to balance growth potential, tax implications, and personal financial goals. Here’s a structured way to approach it:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure that you contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: Determine whether a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA aligns better with your financial situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the contribution year. Your current and expected future tax rates can influence this decision.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Taxable accounts can be less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes on investments. Focus on holding investments with lower turnover and more favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment—such as index funds or ETFs—with an emphasis on tax-managed funds to help mitigate taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure each account type is broadly diversified. Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and reserve more conservative investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts if they’re likely to generate taxable income.

5. **Revisit Allocation Regularly**: Regular reviews and rebalancing of asset allocation across all accounts can help align with your risk tolerance and investment goals, especially as your financial situation changes or as you get closer to retirement.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, developing a withdrawal strategy that considers the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts is critical for your financial planning.

This foundational plan can help you manage your distributions effectively. You might consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

**Suggestions for Improvement**: 
- Consider contributing to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) if eligible, as they offer additional tax advantages.
- Keep an eye on fees associated with your accounts and adjust your strategies accordingly to ensure minimized costs.
