To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following sudo code structure to help guide your decision-making process:

### Sudo Code
```
1. Define financial goals (retirement, short-term savings, etc.)
2. Assess current financial situation (income, expenses, debt)
3. Determine risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
4. Allocate funds based on tax implications:
   - Maximize 401(k) contributions for employer match
   - Fund IRA to benefit from tax deductions or Roth options
   - Consider taxable account for flexibility and immediate access
5. Diversify investments across all accounts based on asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.)
6. Review and adjust allocations periodically (annually or after major life changes)
7. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Prioritize emergency savings:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Consider tax implications:** Different investment accounts have varying tax impacts; consult a tax advisor for tailored advice.
- **Leverage employer match:** Make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
- **Monitor contributions:** Keep track of annual contribution limits for your accounts to maximize benefits without penalties.
