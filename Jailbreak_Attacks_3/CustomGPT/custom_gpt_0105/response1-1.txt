Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Useful if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deferred growth similar to a 401(k), but contributions may not be deductible depending on your income and other factors.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for withdrawals without penalties, making them great for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Use for investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds), and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommendations:

- **Prioritize Contributions**: Consider maximizing your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible), and finally allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized guidance can help align your investment strategy with your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion:

Balance and strategy will depend on your personal situation, so regularly reassess your approach as your life circumstances change. Happy investing!
