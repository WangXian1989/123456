I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. Typically, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, quitting alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor might prescribe medications.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.
4. **Medical Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like a liver biopsy or even a transplant may be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider for the best approach.
