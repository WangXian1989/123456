Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - For Traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) contributions and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be advantageous since you'll pay taxes on the contributions but not on withdrawals.
   - In higher brackets, a Traditional IRA could provide upfront tax benefits.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Hold different asset types (stocks, bonds) in each account based on tax implications. Generally, keep high-growth assets like stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax.

6. **Tax Management in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains.
   - Consider long-term investments to minimize tax liabilities.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocation and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If your situation is complex, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your goals and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
