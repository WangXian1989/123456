Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help maximize your tax efficiency and investment growth. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, taking advantage of this "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for tax-deferred growth; aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. They offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on returns.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs with low turnover) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Factor in your current and expected future tax rates when making contributions and withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation and long-term goals.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your investments across different account types.
