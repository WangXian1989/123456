Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any matching contributions from your employer, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Focus on tax-advantaged growth.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After the IRA, put additional funds into your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for after-tax investments, especially for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out other accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the tax implications of withdrawing funds from retirement accounts.

### Summary:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute to match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions.
3. **401(k)**: Continue to max out.
4. **Taxable**: Invest surplus funds.
