1. **Consult a Specialist**: It's vital to see a hepatologist or a gastroenterologist for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to help your liver function properly.

3. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed. This could include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or supplements for fatty liver.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests to monitor liver function are important.
