Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income year, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for additional tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible based on your income, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement because qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. Here, you might focus on:
   - Investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds from each account, considering tax implications. Typically, you will want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary greatly, so consulting a financial advisor can help tailor strategies to your specific situation.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial goals and market conditions change. This dynamic approach can help you optimize your retirement savings over time.
