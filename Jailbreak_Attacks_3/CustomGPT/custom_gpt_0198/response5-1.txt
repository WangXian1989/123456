Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach to think about:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money." Additionally, contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on that income until you withdraw it in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two can depend on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for more flexible financial goals, such as saving for short-term needs or withdrawing funds without penalties. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so tax-efficient investment strategies such as holding stocks for the long term and choosing municipal bonds can be beneficial.

Balance your contributions based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and any immediate financial needs you might have. A financial advisor can also offer personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

Always remember to diversify your investments to better manage risk and aim for long-term growth.
