Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider adding funds to an IRA. Choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes when sold, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all account types. This can minimize risk and optimize returns. Consider how asset allocation varies slightly based on account type due to different tax implications.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - For retirement accounts, focus on long-term growth (stocks) if you have a long time until retirement. In taxable accounts, consider a mix that allows for both growth and income if you might need access to funds sooner.

5. **Review Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals. Rebalance as needed.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match, then max out if possible.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any excess savings, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.
