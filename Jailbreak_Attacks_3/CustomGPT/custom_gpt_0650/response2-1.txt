To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for at least the maximum allowable contribution if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Depending on whether you prefer a traditional or Roth IRA, contribute to maximize potential tax benefits. In 2024, the annual contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) here, as you'll incur taxes on capital gains and dividends. This can include strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider a mix of equities, bonds, and other asset classes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to stay in line with your long-term goals.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Strategies include drawing from taxable first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Personal Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess your financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance to guide your overall asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your income per year.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum limit.
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate any remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

Tailoring this approach to your unique financial situation will help optimize your savings strategy.
