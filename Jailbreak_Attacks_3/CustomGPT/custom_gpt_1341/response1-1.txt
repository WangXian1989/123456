Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money). This offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxes, like stocks or funds you hold for less than a year.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they generate regular income that is taxed.

### 4. **Periodic Review:**
   - Reassess your allocations regularly based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, or retirement goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your salary up to the employer match.
- **IRA:** Maximum annual contribution ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts for tax benefits, and strategically use taxable accounts for flexibility. Adjust based on your financial goals and market changes.
