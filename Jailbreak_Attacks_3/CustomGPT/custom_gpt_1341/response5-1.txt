Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if your budget allows (the limit for 2024 is $23,000).
   
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute up to the maximum limit (for 2024, it’s $6,500). Choose a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. Opt for a Traditional IRA if you need the current tax deduction.

2. **Consider Asset Location:**
   - Place bonds and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep stocks or ETFs in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for additional savings once retirement accounts are maxed out. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a separate emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses, ideally in a high-yield savings account.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Adjust your contributions based on life changes, investment performance, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation and goals.
