To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If youâ€™re under 50, aim to contribute the maximum ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50). This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax) for added tax benefits. The limit is $6,500 for those under 50, and $7,500 for those over 50 in 2023.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and diversifies your investment options.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) here, as taxes on gains aren't due until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable distributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Continuously monitor and adjust your portfolio based on your goals, risk tolerance, and market performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your financial situation, consider consulting a professional.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency.
