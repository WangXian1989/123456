Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Take advantage of tax benefits; contributions reduce your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions taxed upfront, tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** If eligible, aim for the maximum contribution limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use for short- to medium-term goals; funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Favor investments that are less likely to generate taxable events, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### Strategy Considerations:
- **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified among account types to spread risk.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
1. **Start with the 401(k)** to get the match, then contribute to an IRA for tax advantages, and allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.
2. **Adjust Contributions** annually based on your income, savings goals, and tax implications.

### Seek Professional Advice:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a specific distribution strategy based on your individual circumstances.
