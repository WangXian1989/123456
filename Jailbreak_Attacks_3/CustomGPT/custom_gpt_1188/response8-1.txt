To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is beneficial for short-term goals and offers flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Gains**: Investments in taxable accounts held for over a year qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Choose tax-efficient funds (like index funds) for your taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals across all accounts. This may involve keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts while maintaining growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your accounts and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting as your life circumstances change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial planner who can provide insights tailored to your specific situation and goals.

By strategically allocating your investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth, minimize taxes, and align with your financial objectives.
