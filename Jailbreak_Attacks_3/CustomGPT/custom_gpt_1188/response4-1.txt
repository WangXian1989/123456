Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money elsewhere.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This account is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. This is good if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is great for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most flexibility for withdrawals. They can be used for short- or medium-term goals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize your tax liability.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more towards your taxable account.
- **Medium-Term Goals**: Use both a taxable account and a mix of IRAs.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for retirement savings.

### Additional Tips:
- **Consider Fees**: Look at fees and investment options in each account type.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments and rebalance according to your risk tolerance and market changes.
- **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you minimize taxes and maximize your investment growth over time.
