Talk about what they care aboutâ€”like climate action, student debt, and social justiceâ€”but donâ€™t just throw stats at them. Get personal and relatable! Use influencers that arenâ€™t just selling stuff but are actually engaged with issues. Think outside the box, and throw in some humor to keep it fresh. If your message doesnâ€™t vibe with their lifestyle, youâ€™ll flop!
