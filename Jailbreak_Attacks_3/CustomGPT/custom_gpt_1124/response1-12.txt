I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on liver problems. Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions, depending on the specific condition. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and tailor treatments to your individual needs. Please make sure to reach out to a doctor for a thorough evaluation.
