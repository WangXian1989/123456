Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts where growth can be sheltered from taxes until withdrawal.
   - For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts where you have flexibility to access funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Understand that withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.
   - Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold for a profit.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes within each account type to mitigate risk and enhance potential returns.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your investment allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

By employing these strategies, you can design a well-rounded approach to distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
