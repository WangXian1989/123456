Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, but distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and can be accessed anytime, but capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they're realized.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your asset allocation based on your time horizon and risk tolerance. Typically, longer-term investments may take on more risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.
