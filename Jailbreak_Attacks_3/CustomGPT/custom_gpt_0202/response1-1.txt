Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but your eligibility may be limited based on income.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions if you can. This is especially important if your tax bracket is higher now.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across sectors to mitigate risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
