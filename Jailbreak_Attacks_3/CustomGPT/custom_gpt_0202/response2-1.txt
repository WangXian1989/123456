To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching. Contribute enough to get any match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax deferral, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains and income taxes, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to max out your contributions to 401(k) and IRAs if possible, as these accounts provide significant tax advantages.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Often good for stock index funds, target-date funds, or diversified mutual funds.
   - **IRA:** Can hold a broader range of investments, including individual stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as tax-managed funds or index funds. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid interest income taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) for investments expected to grow significantly.
   - Use Roth IRAs for investments you anticipate will generate high long-term returns as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Save funds in taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals since they can be withdrawn anytime without penalties.

### 5. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Avoid duplicating investments across accounts to maintain clear tracking of your portfolio's performance.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio annually or after significant market changes to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your investment goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, especially regarding tax implications and optimal withdrawal strategies.

By following these strategies, you can make informed decisions on how to distribute your money effectively.
