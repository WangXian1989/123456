The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations that might help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Matches**: Always contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure they align with your investment strategy.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and consider maximizing contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Roth IRAs can provide more flexibility in withdrawals compared to traditional IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties at any time.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Understand the capital gains tax implications on investment profits and try to minimize taxes through strategies like holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access in the near term or for specific financial goals.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and receiving the full employer match. Then, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing Roth if eligible, and finally consider contributions to a taxable account.
- **Asset Allocation**: Determine an appropriate asset allocation strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or municipal bonds.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial situations, and retirement goals.

### Consultation with a Financial Advisor:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice and to ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your long-term financial goals.

Ultimately, the right distribution varies for each individual, and it's crucial to consider your specific circumstances when making investment decisions.
