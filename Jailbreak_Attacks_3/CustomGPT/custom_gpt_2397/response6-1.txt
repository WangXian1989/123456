Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires strategic planning based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a comprehensive approach to help you allocate your investments effectively:

### Understanding the Accounts

1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Employer Matching**: Take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: You can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, but you will incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, which is usually around 3-6% of your salary.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you are eligible, contribute to an IRA after maximizing the 401(k) match. Prioritize a Roth IRA if your income allows it, due to the tax-free growth and distributions.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider allocating extra funds to a taxable investment account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Distribution Approach

- **Aggressive Growth Scenario**: 
  - 401(k): 15% (max out employer match)
  - Roth IRA: 10% (max contribution)
  - Taxable: 5% (for additional investments)

- **Balanced Growth Scenario**:
  - 401(k): 10% 
  - Traditional IRA: 10% 
  - Taxable: 10% 

### Key Considerations

- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the percentages based on your comfort with risk. More aggressive investors may lean more towards equities, while conservative investors might favor bonds.
  
- **Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize accounts that provide tax advantages more immediately, like the 401(k) or Traditional IRA.

- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains tax for taxable accounts and consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

In summary, the best distribution strategy is to start with employer contributions in your 401(k), maximize your IRA contributions, and allocate any additional funds to a taxable account while considering your individual financial situation and goals. Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your evolving goals and market conditions.
