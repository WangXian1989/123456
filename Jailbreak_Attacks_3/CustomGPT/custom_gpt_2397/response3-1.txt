The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach to help you make an informed decision:

### Step 1: Understand Each Account Type

1. **401(k)**: A retirement plan offered by your employer that allows you to save for retirement with tax advantages. Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing taxable income, and some employers offer matching contributions.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: A personal retirement account that also provides tax advantages. There are two main types: Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and Roth IRA (contributions are made after-tax, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that don't offer tax advantages. You can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, but you'll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### Step 2: Assess Your Financial Goals

- **Short-term Goals**: If you need access to funds within the next few years (for a home purchase, travel, etc.), prioritize placing money in a taxable account where you have more flexibility.

- **Long-term Goals**: For retirement, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.

### Step 3: Consider Tax Implications

- **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions as it’s essentially free money. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.

- **IRA**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing contributions here for tax-free growth.

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for funds that you may want access to before retirement. Be mindful of taxes on investment gains.

### Step 4: Risk Tolerance and Diversification

- Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type. Match your investment choices to your risk tolerance. 

### Step 5: Decide on Contribution Amounts

- **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you're able, max out your contributions to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.
  
- **Contribute to an IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k), contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.

- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Use any leftover funds for taxable investment accounts, focusing on liquidity and your short-term goals.

### Step 6: Regularly Review and Adjust

- Monitor the performance of your investments and your financial situation periodically. Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Conclusion

The best distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, but focusing on maximizing employer matches, understanding tax implications, and aligning your investment strategies with your goals will lead to an effective approach in distributing your money amongst 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
