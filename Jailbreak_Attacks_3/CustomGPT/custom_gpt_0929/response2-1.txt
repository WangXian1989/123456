Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” The limit for 2023 is $22,500, with an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you're over 50.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation. The limit for 2023 is $6,500, with a $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA reduce your taxable income now but are taxed when withdrawn in retirement. Roth accounts, however, are taxed upfront but offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account.
   - Consider using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize taxes on gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you are far from retirement, you can afford to take more risk in your 401(k) and IRA. In contrast, if you need those funds soon, lean towards more conservative investments.
  
### 5. **Continuous Review and Adjustment:**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Sample Distribution:
- **Retirement Focused (Younger):** 50% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, 20% in taxable.
- **Mid-Career:** 40% in 401(k), 30% in IRA, 30% in taxable.
- **Pre-Retirement:** 30% in 401(k), 40% in IRA, 30% in taxable.
  
### Conclusion:
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances and to navigate any tax complexities.
