To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k), with tax deductions depending on income levels.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding assets that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2024, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those 50+).
   - Traditional/Roth IRA: $6,500 (with a catch-up contribution of $1,000 for those 50+).

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since they can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Stable income-producing investments (like bonds) may be better placed in taxable accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

5. **Liquid Needs**: Keep an eye on your liquidity needs. Taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties, while withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA accounts before retirement age can incur penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for better long-term growth and tax efficiency.
