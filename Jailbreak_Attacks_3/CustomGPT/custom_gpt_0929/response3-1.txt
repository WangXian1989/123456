Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-term Needs**: If you plan to access funds in the next few years, prioritize taxable accounts. 
   - **Retirement Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: In 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but income and capital gains taxes apply.

### 3. **Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now; tax-deferred growth until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Allows for tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on dividends and short-term capital gains at your regular income tax rate, but long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Higher-Risk Investments**: Consider holding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Lower-Risk Investments**: Bonds may be more suitable for taxable accounts due to their interest being taxed as ordinary income.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diverse mix of asset classes across all accounts, optimizing for growth in retirement accounts while maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation annually and adjust contributions based on performance and changing goals.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and future plans.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 50% 
- **IRA (especially if Roth)**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

Adjust these percentages based on your unique financial situation, goals, and age.
