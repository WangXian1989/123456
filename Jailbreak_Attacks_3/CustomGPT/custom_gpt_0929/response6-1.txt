Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA (for tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your income and tax preferences.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate significant taxable income or short-term capital gains. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Distribute investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes in each account to align with your overall investment strategy.

### 4. **Withdrawal Timing and Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to be tax-efficient, taking funds from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your total investments, prioritizing employer match.
- **IRA:** Up to full contribution limit, depending on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds based on current liquidity needs and future investment goals.

### Final Thoughts
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.
- Consult a financial advisor for tailored guidance based on your unique situation. 

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to funding your retirement while considering tax efficiencies and investment growth.
