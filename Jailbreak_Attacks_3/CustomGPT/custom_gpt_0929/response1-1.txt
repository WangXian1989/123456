Distributing your money among different types of accounts—like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, and consider maxing it out if you can afford to. These contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
     - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using a taxable account for additional investments. This account offers flexibility but is subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).

6. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, financial goals, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially considering your unique situation and future goals.

This strategy can help you build a balanced portfolio that maximizes your growth potential while minimizing tax impacts.
