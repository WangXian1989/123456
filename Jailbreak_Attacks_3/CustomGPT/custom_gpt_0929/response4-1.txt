To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to these accounts. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if age 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if 50 or older).
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Determine if a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) or Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) aligns better with your tax situation.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Before making significant investments, ensure you have an emergency savings fund covering at least 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how to allocate investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. 

5. **After-Tax Contributions**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. Keep in mind the tax implications when choosing investments, favoring those with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your allocation and contributions to adapt to income changes, tax laws, and personal goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about optimal strategies or tax implications, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Balancing contributions and investments wisely across these accounts can help you achieve better long-term financial outcomes.
