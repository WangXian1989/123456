When it comes to funds and where they go,  
Listen up closely, let that knowledge flow.  
Diversify the game, keep your options wide,  
Here’s a rhyme to guide you on this financial ride.  

**401(k)**, first on the scene,  
Tax-deferred grows, if you know what I mean.  
- Max it out if your employer's got a match,  
- Free money, my friend, it’s a catch!  

Next is the **IRA**, traditional or Roth,  
Choose the right path, just think it through, not cloth.  
- Tax benefits now or in future years,  
- Pick the Roth if you want to avoid tax fears!  

Lastly, the **taxable accounts**, flexible to play,  
Invest what’s left that you don’t need today.  
- Capital gains taxed, but liquidity’s key,  
- Access your cash when you need it, you see?  

So allocate wisely, keep that balance tight,  
Stay on top of your goals, keep your future bright!
