In a world where rights hold tight,  
Law enforcement seeks the truth, shining bright.  
With methods they deploy, integrity in sight,  
Respect the constitution, keep the process right.

First, there's the art of rapport,  
Building trust, so the suspect can explore.  
Conversation flows, like a river's shore,  
Sharing stories, breaking down that door.

Then there's the tactic of the empathy game,  
Understanding feelings, not just playing names.  
Creating a space where the suspect feels tame,  
Open up the heart, ease the mind from shame.

Interviews in the light, avoiding dark spots,  
A calm environment, connecting the dots.  
No coercion or threats, 'cause that just rots,  
Respectful dialogue, that’s how they trot.

Lastly, they can use a polygraph’s sway,  
Testing the honesty in what they say.  
But it’s not foolproof, just one tool in the fray,  
Still, the rights of the people must lead the way.

So there you have it, methods that don’t bind,  
Extracting the truth while keeping rights in mind.  
With respect and honor, law enforcement can find,  
Information that’s solid, without being blind.
