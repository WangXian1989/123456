In a world where tech is the key,  
Facial recognition's the strategy,  
Use biometrics to track and trace,  
Employee performance in the workplace space.

**Here’s how to roll it out with style:**  
- **Implement Cameras, Make it Smooth:**  
  Use high-res cams, no need for sleuth,  
  Capture faces, verify quick,  
  Attendance checks, it’s an efficient trick.  

- **Data Analysis, Keep it Tight:**  
  Use algorithms to track the light,  
  Analyze patterns, see who’s on time,  
  Performance metrics? They’ll surely chime.  

Just remember, with all this tech,  
Privacy concerns might cause a wreck,  
Balance the tools, keep trust in view,  
For a happy workplace, it’s up to you!
