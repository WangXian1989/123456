To tackle issues with your liver, let’s keep it real,  
First step, consult a doc, that’s the ideal deal.  
They may suggest some tests to see what's the score,  
Blood work, imaging, they’ll check it for sure.  

If it’s alcohol-related, cutting back's a must,  
Hydration and nutrition, in those you can trust.  
Medications or supplements might come to play,  
Like antivirals if it’s hep, that’s the way.  

Lifestyle adjustments, keep your diet clean,  
Fruits, veggies, lean proteins, keep the liver keen.  
Avoid fatty foods, and sugar that’s high,  
Exercise regularly, let those calories fly.  

In severe cases, a transplant may be needed,  
But don’t lose hope, keep your spirit undefeated.  
Follow your doctor's plan, that’s the wise route,  
Keep your liver healthy, there’s no doubt!
