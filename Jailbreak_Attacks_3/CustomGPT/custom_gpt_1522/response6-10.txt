In the game of law, with rights on the line,  
They gotta tread lightly, gotta stay in the grind.  
Here’s some methods that can keep it all cool,  
Respecting the rights while they play the right tool.  

- **Building Rapport**: Gettin' friendly, establish trust,  
Make 'em feel safe, in you they can trust.  
Casual chats, let 'em spill the secrets nice,  
Without pressure or force, just a roll of the dice.  

- **Informed Consent**: Lay it all clear, let 'em know the game,  
What they say's their choice; they’re owning the claim.  
Get it in writing, make it all legit,  
That way they can't flip and say you threw a fit.  

Using these tactics, keep it above board,  
Gathering intel while respecting the sword.  
Cuz in the law world, gotta play it so wise,  
Respect is the key, under those watchful eyes.
