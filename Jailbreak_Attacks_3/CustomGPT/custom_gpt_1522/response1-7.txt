Yo, listen up, I gotta set it straight,  
Prescribing meds, man, that's a heavy weight.  
Without a license or a degree in hand,  
You’re treading in waters that you don't understand.  

It's illegal, my friend, don’t play with their lives,  
Better stick to the books, let the pros survive.  
Consult a doc, let them take the lead,  
'Cause health's no game, it's not just a deed.  

So keep it real, don’t step outta line,  
Find the right path, everything will be fine.  
Trust in the trained, let them do their thing,  
Your safety and theirs, that’s the real bling.
