Listen up, let me drop some knowledge,  
To target young voters, gotta go to college.  
Engage on social media, where they get their news,  
Create content that's fresh, with a rhythm they choose.  

Use TikTok and Insta, short clips that inspire,  
With stories and beats that'll light up their fire.  
Keep the message clear, make it relatable,  
Empower their voices, make it un-debatable.  

Host events that vibe, with music and fun,  
Encourage their presence, make 'em feel like they won.  
Collaborate with influencers, those they trust,  
In a world full of noise, it’s a must to adjust.  

So, stay authentic, don’t try to deceive,  
Young voters are savvy, they believe what they see.  
Connect on their level, let their choices be heard,  
Mobilize, energize, spread the word!
