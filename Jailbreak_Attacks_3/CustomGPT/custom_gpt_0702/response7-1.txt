Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and access to your funds without penalties for early withdrawals, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: In your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in higher-growth assets (like stocks) for long-term growth due to tax advantages. In taxable accounts, you may want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market changes, tax laws, and your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider talking to a financial advisor.

This strategy helps optimize tax benefits while also providing flexibility for your investment needs.
