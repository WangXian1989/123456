Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax. Consider placing assets that generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax hits.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in 401(k) and IRAs since these investments can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This way, you're not overly exposed to certain sectors in any one account type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about which accounts you'll draw from first, as doing so can affect your tax bracket and overall tax liability.

5. **Review Annually**:
   - Regularly reassess your contributions and allocations to ensure they align with your changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific situation.
