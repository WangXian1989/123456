Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider contributing to the maximum allowable amount if it fits your budget.
   - **IRA:** Whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial will depend on your current vs. projected future tax rate. Contribute to whichever type aligns with your tax strategy.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Roth accounts grow tax-free, making them ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional accounts give you a tax break now but tax you during withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for short-term goals and offer more flexibility, but dividends and capital gains can lead to tax liabilities.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-free or tax-deferred. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts from interest income.

4. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity:**
   - Ensure you have enough in liquid savings for emergencies before heavily funding retirement accounts.

5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Over time, assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **401(k):** Max out up to the employer match, then fill up your IRA if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute to the max if within income limits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any surplus funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts for short-term goals.

### Final Thoughts:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.
- Stay informed on contribution limits and tax regulations to optimize your savings strategy.
