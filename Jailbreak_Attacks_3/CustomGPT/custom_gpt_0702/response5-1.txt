Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget permits.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) contributions, consider your IRA options (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have additional funds after maxing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals.

### 3. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since these accounts are designed for long-term growth and benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks that pay qualified dividends or investments that generate capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance your investments as needed to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

### 5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**
   - Think about your future tax bracket when planning withdrawals. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth options now.

### Action Steps:
1. Determine your contributions to each account type based on your financial goals.
2. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.

This approach balances the benefits of each account type while aligning with your overall financial strategy.
