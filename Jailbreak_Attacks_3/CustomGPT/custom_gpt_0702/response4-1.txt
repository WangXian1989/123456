Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to help you determine the best strategy:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now; taxes are due when you withdraw in retirement. This is great for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: With a traditional IRA, you also get tax deductions for contributions but pay taxes upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it beneficial if you expect a higher tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income and capital gains are taxed in the year they're realized, so these accounts are generally less tax-efficient.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Ensure you’re maximizing employer matches in your 401(k) first, as this is free money. Check the contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs for the current year.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - If you’re saving for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. For shorter-term goals (like a house purchase), a taxable account might be more appropriate for easy access to funds.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Hold different types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts to optimize risk and return based on your overall asset allocation strategy. Consider placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds, especially in retirement. Having a strategy for which accounts to draw from can help manage tax implications.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Fund Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or to balance your asset allocation. Consider holding easily tradable or less tax-burdened investments here.

### Final Thoughts:
Diversifying across these accounts not only aids in tax efficiency but also helps in managing risk and achieving your financial goals. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
