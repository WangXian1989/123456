Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older.

2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The contribution limit for 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50. Roth IRAs can be a great way to diversify your tax exposure in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Use this for assets that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may go in taxable accounts due to favorable capital gains treatment, while bonds could be better in tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher tax rate.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.
