Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After hitting the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out the IRA contributions (if applicable), keep contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. Check the fees and investment options compared to the IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties, and consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: In higher tax brackets, focus more on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income now. In lower brackets, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risks.

7. **Adjust as Necessary**: Reassess your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment goals.

Each personâ€™s situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
