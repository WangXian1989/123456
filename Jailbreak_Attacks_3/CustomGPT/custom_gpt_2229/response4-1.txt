When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s essential to understand each account's features, tax implications, and your overall financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This reduces your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, typically in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After funding your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions (subject to income limits), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement under certain conditions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can then invest in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold for a profit.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Understanding your current and expected future tax brackets can help you decide whether to prioritize pre-tax accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA) or after-tax accounts (like a Roth IRA or taxable brokerage account).

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Generally, it's beneficial to hold higher-risk, higher-reward investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review your contributions and asset allocation to ensure that they align with your long-term objectives.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
