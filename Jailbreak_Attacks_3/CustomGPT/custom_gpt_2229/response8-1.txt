Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either a traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). IRAs can offer tax advantages that might benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after maxing out the IRA contribution limits, redirect additional savings into your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit allowed.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can be directed towards taxable accounts. These offer flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, though you will be subject to capital gains tax on any profits.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications for each account type:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes apply to dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider tax-efficient investments.

6. **Allocate According to Risk Tolerance**: Within each of these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, as they can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial plan.
