When considering the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement plans. Here are a few factors to think about:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA Types**: Determine whether a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA is better for your situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now with tax to pay upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: For investments outside of retirement accounts, be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Goals**: Align your retirement savings with your retirement age and lifestyle goals. Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be useful for more liquid investments.
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk. Consider how asset allocation might differ across taxable vs. tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in a liquid form before maximizing retirement accounts. This provides flexibility for unexpected expenses.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Have a plan for when and how you'll tap into various accounts in retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

In conclusion, a balanced approach that considers tax efficiency, investment goals, and liquidity will help you effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It might be best to consult with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your unique circumstances.
