Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is often preferred for younger investors due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but it depends on your income level and tax situation.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you're eligible, maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The tax-deferred growth can significantly enhance your retirement savings. Note that contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. These are flexible and do not have tax penalties for withdrawals, which can provide liquidity for short- and mid-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your asset allocation across all accounts. Keep in mind that different accounts contain different tax implications. For example, it may be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you invest, make sure to periodically rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, so holding investments for more than a year can be advantageous.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your unique situation.

It's essential to continually review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes over time.
