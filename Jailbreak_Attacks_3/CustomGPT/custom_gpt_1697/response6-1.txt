To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start with your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral and potential employer match (if available).
   - **Prioritize Roth Options**: If you anticipate a higher tax rate in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold higher growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize tax-free compounding.
   - **Income Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place dividend-paying stocks or bonds in taxable accounts to take advantage of preferential tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - **Balance Risk**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - **Plan for Retirement**: Strategize withdrawals based on tax implications, starting with taxable accounts, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

Implement these strategies based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation for the most efficient distribution of your investments.
