Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Consider maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed yearly on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term (retirement)**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified within each account.

### 5. **Withdrawals**
   - Plan for when and how you'll withdraw funds, considering tax implications.

### **Suggested Approach**
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match**.
2. **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA** (depending on income and tax situation).
3. **Utilize taxable accounts for additional investments or savings needs**.

### **Review Regularly**
Adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and goals. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
