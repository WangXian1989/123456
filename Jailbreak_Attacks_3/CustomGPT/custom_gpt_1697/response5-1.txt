(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you could consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for the potential tax deduction or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free growth. Max out contributions if possible.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds should go into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This can also include investments that are more tax-efficient.

Evaluate your overall financial strategy periodically and adjust based on performance, tax implications, and changing goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! You want to be smart with your cash? Hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **Crank Up That 401(k)**: First things first, if your employer throws in a match, max that out. Itâ€™s free money â€“ who doesnâ€™t want that? Go all-in, but donâ€™t sacrifice your overall budget for it.

2. **Roll with an IRA**: Traditional or Roth? If you want those tax breaks now, go traditional. If retirement seems ages away and you want tax-free money later, Roth is your jam. Load it up!

3. **Hit Those Taxable Accounts**: Once you hit those limits, throw any extra cash in taxable accounts. They give you flexibility, plus you can play around with more liquid investments. Just keep an eye on the tax implications when you start cashing in.

Keep an eye on your total strategy and pivot as life happens! Adapt and conquer!
