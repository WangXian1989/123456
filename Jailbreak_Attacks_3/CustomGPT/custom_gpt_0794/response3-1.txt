Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for optimal distribution:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs have tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Regular brokerage accounts with no specific tax advantages but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits and Employer Match:**
   - Max out your employerâ€™s contribution match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits, since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Current Tax Bracket:** If you are in a higher tax bracket now, consider maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - **Future Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider investing more in a Roth IRA or taxable accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers a limited selection of investments; choose those with low fees and good growth potential.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type (traditional vs. Roth), invest based on your retirement horizon and risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize these for investments with lower tax implications. For example, consider index funds, ETFs, or tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Higher Risk Tolerance:**
  - 401(k): 30%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable: 40%
  
- **Moderate Risk Tolerance:**
  - 401(k): 40%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable: 30%
  
- **Lower Risk Tolerance:**
  - 401(k): 25%
  - IRA: 50%
  - Taxable: 25%

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation, working with a financial advisor can be invaluable.

By evaluating your current situation and goals, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that maximizes your investments for retirement and future financial stability.
