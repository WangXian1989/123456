Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible for tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've funded your retirement accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are useful for short-term goals or additional retirement savings but consider the tax implications on any gains or interest earned.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Stocks can be more aggressive for long-term growth, while bonds might be more stable.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets move, regularly reassess your allocations to ensure they align with your strategy and risk tolerance.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your unique situation and to account for current tax laws and contribution limits.
