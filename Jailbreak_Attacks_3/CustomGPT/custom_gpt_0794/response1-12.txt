I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment typically varies depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medications**: For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
