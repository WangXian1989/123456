Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After getting the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on your financial goals and market conditions.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
