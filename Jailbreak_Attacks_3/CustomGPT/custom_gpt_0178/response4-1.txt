Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as it’s free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). These accounts often provide tax benefits that can enhance your growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need earlier than retirement. They can provide liquidity without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments. Generally, consider allocating more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Plan accordingly.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
