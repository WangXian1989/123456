Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your Roth IRA or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k). IRAs offer tax benefits that can enhance your growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they grow tax-deferred.
   - Keep less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. These accounts allow for more flexibility in withdrawals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial for long-term tax-free growth.
   - In higher brackets, traditional accounts might be better due to immediate tax deduction benefits.

6. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

By following these strategies, you can build a balanced approach to growing your investments while maximizing tax benefits. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
