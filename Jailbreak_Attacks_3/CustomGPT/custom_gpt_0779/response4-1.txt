Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how you might approach this distribution:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer match contributions first. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if your income permits; it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs), consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
