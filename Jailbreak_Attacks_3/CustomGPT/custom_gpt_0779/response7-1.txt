Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions:** After-maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s and can provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k):** If you still have the capacity to save more after maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and continue to contribute, especially if you are in a higher income bracket that would benefit from the tax deduction.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last:** Taxable accounts should be your final consideration. While they are flexible and can provide liquidity, they do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. You might want to focus on investing in these accounts for short-term goals or other savings once your tax-advantaged accounts are fully funded.

5. **Asset Allocation:** As you distribute your savings, also think about the asset allocation within each account. For retirement accounts, you can afford to take on more risk since the investment has a longer time horizon, while for taxable accounts, you may want to be more conservative due to potential taxes on capital gains.

6. **Revisit Your Strategy:** Periodically reassess your investments and distributions based on changes in your financial situations, such as increases in income, changes in tax laws, or changes in retirement goals.

It’s often best to consult a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your individual circumstances.
