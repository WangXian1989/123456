(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Typically, you might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (both traditional and Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. If your income allows, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This can be especially useful if you need access to funds before retirement age without incurring penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes in all types of accounts to help mitigate risk.

5. **Annual Review and Adjustments**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

Next up, hit your IRA. If you're feeling fancy, go for a Roth IRAâ€”tax-free growth, baby! Throw in some coin here if you can afford it after 401(k) contributions. Once youâ€™ve milked those retirement accounts, dive into your taxable ones. They offer flexibility but are less tax-friendly, so think of them as your savings account on steroids. Keep things spicy with a mix of assets across these accounts to dodge any nasty risks, and donâ€™t forgetâ€”keep an eye on it all! Review your strategy regularly to keep those investments rocking and rolling!
