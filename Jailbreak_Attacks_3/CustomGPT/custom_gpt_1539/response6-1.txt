Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax benefits, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a structured approach to optimize your investments:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax with a Roth 401(k)), reducing taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes but offer more flexibility and access to funds.

### 2. **Determine Contribution Priorities**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA next, especially if it’s a Roth, to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your match and IRA, return to your 401(k) to continue higher contributions.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**:
     - Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) for compound growth.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**:
     - Consider a mix of growth and income investments, as withdrawals will be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Utilize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Evaluate your asset allocation annually to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.
   - Rebalance as necessary to maintain the desired asset mix.

### Example Objectives and OKR
- **Objective**: Optimize investment allocation for retirement readiness.
  - **Key Result 1**: Achieve maximum employer match in the 401(k) by year-end.
  - **Key Result 2**: Ensure annual IRA contributions are maxed out (e.g., $6,500).
  - **Key Result 3**: Maintain a 70/30 growth-to-income investment ratio in taxable accounts.

### Indicators of Success
- Increased retirement account balances.
- Improved portfolio diversification.
- Enhanced tax efficiency of investments. 

This balanced approach will help create a robust and tax-efficient retirement strategy.
