Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. Understand Account Types

- **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Employers may offer matches, which is essentially "free money."
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Allocate enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can benefit from a Roth IRA.
3. **Back to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) to contribute more, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially for short-term goals or if you need flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications

- **Short-Term vs Long-Term**: Consider your time horizon. Long-term investments can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access sooner.
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan where you’ll withdraw funds from when you retire. Generally, it’s beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first, delaying tax-deferred accounts as long as possible.

### 4. Review and Adjust Regularly

- **Rebalance Portfolio**: Review your asset allocation regularly, ensuring it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Monitor Tax Changes**: Keep an eye on tax law changes that may affect your contribution limits or tax strategies.

### Example Allocation Strategy

- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: $6,500 annually (or more if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining disposable income after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Conclusion

This allocation strategy will create a tax-efficient portfolio while also allowing for flexibility based on your financial goals. Being strategic about where to place your money can significantly impact your long-term wealth accumulation. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
