Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (contributions taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free). Consider your tax bracket now versus expected retirement bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allow for flexible withdrawals without penalties, but investment gains are subject to capital gains tax. Useful for investments that produce regular income or may be needed before retirement.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Debt Management:** Pay down high-interest debts before allocating a large portion to these accounts.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved for emergencies.

### 3. **Strategic Allocation:**
   - **Max Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts to take advantage of tax benefits:
     - For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus a catch-up contribution if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. The risk level and investment choice might vary – for instance, higher-risk investments may go into Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Account Strategy:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) that generate minimal taxable distributions.
   - **Loss Harvesting:** Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains, if applicable.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
If your situation is complex, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

### Example Distribution Strategy (Hypothetical):
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get 100% employer match, max out contributions if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, considering Roth vs. traditional based on tax expectations.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds in low-turnover, tax-efficient funds or stocks.

By following these steps, you'll be on a path to optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
