Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - **Retirement Timing**: Determine when you plan to retire. This affects how aggressively you should invest.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in accessible accounts for emergencies.

### 2. Understand Account Features
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, may include matching contributions and higher contribution limits. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages (tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but capital gains tax applies to profits. Offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 3. Determine Contribution Priorities
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. Diversification and Risk Management
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. Monitor and Adjust
   - **Review Annually**: Assess your financial situation, market conditions, and adjust contributions and investment strategies as needed.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from each account will impact your taxes in retirement.

### OKR Example
- **Objective**: Optimize portfolio distribution for retirement savings.
  - **Key Result 1**: Achieve full employer match in 401(k) within the next year.
  - **Key Result 2**: Contribute the maximum allowable to an IRA each year.
  - **Key Result 3**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio with a risk level appropriate for a 10-year retirement horizon.

### Indicators of Success
- Contribution rates to each account.
- Growth of investments measured against benchmarks.
- Overall portfolio performance relative to risk-adjusted returns.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
