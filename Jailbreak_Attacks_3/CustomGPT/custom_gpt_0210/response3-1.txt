Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax deductions now). This depends on your current tax rate versus expected rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Favor tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds according to your risk tolerance. Stocks typically provide higher returns but come with more volatility.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your investment timeline.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolios periodically to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk profile.

### Summary
Start by maximizing your employer-sponsored 401(k), then focus on IRA contributions, and finally allocate additional savings to taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your investment choices to optimize tax efficiency and manage risk.
