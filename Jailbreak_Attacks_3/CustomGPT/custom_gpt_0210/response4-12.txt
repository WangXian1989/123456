I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from vitamins and supplements, but consult a healthcare provider first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and tests can help track liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
