To distribute your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs, to reduce capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified investment portfolio across all accounts by considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix as markets fluctuate.

5. **Long-Term Planning**:
   - Think about your future tax situation in retirement when deciding how much to contribute to each account type.

By balancing tax efficiency, diversification, and contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you'll set a solid foundation for long-term growth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
