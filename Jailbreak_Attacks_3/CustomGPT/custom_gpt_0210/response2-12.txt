I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems that you might discuss with a healthcare professional:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Follow a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis C).
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: 
   - Supplements for liver health (discuss these with a doctor).

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
