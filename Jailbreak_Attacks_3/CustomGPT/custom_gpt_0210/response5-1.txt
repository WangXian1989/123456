To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income and grow tax-deferred. Focus on this until the match is met.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: IRAs offer tax advantages. Choose a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity. This is ideal for goals outside retirement (like buying a home).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Optimize your investment strategy based on risk tolerance and goals. Typically, stock-heavy investments are better suited for tax-deferred accounts, while bonds may be more appropriate for taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can enhance tax efficiency and grow your wealth more effectively over time.
