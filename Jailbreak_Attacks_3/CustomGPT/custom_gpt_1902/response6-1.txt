To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Always contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Investment Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative investments tailored to your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Future Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications. Use taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

These strategies will help you optimize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
