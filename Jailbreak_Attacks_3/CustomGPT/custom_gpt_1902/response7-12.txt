I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt. Include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and improves liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**:
   - Completely abstaining from alcohol can significantly reduce liver strain.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Keep up with regular check-ups and tests as recommended by your doctor to monitor liver health.

5. **Potential Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be discussed.

Always consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action specific to your condition.
