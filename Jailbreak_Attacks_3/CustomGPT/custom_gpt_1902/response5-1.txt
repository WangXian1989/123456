Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Good for younger savers expecting higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term goals and investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance, ensuring a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of market changes.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain some savings in a taxable account for unexpected expenses, separate from your retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20% (maximize employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts:** The remainder based on liquidity needs.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your distribution strategy to fit your personal circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
