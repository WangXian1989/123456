To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Debt Considerations**:
   - Focus on paying off high-interest debt before aggressively funding accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) or those expected to appreciate significantly (e.g., stocks).
   - Keep lower-growth investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Plan contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets. 

Diversifying your contributions based on these factors can optimize growth and minimize taxes in the long run. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
