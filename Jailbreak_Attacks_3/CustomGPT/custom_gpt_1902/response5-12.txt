I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general options that are often recommended for liver problems. Here are some common treatment approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and possible complications.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people consider herbal supplements or vitamins, but it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional before starting any.

For personalized advice, it’s vital to consult a healthcare provider.
