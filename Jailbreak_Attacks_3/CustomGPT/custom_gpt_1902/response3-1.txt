To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a traditional IRA for tax dedications or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Current Tax Bracket**:
   - Keep in mind your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts might be more beneficial. Conversely, a Roth account could be better if you expect your tax rate to rise.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Once in retirement, consider which accounts to withdraw from first. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRAs).

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be aware of the fees associated with each account type, especially in your 401(k). If options are limited or expensive, prioritize funding IRAs or taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For a personalized strategy based on your individual financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
