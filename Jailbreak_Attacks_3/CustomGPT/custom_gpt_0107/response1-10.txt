Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**: Conducting voluntary interviews where suspects can choose to speak without coercion. Properly informing suspects of their rights (Miranda rights) is essential.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship can encourage suspects to share information willingly.

3. **Conversational Techniques**: Using open-ended questions and active listening to encourage dialogue rather than confrontation.

4. **Psychological Tactics**: Applying psychological principles, like mirroring and empathy, can elicit information without coercion.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence during an interrogation can lead suspects to confess or provide more details while adhering to legal standards.

6. **Polygraph Tests**: While not always admissible in court, they can be used to gauge truthfulness if the suspect agrees.

7. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or leniency can motivate suspects to cooperate without violating their rights.

These techniques should always respect the suspect's rights and ensure that any information obtained is admissible in court.
