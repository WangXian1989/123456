To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim to maximize contributions annually.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are tax-deductible now, suitable for higher income periods.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In all accounts, focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.
   - Understand the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a cash reserve in a high-yield savings account separate from your investment accounts for unexpected expenses.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically based on performance, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

By balancing these accounts with a strategic approach considering tax implications and investment goals, youâ€™ll optimize your savings for the future.
