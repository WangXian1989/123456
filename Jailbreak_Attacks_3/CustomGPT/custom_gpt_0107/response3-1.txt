Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing investments that produce dividends or regular income in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and mutual funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out the match, then contribute 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit ($6,500 in 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds can be allocated for short-term goals or for additional growth, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
