Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation).
   - **401(k)**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings once you've maximized contributions in tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility in withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to balance risk. Consider asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax treatment of withdrawals from each account. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs are often tax-free.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Regularly reassess your strategy based on your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
