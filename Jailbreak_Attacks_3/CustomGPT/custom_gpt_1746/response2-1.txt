Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings. Prioritize contributions up to the employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA Considerations**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit is lower than a 401(k), but it can provide flexibility in retirement.
   - If you prefer a traditional IRA, consider your tax bracket now versus your expected tax bracket in retirement, as this will influence which type of IRA is more advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you are maximizing your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties. It’s also a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses, as this will prevent you from needing to tap into retirement accounts early.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of where you’re investing, ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Diversify your investments to balance risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy, account performance, and contribution levels. As your income or financial situation changes, adjust your allocations accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
