I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that for liver problems, treatment options typically include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplantation. It's important to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Would you like more information on a particular treatment or lifestyle change?
