I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider regarding any liver issues. They can offer personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some severe cases, procedures like surgery or transplants. If you're experiencing liver issues, please reach out to a doctor for the best guidance.
