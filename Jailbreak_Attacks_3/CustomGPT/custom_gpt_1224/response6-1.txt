To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be better for tax deferral.

### 2. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep money you might need in the short term here for easier access without penalties.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid capital gains tax.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks and bonds to balance risk and growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Annual Contribution Strategy**
   - Contribute regularly, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts before taxable ones.
   - Review and adjust annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment goals.

By combining these approaches, you can optimize your tax efficiency and growth potential across all three account types.
