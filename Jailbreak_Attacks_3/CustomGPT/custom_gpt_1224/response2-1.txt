To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize this for higher contributions since 401(k)s often have high contribution limits and may include employer matching. Focus on tax-deferred investments.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in funds with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and keep longer-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider holding more volatile or higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as these can benefit most from tax-deferred growth, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your target allocation and manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, considering taxes, timing, and your overall cash flow needs.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your individual financial situation and goals.

This approach can help maximize growth while minimizing taxes on your investments.
