Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies. Typically, aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for goals within the next few years. Consider using them for investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

5. **Diversify**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk effectively.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
