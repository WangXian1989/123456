Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum limit if you can. Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) for tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for additional savings. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation based on market changes and your evolving financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
