Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a guideline to help you:

1. **Maximize Your 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full company match, if available—this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you need tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be more suitable.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - Investments in taxable accounts can be held long-term for favorable capital gains treatment.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Equity investments could be placed in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.
   - Fixed income or other tax-inefficient investments might be better suited for your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and rebalance based on your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and ensures you are prepared for future financial needs.
