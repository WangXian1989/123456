Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here’s an effective approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
- **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Suitable for high-income years as you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Generate capital gains and dividends taxed at your current rate. Use for short-term savings or goals.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate risk based on how comfortable you are with market fluctuations. Younger investors might lean more toward stocks, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds.
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Stocks in retirement accounts (to benefit from tax deferral) and bonds in taxable accounts (to manage taxes efficiently).

### 4. Regular Reassessment
- **Periodic Review**: Adjust your contributions based on performance, changes in income, and evolving financial goals.

### 5. Seek Professional Guidance
- **Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting an advisor for personalized strategies aligned with your specific situation.

By following this approach, you can optimize your investments across all account types.
