The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can afford it, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you have a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible based on your income and other criteria, offering immediate tax benefits.
   - If you prefer tax-free growth, consider a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income limits. Contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are also tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or dividend income, as long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - These accounts offer more flexibility, such as access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Debt and Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of expenses) before overly concentrating on retirement accounts.
   - Pay off high-interest debt before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation and Diversification**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider how the different accounts will be taxed upon withdrawal and plan your asset allocation accordingly (e.g., more bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, more stocks in taxable accounts for lower capital gains).

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
