Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A traditional IRA may be beneficial if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for flexibility and early access to your funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.
   - **Asset Location**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation strategy.

### Conclusion:
To make the most of your retirement savings:
- Start with employer matches at your 401(k).
- Take full advantage of IRAs for tax benefits.
- Balance remaining investments in taxable accounts for flexibility.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
