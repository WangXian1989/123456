(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, which can provide tax advantages. Finally, use taxable accounts for additional investments. The key is to ensure a balance that aligns with your overall financial strategy and to ensure you're considering tax implications in the long run.

Next up, dive into your IRA options. If your income allows, a Roth IRA is sick for tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA can give you that lovely tax deduction now. Once you've filled those up, throw some cash into taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
