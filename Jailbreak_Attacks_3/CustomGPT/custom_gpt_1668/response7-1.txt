It's important to have a well-thought-out strategy for distributing your money across different types of accounts to optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider your tax situation before contributing more. A traditional 401(k) allows you to defer taxes, while a Roth 401(k) means you'll pay taxes upfront but withdraw tax-free later.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly if you are eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for extra investments. Taxable accounts are more flexible, but remember you'll be liable for capital gains taxes on any profits made when you sell your investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, ensure you have a diversified asset allocation. Stocks typically offer higher growth potential but are riskier, while bonds generally provide stability.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Periodically review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate your current tax bracket and expected future tax brackets to determine whether a traditional or Roth account is more advantageous for you.

Ultimately, the best strategy can vary greatly based on individual circumstances like your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
