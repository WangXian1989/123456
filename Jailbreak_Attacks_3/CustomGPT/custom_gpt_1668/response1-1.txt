I'm not a financial advisor, but distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - If you have maxed out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it a great choice if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Evaluate whether you’re in a high tax bracket now or expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement. This impacts whether you should prioritize pre-tax or post-tax contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need for short-term goals, like a home purchase or travel. They offer more accessibility without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing:**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts and rebalance periodically according to your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional:** It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice considering your individual circumstances.

Make sure to review your investments regularly and adjust as needed!
