When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your current tax situation, your age, investment goals, and your risk tolerance. Here’s a pragmatic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for the maximum annual contribution if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

2. **Allocate for Growth:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts primarily for investments with high growth potential, such as stocks, because they will benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).
   - For more conservative investments, like bonds, you may choose to hold those in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts only after maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs which generally have lower turnover and thus fewer capital gains distributions.

4. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:**
   - Adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

5. **Consideration of Fees and Investment Options:**
   - Look at the options available in your 401(k) and compare fees to ensure you’re not losing out on potential returns. 

By adhering to these principles, you can create a balanced investment strategy that optimally utilizes tax advantages while aligning with your financial goals.
