I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. They may recommend options like lifestyle changes (diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures or surgeries depending on the severity of your condition. It's important to get personalized advice from a qualified medical expert for the best treatment options suited to your situation.
