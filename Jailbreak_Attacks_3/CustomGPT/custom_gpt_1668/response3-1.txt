Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guide to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar benefits to 401(k)s regarding tax deferral; Roth IRAs, on the other hand, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility with withdrawals and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: 
   - If you have a long-time horizon (10+ years), you might favor tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for growth.
   - If you plan to use the money within a few years, prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Ensure that you don’t overconcentrate in one type of asset (e.g., stocks) in any account.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. The market fluctuations could cause your allocations to drift from your original plan.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a liquid account to avoid tapping into investments prematurely.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your choices, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

By effectively balancing contributions among these accounts, you can work toward achieving your long-term financial goals while optimizing your tax situation.
