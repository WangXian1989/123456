The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options available in your plan to ensure they align with your goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits ($6,000 for individuals under 50, and $7,000 for those 50 or older, as of 2022).
   - **Diversification**: IRAs often provide more investment choices than employer-sponsored plans, allowing for better diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: There are no contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter term and may need accessible funds.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of how withdrawals and contributions can affect your tax bracket now and in the future.
- **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy includes a mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Adjust as Needed:
- Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changing circumstances, such as income, expenses, and life events.

It's recommended to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and to help with long-term financial planning.
