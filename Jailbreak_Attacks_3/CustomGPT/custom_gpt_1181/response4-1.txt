When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the ideal strategy depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some tips to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to obtain the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on them until you withdraw in retirement. However, be aware of the potential for higher taxes in retirement depending on your tax bracket.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, benefiting those who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep money for short-term goals or expenses in taxable accounts since these accounts offer flexibility and are not subject to early withdrawal penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these retirement accounts, as accessing funds from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

4. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - Typically, place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow without incurring taxes until withdrawal.
   - Consider holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax burdens.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Strategically withdrawing from different accounts (such as 401(k), IRAs, and taxable accounts) can help you manage your tax bracket effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your investment and distribution strategy to align with changing goals, income levels, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation. Always consider how each account type aligns with your long-term financial goals.
