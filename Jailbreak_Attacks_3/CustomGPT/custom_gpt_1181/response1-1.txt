When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (whether Roth or Traditional) if you qualify. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: If you have already maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use your taxable accounts for extra savings. While these accounts don’t offer the same tax benefits, they provide flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how you want to allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider putting more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where you won’t face taxes on gains until you withdraw.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio’s asset allocation. As you contribute, rebalance your holdings to ensure you maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) to minimize tax impact.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation!
