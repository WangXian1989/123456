When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize increasing your contribution up to the annual limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The choice between these depends on your current tax situation and anticipated future tax rates.

2. **Effectively Utilize Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, that produce fewer taxable events. This can help mitigate tax liabilities.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where they can grow without immediate tax impact) and interest-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize your overall tax situation.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to spread risk. Different account types may offer distinct investment options that can complement each other.

By considering these points, you can create a balanced and strategically advantageous approach to your investments!
