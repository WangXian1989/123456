The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you consider how to allocate your money:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or Roth IRA if you're eligible. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages as your 401(k) or IRA, so it's often wise to hold investments that yield higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and to hold investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk. Different accounts may have different investment options, so take advantage of that.

5. **Age and Goal Consideration**: Your age, risk tolerance, and whether you're saving for retirement or a specific goal (like buying a house) can impact how you distribute funds. Generally, the further you are from retirement, the more aggressive you can be with your investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and be sure to rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment mix across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you want personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can take into account your unique circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the strategy that works best for you will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and preferences.
