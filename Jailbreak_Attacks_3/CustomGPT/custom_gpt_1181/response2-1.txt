When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to take into account several factors including your current financial situation, long-term goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money and helps you build your retirement savings faster.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA after contributing enough to get any employer match. IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, you can utilize taxable accounts for additional investing. This is particularly useful if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age or if you want to invest in strategies not allowed within tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA** contributions may also offer a tax deduction, but similar tax treatment applies upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts will result in taxes on dividends and capital gains, so consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) there.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes and sectors within all accounts. This helps reduce risk and improve potential returns.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Long-term Strategy**: Tailor your contributions based on your retirement timeline. Younger investors might favor growth investments, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability and income.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial planner for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

By thoughtfully distributing your money and considering these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
