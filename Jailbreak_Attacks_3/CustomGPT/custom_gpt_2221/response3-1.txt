Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. They can be a good option once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like ETFs or index funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have diversified investments across all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Consider the tax impacts of selling investments in taxable accounts versus withdrawing money from retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Suggested Allocation Example:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (max out employer match)
- **IRA (or Roth IRA)**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% (once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out)

Adjust percentages based on your individual circumstances, such as age and retirement timeline. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
