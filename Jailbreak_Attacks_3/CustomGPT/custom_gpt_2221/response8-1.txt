Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and growth. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Debt Management**:
   - Prioritize paying off high-interest debt before investing heavily in these accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they allow for tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-producing assets (like bonds or REITs) to keep your tax burden lower.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals by considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
