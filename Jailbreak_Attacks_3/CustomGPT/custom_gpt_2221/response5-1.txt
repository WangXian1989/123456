Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, then maximize your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use them for investments that generate long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact. Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and perhaps real estate.

### 4. **Retirement Horizon:**
   - If you have many years until retirement, prioritize growth investments (stocks). If close to retirement, consider more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.
