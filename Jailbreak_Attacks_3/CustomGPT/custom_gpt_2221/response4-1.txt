Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Consider your current vs. future tax rate.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Interest and short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings in a taxable account for emergencies before heavily investing.

### 4. **Investment Timeline**
   - If youâ€™re younger (more than 10 years from retirement), you might lean more into stocks (higher growth potential) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift focus to preserving capital, considering bonds or stable investments.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Hold investments with high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Allocation for a Balanced Approach
1. **401(k)**: up to employer match + additional if you have capacity.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 per year, $7,500 if 50+).
3. **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds for flexibility and withdrawal needs.

### Conclusion
Review these strategies regularly and adjust them based on changes in your financial situation and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
