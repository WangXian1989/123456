The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and potential higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages, but contributions may be limited. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments but are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match:** 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially “free money.”

3. **Take Advantage of Tax Benefits:**
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may be preferable if you seek immediate tax deductions.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) may reduce your tax burden. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. For instance, you might hold more aggressive assets (like stocks) in your Roth IRA where gains are tax-free, while keeping more conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

6. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Consider your liquidity needs. Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, which can be important for short-term goals.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your investments and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexities of investing and taxation, working with a financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy that aligns with your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best approach is to assess your overall financial picture and develop a strategy that takes into account your specific goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications.
