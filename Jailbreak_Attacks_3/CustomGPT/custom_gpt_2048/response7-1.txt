Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions and company match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide you with tax deductions now.

2. **Investment Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA Investments**: Use these tax-advantaged accounts for investments that you expect to appreciate significantly or that generate a lot of taxable income (such as bonds). This way, you defer taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they generally have lower tax rates. You can also consider holding cash or fixed-income securities in taxable accounts to avoid high tax burdens from bond interest.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Your contribution strategy can change based on your current and expected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio remains balanced across all accounts. The investment strategy should be consistent, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Stay Flexible**:
   - As your financial situation and market conditions change, periodically reassess your distribution strategy and adjust your contributions accordingly. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best approach for your unique situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can provide tailored advice based on your full financial picture.

Overall, a well-thought-out distribution amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly benefit your long-term financial health.
