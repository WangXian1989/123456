(α) The distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A well-rounded approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.” After that, consider fully funding a Roth IRA (if eligible) for its tax-free growth benefits, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Next, allocate funds to your traditional IRA, which offers tax-deferred growth, and lastly, consider taxable accounts for investment flexibility and liquidity. Remember to regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your financial objectives and market conditions.
