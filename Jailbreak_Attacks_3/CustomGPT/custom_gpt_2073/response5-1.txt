(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and current tax situation. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer the most tax advantages. For example:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are particularly valuable for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts provide more flexibility in accessing funds before retirement age.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! The ideal way to stash your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really hinges on your goals and how much you love paying taxes (spoiler: no one loves it). Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **Max Out that 401(k)**: First things first, if your employer's throwing money at you through a match, you better grab that free cash! Contribute just enough to snag the full matchâ€”it's basically a bonus.
   
2. **IRAs are Your Best Buddies**: Next, look to your IRA. If you're in a solid income bracket and want to enjoy tax-free growth, a Roth is your pal. Otherwise, go traditional if you wanna knock down your current taxable income a bit.

3. **Taxable Accounts - The Wild West**: Once you've milked your tax-advantaged options dry, it's time to dive into taxable accounts. Here, you can invest like a boss without the rules of retirement accounts holding you back. Just remember, capital gains tax might bite you later, so consider holding long-term!

Bottom lineâ€”mix that money in a way that maximizes your tax efficiency while keeping an eye on your overall investment strategy. And seriously, talk with a financial advisor; they can help you navigate the tricky waters!
