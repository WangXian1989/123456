The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out the contribution to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions (depending on income), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth. If eligible, consider maximizing IRA contributions, choosing between Traditional and Roth based on your current tax rate versus expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but remember to account for capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell assets.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified and fit your risk tolerance. Consider asset location strategies to enhance tax efficiencyâ€”puting bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and equities in taxable accounts for potential long-term capital gains tax benefits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your goals and market changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
