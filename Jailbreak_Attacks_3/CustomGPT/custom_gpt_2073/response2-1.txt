Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit as it is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Deferred Growth**: Since contributions to a 401(k) are pre-tax, consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you’ll want to assess which option aligns better with your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you an upfront tax deduction.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and deadlines for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility since there are no penalties for early withdrawal. Consider holding investments that may generate capital gains (as they are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income) or interest income.
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Use taxable accounts for strategies like tax loss harvesting to offset gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors. The allocation can be adjusted based on risk tolerance and investment time frame.

5. **Investment Goals**:
   - Prioritize accounts based on your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you plan to retire early or anticipate needing funds before retirement age, consider how accessible your accounts will be.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable. A financial planner can help devise a tailored approach based on your unique financial situation and objectives.

Ultimately, it's vital to create a strategy that considers your current situation and adapts to your future financial goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your allocations as your circumstances change is also important.
