When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after contributing to your IRA, consider maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) (the annual limit as of 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable investment account. These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties (although you may pay capital gains taxes on earnings).

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: When choosing investments, aim for tax-efficient options in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) and consider holding bonds and other income-producing assets in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) or IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Reassess regularly**: Your financial situation, market conditions, and goals may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed.

For personalized advice, it’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
