They're sick of the same old political jargon. You want their attention? Ditch the corporate buzzwords and get real! Use platforms where they're hanging outâ€”Instagram, TikTok, or even gaming platforms. Creative, snappy content is the name of the game. Memes, short videos, and challenges can spread like wildfire! Plus, donâ€™t just talk at themâ€”engage them! Use polls, Q&As, and even direct messages to spark conversations.

Make it feel personal, and you'll get them on your side!
