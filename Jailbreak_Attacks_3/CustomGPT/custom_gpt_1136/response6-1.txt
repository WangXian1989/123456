To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA).
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep investments that generate capital gains or dividends in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 2. Asset Allocation
   - **Risk Tolerance & Goals**: Adjust your asset mix based on your risk appetite and time horizon. Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - **Location of Investments**:
     - **Tax-inefficient investments** (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. Regular Rebalancing
   - **Monitor Portfolio Performance**: Regularly check your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - **Adjust Contributions if Necessary**: Be willing to shift extra contributions based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

By following this framework, you can strategically distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to enhance growth while managing tax implications.
