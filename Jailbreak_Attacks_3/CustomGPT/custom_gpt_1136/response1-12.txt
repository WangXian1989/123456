I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for your liver problem. They can provide tailored advice based on your condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgery. Make sure to get a proper diagnosis and follow your doctor's recommendations!
