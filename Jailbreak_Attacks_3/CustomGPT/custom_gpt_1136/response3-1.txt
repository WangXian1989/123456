Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your IRAs (both traditional and Roth) after the 401(k) match. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, especially if youâ€™re planning to access these funds before retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon within each account type. Generally, higher-risk investments can be more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts for the long term.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. For instance, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to delay withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts until necessary.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor might be helpful for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
