To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - Max out your IRA contributions, considering whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, hold more tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) here since taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar approachâ€”focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this account for tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Invest for growth in accounts for long-term goals (retirement) and more conservatively in accounts for near-term goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Tax Awareness**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in your taxable accounts, aiming to minimize short-term capital gains.

Regularly reviewing your investment strategy with a financial advisor can help tailor your approach to your specific financial situation.
