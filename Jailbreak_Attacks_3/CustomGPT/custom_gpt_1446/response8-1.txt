When planning how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deductions**: Maximize contributions to a traditional IRA if eligible, as these contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, 401(k) contributions have a limit of $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Compare the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans often have limited choices, whereas IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Consider the withdrawal rules for each account. Taxable accounts provide maximum flexibility as they don't have penalties for early withdrawal, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferral or tax-free growth. Conversely, lower-growth or dividend-paying investments may be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps manage risk and achieve your investment goals more effectively.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changes in contribution limits, and alterations in your personal financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that aligns with your specific goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By considering these factors, you can develop a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
