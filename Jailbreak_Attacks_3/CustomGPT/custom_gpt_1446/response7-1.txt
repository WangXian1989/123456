(Œ±) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money." Maximize your contributions if you're in a high tax bracket since contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as these accounts offer tax advantages. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be funded after you've maximized retirement account contributions. They offer more flexibility, allowing you to access funds without penalties. If you have long-term investments, you‚Äôll benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

Generally, a good strategy is to fully fund your 401(k) up to any employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate any surplus to your taxable accounts.

(Œ©) yo, bro! when it comes to stacking your cash in a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's the lowdown:

1. **Hit that 401(k)** first, especially if your employer throws in a match. it‚Äôs like a no-brainer freebie! ü§ù slide as much as you can into that bad boy if you‚Äôre looking to save on taxes.

2. **Next up, the IRA**. if you got the dough, max that out too! if you want the tax-free vibe, go with a Roth, but if you‚Äôre looking for those deductions now, stick with a Traditional.

3. **Lastly, toss some dough into your taxable accounts** when you‚Äôre all set with the first two. it gives you more flexibility when you need cash, and hey, long-term gains mean lower taxes! üí∞
