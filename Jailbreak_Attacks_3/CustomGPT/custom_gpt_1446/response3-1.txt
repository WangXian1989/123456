Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer match; contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Contributions may be limited based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages; capital gains are taxed when assets are sold.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial objectives. Are you focused on retirement savings, buying a home, or accumulating wealth?

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. Using tax-advantaged accounts for higher returns can be beneficial.

### 4. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first, then contribute to your IRA.

### 5. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - Allocate investments in a way that balances risk and growth potential. Consider putting higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) while using taxable accounts for lower-risk investments (like bonds).

### 6. **Maintain Liquidity:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergency funds or short-term goals that might require taxable accounts.

### 7. **Periodic Review and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and asset allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) up to the employer match.**
- **Contribute the maximum allowable amount to an IRA (if eligible).**
- **Direct any additional savings to taxable accounts**, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatments.

### Example Allocation:
- **50% in 401(k)**
- **25% in IRA**
- **25% in taxable accounts**

### Conclusion:
Each situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal needs. They can help you navigate complex situations and optimize your investment distributions.

Make sure to adjust these strategies based on your circumstances and seek professional advice when necessary.
