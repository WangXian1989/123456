When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the features and benefits of each account type. Here’s a structured approach to optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan; contributions may reduce your taxable income. Often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; contributions can be tax-deductible depending on your income and filing status.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility with withdrawals; however, investment gains are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your current tax situation and future expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings beyond retirement accounts, especially if you've maxed out contributions to 401(k) and IRA.

### 3. Allocate Investments:
   - **401(k)**: Invest primarily in tax-advantaged growth assets (stocks, mutual funds) due to the tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax strategy (Roth vs. Traditional), select growth-oriented assets for future tax minimization.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 4. Monitor & Adjust:
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly assess your investment performance to ensure alignment with your retirement goals.
   - **Rebalance**: Adjust asset allocation as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

These strategies will help you effectively distribute your investments across various accounts with the goal of maximizing tax efficiency and retirement savings. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
