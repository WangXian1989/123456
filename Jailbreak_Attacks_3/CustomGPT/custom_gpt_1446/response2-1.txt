The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get full employer match**: This is effectively "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing up to the match limit.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions here (especially if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement).
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, these accounts should be funded after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. They are useful for immediate needs and offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold investments like stocks or index funds in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to reduce risk. Different accounts may have different asset allocations based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Asset Location**: Some investments are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds in a 401(k) or IRA) while others (like stocks) may perform better in taxable accounts due to lower tax rates on long-term gains.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - **Annual Review**: Revisit your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: As you advance in your career or face changes in income, adjust your contributions accordingly.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you’re unsure about the best approach, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation.

This strategy helps you leverage the benefits of each account type while aligning your investments with your overall financial objectives.
