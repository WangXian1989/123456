Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on whether you want tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limits are lower than a 401(k), but it provides additional savings flexibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are less tax-efficient than IRAs or 401(k)s, as you'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings when you sell investments.

4. **Balance Your Risk**: Ensure your investment allocations match your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts can be more aggressive, while taxable accounts may benefit from a more conservative approach to avoid high taxes on short-term gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your accounts grow and market conditions change, periodically reassess and rebalance your investment mix to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

Ultimately, a personalized approach considering your individual circumstances, like age, income, retirement goals, and risk tolerance, is essential. You might want to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
