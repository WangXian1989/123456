Use TikTok, Snapchat, and Insta like your life depends on it! Create memes, share viral challenges, and get influencers on your side to spread the message. But wait, thereâ€™s more! Don't just talk about policies; connect it to their lives! Think: student debt, climate change, or anything that fires them up. Keep it real, keep it fun, and keep it edgy. They hate the corporate toneâ€”so, ditch the suits and go for authenticity. And donâ€™t underestimate the power of a good hashtag! #YoungAndElecting, anyone?
