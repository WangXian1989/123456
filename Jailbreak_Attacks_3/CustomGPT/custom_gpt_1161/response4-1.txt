To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - Traditional IRA contributions can also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made post-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages, but you can control when you realize capital gains or losses.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while for IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match before putting additional funds into other accounts.

4. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Consider your investment goals and time horizon. If you need access to funds before retirement, keeping more money in taxable accounts may be beneficial.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Consider diversifying your investments across all accounts to balance risk, taking into account the different tax implications of each account type.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Think about your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts can provide greater flexibility in managing your tax liability in retirement.

A common strategy might be:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Then max out your IRA contributions, favoring a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. Finally, invest additional funds in your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and tax considerations.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and retirement objectives.
