(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Typically, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to any employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the match limit, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Lastly, any additional funds can be allocated to a taxable investment account, which provides more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.
