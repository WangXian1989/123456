The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if you are in a higher tax bracket. This can lower your taxable income. Additionally, if your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option, you could consider that for tax-free growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free. Keep in mind the income limits for Roth IRA contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider opening a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for investing and withdrawing funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Location**: Place investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Lower income-generating investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts since they may be taxed at lower rates.

6. **Investment Time Horizon**: Consider the time frame for your financial goals. Longer-term investments can benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals might warrant a taxable account for easier access.

7. **Regular Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation and account performance. Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

Consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
