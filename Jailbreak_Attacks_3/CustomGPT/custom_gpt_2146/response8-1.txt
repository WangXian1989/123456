Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - If your current tax rate is lower than expected in retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA contributions, continue putting money into your 401(k) until you reach its contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for more flexible access (though these may be subject to capital gains taxes).

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your goals and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
