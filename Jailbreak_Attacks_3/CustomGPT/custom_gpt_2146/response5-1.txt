To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this first for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out any match in your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and contributions limits.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that generate high taxable income.
   - Keep investments that grow over time (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

4. **Diversification**: Choose a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
