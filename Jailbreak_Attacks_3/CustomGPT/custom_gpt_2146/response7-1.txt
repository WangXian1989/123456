To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax on sales and dividends, but you have more flexibility.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or municipal bonds) and higher-growth, less tax-efficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For long-term goals, focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. In taxable accounts, consider a mix of growth and income-generating assets, depending on your needs.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to maintain your target distribution among accounts based on market conditions and life changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized guidance, particularly if you have complex financial situations or goals.

By employing these strategies, you can build a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
