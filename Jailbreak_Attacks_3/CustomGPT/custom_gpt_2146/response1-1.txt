Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment options. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might want to access before retirement age, such as stocks or mutual funds. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth; consider your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay attention to tax implications of dividends and capital gains.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your contributions and allocations periodically to ensure they align with your retirement goals and market changes.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
