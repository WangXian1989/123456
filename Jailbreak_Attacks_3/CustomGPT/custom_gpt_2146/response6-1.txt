Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Usually, this is free money and a great way to start.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate lower taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Keep a separate liquidity reserve outside these accounts for emergencies, about 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

### 4. **Balance for Growth vs. Safety**
   - Diversify investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Regular Reassessments**
   - Review your allocation annually and adjust based on market conditions and your changing financial situation.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Prioritize contributions to accounts with employer matches.**
- **Choose investment vehicles based on your tax situation.**
- **Keep liquidity needs in mind.**
- **Diversify appropriately to mitigate risks.**
