Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This plan often has pre-tax benefits that lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need before retirement or for investment flexibility. These accounts can also be useful for long-term goals that may not fit neatly into retirement accounts.

5. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This can help manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**: Evaluate the fees associated with each account and the investment options available, as these can impact your overall returns.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation changes or as retirement nears.
