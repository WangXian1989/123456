Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts after securing your 401(k) match.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows you more flexibility for withdrawals and needs not tied to retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term tax growth, and lower-risk assets (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances can vary widely, so consulting with a professional may provide tailored strategies suited to your situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 25%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 25%

Adjust this based on your specific goals and financial situation.
