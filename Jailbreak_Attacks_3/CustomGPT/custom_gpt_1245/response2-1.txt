Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible. This reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you're eligible, max out contributions to your IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover and for tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified. Consider blending different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation. This is important as market movements can skew your desired distribution.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Keep a separate emergency fund, ideally in a high-yield savings account.

### 6. **Long-Term Goals:**
   - Align your investments with your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and time horizons. 

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially considering your unique financial situation and goals.
