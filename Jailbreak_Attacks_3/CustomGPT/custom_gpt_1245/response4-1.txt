Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Roth or Traditional IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

3. **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility for short-term goals and liquidity.

4. **Investment Choices**: In tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) to maximize tax benefits. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure diversified investments across all accounts. This can help manage risk and potential returns.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.
