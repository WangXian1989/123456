To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short- to Medium-Term Needs**: Allocate funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible (for 2024, the limit is $23,000 if under 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax) based on your tax situation. The annual limit for 2024 is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax burdens (e.g., index funds or ETFs) or for assets you plan to hold long-term to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - **Investment Choices**: Use your 401(k) for a diversified set of funds, your IRA for specific investments you can't hold in your 401(k), and your taxable account for liquid assets.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals** 
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy early, particularly tax implications when drawing from each account in retirement. 

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Annual or semi-annual reviews of your asset allocation and contributions can help ensure you stay on track with your goals.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation.

Before implementing these strategies, always consider your personal financial situation, tax bracket, and investment goals.
