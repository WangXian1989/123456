(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to take advantage of any matching contributions. After maximizing that, you could consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility and tax situation. Lastly, any remaining funds can be invested in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First off, definitely max out that 401(k) if your employerâ€™s throwing in matching contributionsâ€”free money, baby! After that, look at an IRA; if youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, thatâ€™s where you wanna be since those withdrawals are tax-free. Once you've tackled those goodies, put whateverâ€™s left in your taxable accountsâ€”flexibility is key! Just stay smart about capital gains taxes. Think of it like a buffet: fill up on the high-value options first (401(k) and IRA), then pick from the other tasty stuff (taxable accounts) without totally blowing your diet (aka budget). Always remember to align your approach with your long-term goals and maybe grab a financial guru for more personalized advice! ðŸ’°ðŸ˜‰
