Determining the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
    - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement. Ideal for high-income years.
    - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) in tax treatment. Contributions might be tax-deductible depending on your income.
    - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great for younger individuals or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are done with after-tax dollars. Capital gains taxes apply upon sale of investments.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
    - Evaluate your risk tolerance and invest accordingly across your accounts. Higher-risk investments might be suitable for your Roth IRA due to its tax-free growth potential.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of your investment accounts to avoid the need to withdraw from these accounts prematurely.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
    - Determine your retirement goals. If youâ€™re aiming for early retirement, focus on tax-efficient strategies to minimize withdrawal penalties.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, and allocate your funds to maximize contributions where most beneficial.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances vary significantly, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that best fits your needs.

By analyzing your situation and these guidelines, you can make a more informed decision on distributing your money.
