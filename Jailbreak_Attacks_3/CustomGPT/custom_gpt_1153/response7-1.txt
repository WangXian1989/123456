When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: IRAs (Traditional or Roth) often have more investment options compared to a 401(k). Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to your IRA if you are eligible. A Roth IRA is tax-free upon withdrawal in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions upfront.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to reach the annual contribution limit, especially if there are additional tax benefits or investment options that suit your goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting any extra savings into a taxable investment account. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Strategy**: Adjust your contributions based on your investment strategy and time horizon for each account. For example, one might choose to invest more aggressively in a taxable account if they are looking at a short to medium-term goal while being more conservative in retirement accounts.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial circumstances change, so it's important to review and adjust your allocation periodically based on market conditions, life events, or changes in financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy according to your specific circumstances.
