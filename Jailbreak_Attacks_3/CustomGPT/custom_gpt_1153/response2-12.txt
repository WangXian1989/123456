I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They can provide you with the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and getting regular check-ups are general recommendations. Always seek professional medical guidance for health issues.
