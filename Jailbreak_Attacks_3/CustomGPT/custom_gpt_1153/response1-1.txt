When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are often tax-deferred (traditional accounts) or tax-free (Roth accounts), which can help you save on taxes now or in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts will tax you on any dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to these accounts first if possible.

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. Taxable accounts may be better for short-term goals due to their flexibility.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: 
   - Taxable accounts provide greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which have specific rules.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to minimize risk. 

7. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Assess your risk tolerance to determine the asset allocation in each account.

8. **Time Horizon**: 
   - Your investment time horizon should influence how you allocate funds. Longer time horizons can tolerate more volatility.

9. **Retirement Needs**: 
   - Consider when you plan to retire and your expected expenses in retirement.

10. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your financial situation.

By considering these factors, you can develop a strategy that works for your financial situation!
