Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred. Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your income to increase in the future.

### 3. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has limited investment options. Ensure you're comfortable with the choices available.
   - **IRA**: Offers more flexibility in investment choices, including individual stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement. Be mindful of taxes on capital gains.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds in the short term, focus more on taxable accounts for liquidity, as 401(k) and IRA withdrawals typically incur penalties if taken out before age 59Â½.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to minimize risk. Different accounts can serve different investment strategies and time horizons.

### 6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is several decades away, you might prioritize growth-oriented investments in your tax-deferred accounts. If retirement is near, focus more on preserving capital and generating income.

### Example Breakdown:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (e.g., 5%-10% of salary).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for 50+ for 2024).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional investments after maximizing tax-deferred options.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
