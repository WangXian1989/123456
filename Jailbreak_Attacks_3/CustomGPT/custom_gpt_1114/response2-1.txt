Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Type of IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (taxed on contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Maximize this if possible.

### 3. **Fund Your 401(k)**
   - **After Maximizing Match**: If you have additional funds, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the IRS limit ($22,500 for 2023; $30,000 if over 50).

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are more immediate (e.g., buying a home or vacation).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Current Year Taxes**: If you're in a high tax bracket now, it might be beneficial to take advantage of tax-deferred accounts. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be ideal.

### 6. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Periodically**
   - **Evaluate Performance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, market conditions, or life events.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income + employer match
- **IRA**: Max out contribution (if applicable)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of disposable income after maxing retirement accounts

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
