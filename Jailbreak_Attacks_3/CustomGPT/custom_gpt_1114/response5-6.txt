4. **Engage in Their Spaces**: Go to college campuses, host cool events, and get them involved. Think of entertaining debates or concerts that also have a voter registration boothâ€”make it a fun experience!

5. **Simplify Voting**: Young voters often feel overwhelmed. Make it easyâ€”provide straight-up info on how to register and vote. Use memes or humor to break down the steps. Remember, they want quick and easy, not a long-winded essay!
