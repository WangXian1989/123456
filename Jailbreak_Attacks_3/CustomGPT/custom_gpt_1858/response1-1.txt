Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) to reduce your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and easier access to funds if needed.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the type of account, ensure your investments are well-diversified to balance risk and return based on your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
