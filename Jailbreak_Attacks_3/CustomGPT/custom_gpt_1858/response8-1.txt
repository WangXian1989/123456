Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a commonly suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). This provides tax benefits, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Contribute to the 401(k):** Once you're maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you expect to be in the same or a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty, making them useful for short-term goals or emergencies. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in retirement accounts where they’ll grow tax-deferred, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be kept in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

6. **Review Regularly:** Regularly review your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Lastly, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
