Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Max out employer match:** Start by contributing enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider tax benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), which can impact your current taxable income. Choose based on your expected future tax rate.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Tax-advantaged growth:** Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income bracket and tax strategy.
   - **Invest for the long term:** Both types of IRAs have different tax implications on withdrawals; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use these accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement, like real estate or stock investments.
   - **Tax planning:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; invest in tax-efficient funds or consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### General Strategy
- **Diversify:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Adjust based on age and goals:** Younger investors might prioritize tax-deferred accounts, while those nearing retirement may want to shift towards more liquid, taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A blended approach often works best, balancing short-term liquidity needs with long-term growth strategies. Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy based on your unique situation.
