(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, it's beneficial to maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first, then consider contributing to an IRA for potential tax advantages. After you've optimized those accounts, you can use any additional savings for taxable accounts. Remember to also consider a balance between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, snag that free money from your 401(k) by maxing out any employer matchâ€”free cash is always a win. Then, dive into an IRAâ€”whether it's traditional or Roth depends on your tax game plan. Once youâ€™re hitting those limits, throw whatever you can into taxable accounts because theyâ€™re super flexible. Just keep in mind the tax implications. Play around with asset allocation too; a mix of high-risk stocks for growth and conservative bonds can keep things spicy. Happy investing! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸
