To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Deferred Growth**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA, as these accounts offer tax-deferred growth on investments.
   - Consider your current tax bracket; contributing to these accounts can lower your taxable income.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate short-term gains or require liquidity. This includes stocks or mutual funds that you may want to access before retirement age.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Balance your portfolio to include a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative investments in each account type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to allow those investments to keep growing.

5. **Contributions and Limits**:
   - Stay updated on the contribution limits for each account type, ensuring you maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
