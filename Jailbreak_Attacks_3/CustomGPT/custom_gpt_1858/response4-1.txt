Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, maximize this first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, you can start putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts are flexible and offer access to your funds without penalties, though you’ll pay taxes on any gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, retirement accounts might be more aggressive since they have a longer time frame.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, think about how and when you'll withdraw from each account to minimize tax implications.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
