   - Engaging in regular physical activity.

2. **Medication**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Limiting or abstaining from alcohol can help prevent further liver damage.

4. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: 
   - Regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function.
