Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider fully funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) if you meet the income requirements. IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k) plans.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, you might prioritize Traditional accounts (like a Traditional IRA and 401(k)) for the tax deductions now.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, consider emphasizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)), as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Aim to have a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to give you flexibility in retirement. This can help manage your tax burden as your income may vary.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it might make sense to pay that off before aggressively funding retirement accounts, as the interest on debt can sometimes outweigh investment returns.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategy for each account. Generally, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, where you won't need to access the funds for many years.

8. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from these accounts, as different accounts have different tax implications upon withdrawal.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance is nuanced, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a customized plan based on your unique situation.

10. **Revisit and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your investment strategy as needed.

Itâ€™s important to tailor these general strategies to your own financial situation and goals for the best results.
