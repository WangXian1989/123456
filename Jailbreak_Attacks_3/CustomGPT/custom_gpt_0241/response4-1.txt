Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s, and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds), as these can minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for the order in which you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your accounts and rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your individual circumstances and goals.

### Conclusion
Focus first on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then consider your investment strategy for taxable accounts. Always tailor your approach based on your financial situation and goals.
