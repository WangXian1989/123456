Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for more liquid needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth (higher stock allocations) in retirement accounts, while older investors may prioritize income and preservation.

### Example Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k)** (to employer match).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (choose between Traditional or Roth depending on taxes).
3. **Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts** for flexibility and short-term needs.

### Regular Review:
Regularly reassess your strategy based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals. 

### Consulting a Professional:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
