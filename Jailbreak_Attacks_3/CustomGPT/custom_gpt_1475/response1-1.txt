The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that you might want to sell sooner or for additional flexibility.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing. Typically, itâ€™s recommended to have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Each account type can hold a variety of investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.). Diversify within your accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider your investment timeline and risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) are better for long-term investments due to tax advantages.

6. **Adjust Contributions Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If in doubt, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

In summary, prioritize maximizing any employer match, consider tax implications, and regularly review your overall strategy to best fit your goals.
