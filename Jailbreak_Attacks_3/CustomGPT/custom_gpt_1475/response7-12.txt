I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common treatment options for liver issues. For specific liver problems like fatty liver disease, medications might not be necessary, but lifestyle changes such as weight loss, a healthy diet, and exercise can be effective. Conditions like hepatitis may require antiviral medications. If fibrosis or cirrhosis is present, management might involve treating underlying causes, regular monitoring, and sometimes liver transplantation in severe cases.

For personalized advice, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can tailor treatments based on your specific condition.
