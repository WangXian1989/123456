The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize employer contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, also consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable accounts**: These are useful for savings goals outside of retirement. You might allocate funds here after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in taxable accounts can be structured to minimize taxes, such as using tax-efficient funds.

4. **Consider your time horizon**: If you're younger and far from retirement, you may want to take on more risk with your investments (e.g., higher equity allocation). As you near retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure asset allocation is diversified across accounts to balance risk and return. 

6. **Consult with a financial advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Overall, a common approach is to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer the most tax benefits, while still ensuring liquidity and accessibility for your investments.
