It's essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon when distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributing**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money. After that, consider how much you can afford to contribute based on your overall financial situation and goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are great for short-term goals since you have more flexibility with withdrawals. Focus on investments that may be tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all account types.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your financial goals and market conditions. 

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
