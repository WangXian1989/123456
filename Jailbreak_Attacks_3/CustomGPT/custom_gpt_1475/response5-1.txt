(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your current tax rate and expected retirement tax rate. Any additional funds can be allocated to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

First off, smash that 401(k) if your employer is tossing in matching contributionsâ€”grab that free cash, my friend!
