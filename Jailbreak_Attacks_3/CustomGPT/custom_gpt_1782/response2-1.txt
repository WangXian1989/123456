Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First:**
   - Take advantage of employer matching contributions.
   - Contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when choosing between Traditional and Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a home, travel).
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to manage capital gains.

4. **Diversification Among Accounts:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

**Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- Tailoring your strategy to your unique circumstances is crucial. A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

This approach can help you build wealth efficiently while considering your tax situation.
