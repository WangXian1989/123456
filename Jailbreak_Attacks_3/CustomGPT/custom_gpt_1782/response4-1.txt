Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep investments expected to grow significantly (like stocks) in taxable accounts for favorable capital gains tax treatment.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and asset allocation, making adjustments based on life changes or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and long-term growth strategies.

This broad strategy provides a balanced way to approach your investments while considering tax efficiency and retirement readiness.
