Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Start by maxing out your employer's match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing up to the annual limit if possible.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These are tax-deferred accounts, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on contributions or gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and timeline. For long-term growth, consider higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk effectively.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy early. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts should come first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
