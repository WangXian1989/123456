I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. Here are a few:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to support liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Liver Protectants**: Some supplements, like milk thistle, are thought to support liver health.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver recovery.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

5. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
