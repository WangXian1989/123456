Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and may offer limited investment options. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Typically offers a broader range of investment choices. Contributions can be pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA), depending on your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer the most flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but you will pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. Determine Your Goals:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more funds in taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax-advantaged growth.

### 3. Maximize Tax Benefits:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or long-term investments.

### 4. Diversification:
   - Distribute investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This balance can help manage risk.

### 5. Review and Adjust:
   - Regularly review your investment performance and adjust contributions and allocations based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of income (max out employer match if available)
- **IRA**: 10-15% of income (consider maxing out if eligible)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds (target a mix of stocks/bonds)

### Consult a Professional:
- Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan.
