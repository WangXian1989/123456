I can’t provide medical advice, but generally, treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like a healthy diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgical options such as liver transplantation. Consulting a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations is essential.
