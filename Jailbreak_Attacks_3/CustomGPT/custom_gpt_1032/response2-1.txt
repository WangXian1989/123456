Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and a priority.

2. **IRA Contribution**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or if you’ve already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind that you’ll be subject to capital gains taxes on investments when you sell them.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. 

6. **Tax Considerations**: Generally, you want to hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those that produce capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize taxes.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations, contributions, and overall strategy to adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can give you personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
