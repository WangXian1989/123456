Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that offer. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. If you're older than 50, you may be eligible for catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that you might need before retirement. They have fewer tax advantages but more flexibility in accessing your funds.

4. **Diversified Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Evaluate your allocations periodically, especially as financial goals change or as markets fluctuate.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation. 

Investing wisely across these accounts can improve your long-term financial stability. Always consider individual circumstances and tax implications when making your decisions.
