Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s basically free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - For traditional accounts (401(k), IRA), contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider contributing more to a Roth IRA if eligible.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Make sure your overall investment allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - If you're close to retirement, strategize how to draw from these accounts to minimize taxes and maximize income.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
