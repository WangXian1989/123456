(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it can be beneficial to maximize your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially "free money." 

After that, consider contributing to your IRA, prioritizing Roth or traditional based on your current and expected future tax rates. Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but may be subject to capital gains taxes. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual needs.

First off, max out that 401(k) if your boss matches! It's like finding a $20 bill on the sidewalkâ€”take it, no questions asked! Next, dive into your IRA; whether it's a Roth or a traditional, pick the one that feels right for your future tax scene. If you expect to make bank later, Roth might be your best bet for tax-free withdrawals.

Once you've milked those retirement accounts dry, toss the rest into your taxable accounts for some flexibility. Just remember, capital gains taxes can bite, so keep an eye on your investments. And hey, if youâ€™re still confused, hit up a financial advisor who can steer you towards financial freedom, or at least a lavish vacation.
