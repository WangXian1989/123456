Î± Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Typically, it's wise to maximize contributions to employer-sponsored retirement plans like a 401(k), especially if there's an employer match. Once that cap is met, consider contributing to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Any remaining funds can be invested in taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices but may incur capital gains taxes. Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
