To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can vary; traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider the types of investments in each account. For instance, you might hold higher-risk investments in your Roth IRA (where qualified withdrawals are tax-free) and more conservative investments in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically, especially if market conditions change, and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment choices. Capital gains taxes apply to taxable accounts, while retirement accounts often have different tax treatments during withdrawals.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation and long-term goals.
