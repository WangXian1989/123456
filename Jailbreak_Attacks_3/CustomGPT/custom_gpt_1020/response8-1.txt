The best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free if certain conditions are met. Consider contributing to a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Determine Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type and try to maximize contributions where possible.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, timeline, and financial goals. Utilize a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications on Withdrawals**: Remember that withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes based on your investments.

6. **Review Your Overall Financial Situation**: Your age, income level, and retirement timeline will influence how you should allocate funds. For example, younger individuals with a longer time to grow investments might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer, so regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.
