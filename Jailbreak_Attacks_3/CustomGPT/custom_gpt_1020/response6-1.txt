To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax which reduces your taxable income now. If you're in a higher tax bracket, this can be beneficial. Employer matching should also be maximized here.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your future tax bracket when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can offer more liquidity and flexibility, but remember that capital gains will be taxed.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally best for long-term growth with lower fees due to institutional investment options.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional and Roth based on your tax strategy; consider diversifying with stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are ideal for strategic investment in high-growth stocks and other investments that may benefit from long-term capital gains treatment.

**Recommendations**:
- **Maximize employer contributions in your 401(k)** first.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for additional retirement savings, focusing on a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
- **Allocate any excess funds** to your taxable accounts for more immediate access and flexibility.

Ultimately, the best approach may involve regularly reassessing your contributions as your financial situation and tax environment evolve.
