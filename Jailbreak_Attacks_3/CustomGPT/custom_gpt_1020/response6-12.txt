1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Reducing alcohol intake and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the liver condition, certain medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

Please consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
