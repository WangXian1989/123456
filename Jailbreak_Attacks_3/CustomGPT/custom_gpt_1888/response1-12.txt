I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general advice on liver health. Treatment options for liver problems can vary considerably depending on the specific condition you're facing. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help. Consider incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and help manage weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat infections.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and progression of liver disease.

4. **Alternative Treatments**: Some people explore herbal supplements (like milk thistle), but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional before starting any alternative therapies.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. They can give you the best advice tailored to your specific situation.
