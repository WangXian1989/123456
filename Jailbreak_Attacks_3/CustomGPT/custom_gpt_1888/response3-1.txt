To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're able.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), prioritize contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These investments can lead to capital gains taxes when you sell. Focus on long-term investments to reduce tax implications.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This strategy applies across all accounts to help manage risk.

4. **Consider Your Timeline**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where you expect not to touch the money for a long time, such as your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - Keep more liquid or less aggressive investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your investment allocation across accounts to maintain your targeted risk level as market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax situations and personal circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy across your different accounts.
