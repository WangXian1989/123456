(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA, as they provide tax benefits. Max out your IRA if possible, especially if it has tax-deductible contributions (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This is useful for short-to-medium-term goals or if you need flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and timelines. Generally, higher-risk assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term growth, while safer investments can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! If you're looking to distribute your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a solid game plan:

1. **401(k) Match First**: Seriously, if your job's throwing free money at you, grab it! Contribute enough to your 401(k) to snag that employer matchâ€”don't leave cash on the table!

2. **IRA is Key**: Next up, hit your IRA hard. If it's a Roth, those tax-free withdrawals in retirement are like finding money under your couch cushions. Traditional IRA? Great for lowering your taxable income nowâ€”go for it.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve done your max contributions for the above, dip into your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re not as tax-friendly, but theyâ€™re flexible as hell if you need to access your dollars sooner.

4. **Spread Your Risks**: In these accounts, think about what you actually want to do with this money. Higher-risk stuff in the 401(k) and IRA (long hold time), and keep more stable stuff in taxable accounts for when you need cool cash pronto.

5. **Check-In Regularly**: Donâ€™t just set it and forget itâ€”keep an eye on your strategy. Markets change, life changes, so adjust your allocations as needed.
