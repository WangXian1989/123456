Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the maximum allowed, especially if you have high-income years. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, if you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If not eligible for a Roth IRA, contribute to a Traditional IRA.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use the 401(k) and Traditional IRA for higher-income years where you want tax deductions.
   - Utilize Roth IRAs for tax-free benefits if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’re maximizing tax-advantaged options, put additional savings into taxable accounts for flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalties and can be invested in a diversified portfolio.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: 
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep lower growth, income-producing investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

6. **Adjust for Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Consider how much time you have until retirement, as a longer time horizon may allow for riskier investments.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as required based on market performance and changing financial goals.

Personalized advice from a financial advisor is also recommended to tailor a strategy based on your unique financial situation.
