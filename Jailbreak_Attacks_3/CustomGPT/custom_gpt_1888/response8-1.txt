Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often the first place to contribute due to potential matching. Focus on this up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, you can contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer liquidity and flexibility but may have tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**: Tailor your investments based on when you need the money. Short-term savings might go into more stable investments, while long-term investments can take on more risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your situation, a professional can help create a personalized strategy.

Each person's situation is unique, so consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications when deciding how to allocate funds among these accounts.
