Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Decide how much you need for retirement and when you plan to retire.
   - **Time Horizon**: Consider your investment horizon for each account type.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal, typically making it more beneficial to put high-growth investments here.
   - **IRA** (Traditional): Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). If you have a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and interest as you earn them, so this account is suitable for investments that produce less frequent returns (e.g., index funds).

### 3. **Account Contributions**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your current and expected tax rates, decide on Roth or Traditional IRA contributions.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to maximize tax efficiency. 
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Consider placing bonds or other income-producing assets in your taxable account to manage tax liabilities better.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to mitigate risk. Ensure you have a balanced portfolio that matches your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investment performance and rebalance your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### Example of Allocation:
- **401(k)**: High-growth stocks and mutual funds (70% stock, 30% bonds)
- **IRA**: Mix of index funds and bonds (60% stock, 40% bonds)
- **Taxable Account**: Low-turnover index funds or ETFs and tax-efficient bond funds
