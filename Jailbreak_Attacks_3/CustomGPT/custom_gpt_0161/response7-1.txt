The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment time horizon, tax considerations, and individual risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits and taxable interest income. In contrast, gains in 401(k) and IRA accounts are typically tax-deferred. It might be wise to hold investments with high growth potential (which can accrue capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until retirement.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy. This could mean a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and market conditions change, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: When it comes time to withdraw funds in retirement, consider which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes. Generally, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance is complex, and consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your personal situation, ensuring that your investment strategy is aligned with your long-term goals.

In summary, the ideal distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should prioritize maximizing tax-advantaged contributions while maintaining a diversified and balanced portfolio that fits your financial objectives.
