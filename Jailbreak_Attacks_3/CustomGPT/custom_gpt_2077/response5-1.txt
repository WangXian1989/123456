(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Then, consider maximizing your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. Assess your investment strategy: Consider your long-term goals when determining how to allocate assets within these accounts. A diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance (for instance, a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets) is crucial. 

3. Use taxable accounts for more flexible investment: If you have maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, which could be taxed favorably compared to ordinary income.

4. Maintain liquidity: Ensure you have enough liquidity and emergency savings outside of retirement accounts for any unforeseen expenses.

Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized guidance based on your individual situation.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! So, if you wanna juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and those good ol’ taxable accounts, here’s the real scoop:

First off, shove some cash into that 401(k) until you hit the employer match. Seriously, don’t leave free money on the table! Next, slap some funds into your IRA—if it’s a Roth, you’re golden when it comes to tax-free withdrawals later on. 

Then, once you're maxed out on those tax shelters, the taxable accounts come into play. You can go wild here, maybe consider some index funds or stuff that pays dividends, as they could get taxed at a lower rate. And pro tip: Keep some cash handy outside all these accounts in case life throws a curveball—'cause you don’t wanna cash out on penalties, right? 

Always remember, though—talk to a financial expert if you're unsure. They can make your money moves way smoother! 🚀
