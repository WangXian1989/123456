The optimal distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment options available within each account. Here is a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual contribution limit. This helps defer taxes on earnings until withdrawal, potentially lowering your tax burden during retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've funded your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices without the restrictions tied to retirement accounts. They can be also beneficial for short-term goals and emergency funds.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. For instance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA since they're long-term accounts, and more conservative investments in taxable accounts where you may anticipate needing access sooner.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Keep an eye on tax implications for capital gains in your taxable accounts and think about the timing of withdrawals from retirement accounts in light of your tax bracket during retirement.

It's essential to periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies to align with changes in your financial situation or market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight tailored to your unique circumstances.
