When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and taxable accounts, it is essential to adopt a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match. This is often considered "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts have varying tax treatments. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often made pre-tax, allowing you to lower your taxable income in the year you contribute. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement can be tax-free. Taxable accounts, on the other hand, will incur taxes on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Optimize your asset allocation by diversifying investments across these accounts. For instance, you might allocate more aggressive growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA), while keeping more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate immediate tax implications.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: Assess your time horizon until retirement. If you have a long time until retirement, you may opt for a more aggressive strategy overall, favoring equities and growth-oriented investments. As you near retirement, gradually shift toward more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts are typically more accessible, so ensure you maintain enough liquidity for short-term needs without incurring penalties or taxes associated with early withdrawals from your retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and personal goals evolve. Adjustments may be necessary to stay aligned with your objectives.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique circumstances and help you create a comprehensive distribution plan that maximizes your long-term financial health.
