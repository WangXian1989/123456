I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about common treatment options for liver problems. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personal medical advice. Here are some typical approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet Modification**: Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in physical activity to maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the condition and reduce liver damage.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Support**:
   - **Regular Check-Ups**: Regular follow-up with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and disease progression.
   - **Support Groups**: Connecting with others who have similar conditions can provide emotional support.

4. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In cases of severe liver damage or failure, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and to discuss the best options for your specific situation.
