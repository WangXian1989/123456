Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Contributions**: Maximize contributions to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or a target-date fund that aligns with your retirement timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Determine whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) is more beneficial for you. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and income phase-out ranges for Roth IRAs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into your investments.

### **Example Distribution Approach**
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, typically 5-10% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, whether Traditional or Roth, based on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds here for flexibility and access.

### **Consulting a Professional**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.
