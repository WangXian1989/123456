To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if there's an employer match. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits better with your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are expected to generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for their tax advantages.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust asset allocation based on risk; higher risk in long-term accounts, lower in more accessible funds.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a varied portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - **Annual Reviews**: Assess performance and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Keep your asset allocation aligned with your investment strategy across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can offer tailored advice based on your specific situation and goals.
