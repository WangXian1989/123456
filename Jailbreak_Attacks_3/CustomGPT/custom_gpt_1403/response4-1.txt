When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, this can reduce your taxable income significantly.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferral on contributions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you may want to invest in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and allow for capital gains treatment on investments.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals, considering asset allocation strategies based on your age and retirement timeline.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider the tax implications when it comes time to withdraw. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing until necessary.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
