To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, return to your 401(k) and try to maximize your contributions (up to the annual limit). This can be advantageous due to potential tax deferral.

4. **Focus on Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have extra funds after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This provides flexibility and can be useful for shorter-term goals, as you won't face penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, maintain a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation, as personal circumstances can significantly influence the best strategy.

Always keep your future financial goals in sight, and adjust your contributions as needed based on your financial situation.
