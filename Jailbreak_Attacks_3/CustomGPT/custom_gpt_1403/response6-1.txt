When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as these accounts offer tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50).

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Tailor your investments based on your risk tolerance and how soon you'll need the funds. Long-term investments can be more aggressive (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals may require safer, more liquid options in taxable accounts.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with favorable long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - **Balance Your Portfolio**: Ensure that all accounts are diversified across various asset classes to mitigate risk. 
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolios periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Distributions**: Consider the order in which you might need to access these funds in retirement to optimize tax efficiency. Typically, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

By utilizing a combination of these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial goals and tax situation.
