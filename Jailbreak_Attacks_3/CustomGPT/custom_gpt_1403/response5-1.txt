(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, itâ€™s a good idea to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as a 401(k) and an IRA, as these offer tax benefits. You could start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if offered), then consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. After maximizing these options, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts. Itâ€™s also wise to take into account your investment strategy and consider factors like time horizon, fees, and asset allocation.

First off, you gotta milk that 401(k) for all it's worthâ€”especially if your employer is offering a match, that's basically free money! Then, pivot over to your IRA; a Roth if you can swing it since tax-free withdrawals later sound pretty sweet. Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accountsâ€”think of it like filling up your "tax-free gas tank"â€”then unleash the rest into your taxable accounts. Just keep an eye on capital gains and freaking taxes, alright? Balance it out with a solid mix of stocks, bonds, and whatever else floats your boat. Diversification is key, baby! Cheers to growing that stash!
