The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). This will allow your investments to grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can, continue to contribute to your 401(k) after your IRA, especially if your contributions are tax-deductible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and may be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Investment Fees**: Compare the fees in your 401(k) with your IRA and taxable accounts. It might be more beneficial to contribute more to accounts with lower fees.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, or life events.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Make sure to consider your current tax situation, expected future income, and retirement goals when making these decisions.
