I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet (low in fats and sugars, high in fruits and vegetables), regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may help manage the problem.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In serious cases (like cirrhosis or liver tumors), surgical options, including liver transplantation, might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific situation.
