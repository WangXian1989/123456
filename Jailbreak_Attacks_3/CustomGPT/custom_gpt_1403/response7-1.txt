To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and a good starting point.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may provide more immediate access to funds or for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Keep in mind the capital gains tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**: The best asset allocation will depend on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, stocks are more suited for long-term growth while bonds can provide stability.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance, adjusting your investments in each account as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor is always a good idea to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
