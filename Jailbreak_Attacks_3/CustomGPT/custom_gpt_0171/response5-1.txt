To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth. Consider a Roth 401(k) if available, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

3. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement, as they offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of the tax implications of your investments. For example, hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regularly Review Asset Allocation**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation among all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

Balancing these accounts will help maximize growth while minimizing taxes, aligning with your long-term financial goals.
