I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Best treatment options for liver issues depend on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reduce saturated fats and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or avoid alcohol, which can further damage the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Doctors might prescribe medications to treat conditions like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Immune Therapy**: 
   - For autoimmune liver diseases, therapies may help suppress the immune response.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, such as liver cancer, surgical options like transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment plans.
