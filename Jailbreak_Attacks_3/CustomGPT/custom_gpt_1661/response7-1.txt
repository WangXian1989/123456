Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on high-growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA since withdrawals in retirement will be tax-advantaged (especially for Roth IRAs).
   - **Diversify Your Investments:** Consider a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Keep some money accessible in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, that generate less taxable income.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If youâ€™re in a high tax bracket now, focus more on tax-deferred accounts. In contrast, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts could be more beneficial.

### 5. **Regularly Re-assess Your Strategy:**
   - Monitor and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

### Example Strategy:
- Start with maxing out your 401(k) contribution to get the full employer match.
- Next, put money into a Roth IRA, if eligible, to benefit from tax-free withdrawals later.
- After those limits are met, invest in a taxable account for extra funds, focusing on tax-efficient options to minimize tax liability.
