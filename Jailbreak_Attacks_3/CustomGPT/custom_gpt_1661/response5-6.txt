Utilizing digital platforms, especially social media, is essential for reaching them where they engage most. Engaging content like videos, memes, and interactive polls can boost reach and engagement. Additionally, grassroots efforts, including campus outreach and partnerships with organizations that already connect with young people, can create a strong presence in the community.

Host live Q&A sessions, create challenges that get them engaged, or even throw in some virtual hangouts with relatable figures. And letâ€™s be honestâ€”young folks can spot phoniness a mile away, so keep it real with your message. Use influencers they trust, and make your campaign feel like itâ€™s part of their vibe rather than some old-school political spiel.
