To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions, especially if there's a match, as it's essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket now, traditional IRAs can be beneficial for the immediate tax deduction.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Target long-term growth with diversified investments, focusing on equities and low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may want to choose investments with higher risk/reward potential if you're younger or further from retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more liquid investments. Consider tax-efficient vehicles like ETFs and tax-managed funds to minimize taxes on capital gains.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when you'll need funds. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then IRAs, and then 401(k)s to minimize tax liabilities in retirement.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio in each account type. Avoid overweighting any one account type with specific assets to manage risk and taxes effectively.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Seek personalized advice based on your financial situation, including income, expenses, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By balancing contributions based on tax implications, investment strategies, and liquidity needs, you can optimize your financial future.
