Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for withdrawals and investing but subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Optimizing tax efficiency is crucial. Max out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, especially if you have matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - In periods of high income, favor tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or traditional IRA).

### 3. **Emergency and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Ensure you have liquidity for emergencies; keep enough in taxable accounts for short-term access.
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Consider how much risk you're willing to take. Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your goals and timeframe.

### 5. **Long-Term Planning**:
   - Focus on retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - As you approach retirement, consider gradually shifting to less volatile investments.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA (consider the type based on your tax situation)**.
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions up to the limit**.
4. **Invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and if youâ€™ve maxed out other accounts**.

### Final Thoughts:
Regularly review and adjust your allocation to align with changing financial circumstances and goals. Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
