Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to maximize your investments and minimize taxes. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching; contributions are usually pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (post-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains; offers more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your match, contribute to an IRA for the tax benefits.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts Firstly**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts.
   - **Consider Withdrawal Timing**: Understand how taxes will affect withdrawals in retirement. Roth accounts won't be taxed upon withdrawal, while traditional accounts will be.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and how long until you need the funds.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, but consider tax implications (e.g., keep high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts).

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio’s diversification and performance, and rebalance to maintain your desired allocation.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your individual financial situation.

This approach allows you to take advantage of the benefits of each account type while ensuring a balanced and effective investment strategy.
