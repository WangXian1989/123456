Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you qualify for tax deductions. This can reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that are not intended for long-term growth (like short-term trading) due to capital gains taxes. Consider holding assets like index funds that are tax-efficient.
   - **Long-Term Holdings**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments meant for the long haul to defer taxes until retirement.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon**:
   - If you expect to need the funds sooner, lean towards more liquid investments in your taxable accounts.
   - For long-term growth, stock-based investments can be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Your risk exposure should be consistent with your overall investment strategy, regardless of the account type.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your investments periodically to reflect changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
