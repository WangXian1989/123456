I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver problems and treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Certain medications can help manage liver disease, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be recommended.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find benefit from natural supplements, but consult your doctor before starting any.

Always follow your doctor's advice for the best outcomes.
