Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2024, $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Aim to contribute the maximum to your IRA ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50) if you're eligible.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, good for reducing taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Best for younger investors expecting higher future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, to manage your tax burden efficiently.

4. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), stocks may be appropriate in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals may be better served with low-risk investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may drift. Regularly review and adjust your investments to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

Make decisions based on your overall financial strategy and tax implications.
