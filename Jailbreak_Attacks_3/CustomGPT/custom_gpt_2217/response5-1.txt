The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **First**, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**:
   - **Next**, if you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have tax benefits that can grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions**, consider additional investments in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility and can be accessed without penalties, but they are subject to capital gains tax.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) and consider keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Assess your current and expected future tax brackets. It may be advantageous to prioritize accounts that offer the most tax relief based on your situation.

### 6. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing.

### 7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your investment distribution to adjust for changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
