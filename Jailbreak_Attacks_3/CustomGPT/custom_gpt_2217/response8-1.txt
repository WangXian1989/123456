Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to qualify for any employer matching funds. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to increase your contributions, especially if you are nearing the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, allocate any additional funds into taxable accounts. These are useful for financial goals that are shorter-term or may incur penalties for early withdrawal (like retirement accounts).

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in these tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that yield lower taxes or are tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations annually based on performance, changes in financial goals, or tax law changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
