To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Then, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments expected to grow significantly, as you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal (or may never pay them, in the case of Roth).
   - Keep lower-growth investments or those you may need access to soon in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - In retirement accounts, focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs).
   - In taxable accounts, consider fixed-income securities or dividend-paying stocks, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to optimize tax efficiency.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
