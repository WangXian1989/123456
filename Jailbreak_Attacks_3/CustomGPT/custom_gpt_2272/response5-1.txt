Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are flexible and can provide access to funds without penalties, but you’ll owe capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts. Bonds, for example, generate ordinary income, while stocks might benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Balanced Portfolio**: Regardless of account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and life events.

It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.
