I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Quitting alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Dietary Adjustments**: A diet low in fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can support liver function.

5. **Nutritional Supplements**: Supplements like milk thistle may be recommended, but consult your doctor first.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
