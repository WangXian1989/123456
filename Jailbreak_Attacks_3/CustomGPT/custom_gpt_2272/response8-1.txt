To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **IRA Account Type**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income is high and ineligible, use a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement, or for short-term goals. Consider prioritizing tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure you diversify your investments across all accounts and maintain a balanced asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account. Withdrawals from taxable accounts may be taxed differently compared to retirement accounts, especially before age 59Â½.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
