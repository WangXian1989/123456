Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Treatment:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Good for long-term growth as you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal. Suitable for investments expected to grow significantly.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Ideal for assets that may appreciate the most, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term needs or investments that might generate significant taxable income (like bonds). 

### 3. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors may allocate more to growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more stable investments (like bonds).

### 4. **Diversify:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment within each account type. Avoid concentrating too much in one area or asset class.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or after major life changes (e.g., job change, marriage) to align with your evolving financial situation.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical):
- **401(k)**: 40% of total retirement contributions
- **IRA**: 30% (with consideration for Roth/Traditional based on tax bracket)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30% for liquidity and accessibility

### Summary:
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
