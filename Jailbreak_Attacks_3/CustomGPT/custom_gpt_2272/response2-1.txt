Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (often considered "free money").
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions here as well. Traditional IRAs can give you upfront tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Horizon**
   - **Long-term**: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term**: Use taxable accounts for savings needed within the next few years. These accounts provide more liquidity.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for more favorable tax treatment.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement, so plan accordingly based on your expected tax bracket.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts. You can hold different types of assets in each account based on tax efficiency:
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider municipal bonds, index funds, or ETFs.
     - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, including stocks.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in market conditions or your personal circumstances.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding complex situations, consider consulting a financial planner.

### Summary
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first, then contribute to max limits.
- **IRA**: Fund for tax advantages; consider Roth for long-term growth.
- **Taxable**: Use for shorter-term needs or specific investment strategies.

By understanding these principles and tailoring them to your situation, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts.
