I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common treatment options for liver issues based on general knowledge. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water.
   - **Alcohol**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (like Hepatitis B or C).
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid retention.
   - **Nutritional supplements**: As recommended by a doctor.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasounds or CT scans) if necessary.

4. **Non-invasive Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: For varices (enlarged veins) if you have cirrhosis.
   - **Liver biopsy**: To assess liver damage.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplantation might be considered.

Always seek medical advice for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
