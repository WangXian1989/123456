Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** The 401(k) allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Having both types can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Emergency Funds:** These provide liquidity and can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Investing in Growth:** You can invest in stocks or funds that may grow over time, and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** In taxable accounts, you can sell losing investments to offset gains, reducing your tax burden.
   - **Income Level:** Your current and projected future tax brackets should influence where you place your investments.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly check your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

### Summary:
Start by maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA based on your tax preferences, and use taxable accounts for short-term needs or investments. Adjust as necessary to keep your strategy aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.
