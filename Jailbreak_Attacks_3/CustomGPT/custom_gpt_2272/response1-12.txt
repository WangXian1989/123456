I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about liver problems and treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Certain medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Weight Management**: For fatty liver disease, losing weight can help reduce fat in the liver.

4. **Supplements**: Some people benefit from supplements like vitamin E or milk thistle, but check with your doctor first.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek professional guidance for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
