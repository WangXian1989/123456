Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These donâ€™t have tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Short-Term (5 years or less): Consider taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Medium-Term (5-10 years): A mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Long-Term (10+ years): Focus on maxing out your retirement accounts for growth and tax advantages.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have cash reserves in a traditional savings account before committing significant funds to investments.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Stocks may be suitable for retirement accounts, while bonds might fit better in taxable accounts due to tax efficiency.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider speaking with a financial professional who can help align your investment strategy with your goals.

Starting with these principles can help you create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
