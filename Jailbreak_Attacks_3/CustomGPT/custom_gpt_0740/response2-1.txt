Distributing your money optimally across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the fees and investment options available in your 401(k). If you have low-cost funds, this might be a great place to allocate a significant portion of your retirement savings.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits (currently $6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access sooner than retirement, like saving for a home or other short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider placing dividends or interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match** in your 401(k).
- Contribute to your **IRA** (preferably Roth if eligible).
- Continue to fund your **401(k)** up to the contribution limits if possible.
- Use any additional funds for **taxable accounts** for investment growth or liquidity needs.

Lastly, tailor this distribution according to your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and tax situation. How do you envision your financial goals shaping your investment strategy?
