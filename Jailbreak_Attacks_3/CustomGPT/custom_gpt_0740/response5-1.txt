(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically tax-deferred, meaning you don't pay taxes on them until withdrawal. In contrast, contributions to Roth IRAs are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts will incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Investment Goals**: If you're saving for retirement and have a long time horizon, you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. If you have short-term goals, consider keeping more money in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts, not just in one type.

To come up with a more tailored approach, consider your current tax bracket, expected future tax situation, and investment time frame. Would you like to explore specific percentages or allocations based on your situation?

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break down the cash distribution like a boss! First off, youâ€™ve got to play the game smartâ€”maximize that company match on your 401(k) because who doesnâ€™t want free money?! Seriously, thatâ€™s a no-brainer.

Next, think about your future taxes. If you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket when you pull out your savings, load up that Roth IRA where you pay taxes now and kick back while your withdrawals are tax-free later. Taxable accounts can also play a roleâ€”theyâ€™re flexible for any "yay I made it!" moments, but beware of pesky taxes on the gains. Set your accounts up like a diversified playlist, adjusting the ratio based on your risk tolerance and plans. 

What specific goals do you have in mindâ€”are we talking "retirement boat" or "travel the world" vibes? Letâ€™s fine-tune those allocations!
