The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribute enough** to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a high tax bracket, as contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A **Traditional IRA** can be beneficial if you want to reduce your taxable income now, but be aware of the tax implications when you withdraw during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you may need before retirement. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Start with the 401(k) for any employer match.
- If in a lower tax bracket, focus on Roth IRA contributions.
- Utilize taxable accounts for shorter-term savings or more accessible funds.

### Things to Consider:
- Monitor your asset allocation in each account type.
- Be mindful of tax implications when selling investments in taxable accounts.
- Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals.
