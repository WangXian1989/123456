When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: If you have an employer match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider fully funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you're eligible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Generally, investments held for more than a year are taxed at a lower rate. This account can offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Place more aggressively growing assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. More conservative assets (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to help manage taxes on interest income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing in any of these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses outside of these investment vehicles.

5. **Continual Review**: Reassess your investment distribution periodically based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. 

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
