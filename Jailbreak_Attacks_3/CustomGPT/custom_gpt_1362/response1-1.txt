When deciding how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, taxes will be applied differently. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free on withdrawal if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends in the year they are realized. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with tax considerations.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before maximizing retirement contributions, ensure you have an emergency fund (around 3-6 months' expenses) in an accessible savings account.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement goals and expected expenses. If you plan to retire early, allocate more towards taxable accounts for quicker access without penalties.

6. **Balance Contributions**: If you hit the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, consider increasing contributions to your taxable accounts. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consulting with a financial planner can provide insights based on your overall financial goals.

This approach combines taking advantage of tax efficiency while ensuring you have sufficient funds available for both short-term needs and long-term growth.
