To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Generally provides tax benefits, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** IRAs can provide valuable tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but come with tax implications on capital gains and income.

2. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals:**
   - Consider your retirement timeline, what you want to achieve (e.g., buying a home, retirement), and your risk tolerance.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

4. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts:**
   - Aim to max out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

5. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. For instance, it might be beneficial to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account, while keeping more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Balance Your Asset Allocation:**
   - Maintain a consistent asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. This may involve adjusting your investments in each account based on performance and market conditions.

7. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Be mindful of tax-efficient investing, especially in taxable accounts. Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting or consider municipal bonds, which may offer tax-free income.

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they still align with your financial goals. Make adjustments as needed based on life changes or market shifts.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.

By following these steps, you can develop a balanced strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
