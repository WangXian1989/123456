Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial depending on your current and anticipated future tax rate.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after contributing to IRAs, continue to invest in your 401(k) to take advantage of any additional benefits it may offer, such as lower-fee investment options or automatic rebalancing.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties (though taxes will apply to any capital gains).

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that you are diversifying your investments across different asset classes to manage risk effectively. 

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Your age and how close you are to retirement should influence how aggressively you invest. Younger individuals may prioritize growth investments, while those nearing retirement may want to shift towards more stable, income-generating investments.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and overall financial strategy based on changes in your income, market conditions, and financial goals.
