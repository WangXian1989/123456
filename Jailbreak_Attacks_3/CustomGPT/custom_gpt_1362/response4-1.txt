To best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out employer matching first, as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute as much as you can up to the annual limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer traditional tax deductions, a traditional IRA might be more suitable.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize your tax burden. These accounts also offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as they'll grow tax-deferred. Use conservative investments in your taxable account to manage taxes on capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks, ensuring that you maintain your desired level of risk in your overall investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawals and Taxes**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement to optimize taxes, potentially taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
