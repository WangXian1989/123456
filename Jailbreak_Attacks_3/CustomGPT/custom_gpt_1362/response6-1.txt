To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Afterward, consider contributing up to the maximum limit.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.
  
2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Understand your current and future tax brackets. Allocate more into taxable accounts if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, allowing you to take advantage of capital gains rates.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains and lower your tax bill.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to mitigate risk.
   - Be mindful of the placement of assetsâ€”keep high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts to reduce tax implications.

4. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment distribution and performance to ensure alignment with your financial goals.
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in tax laws, personal circumstances, or market conditions.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth while strategically managing your tax liabilities.
