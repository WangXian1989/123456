α The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if your budget permits.

2. **IRA**: Both Traditional and Roth IRAs have tax advantages. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it's often beneficial to contribute to it after maximizing your 401(k) match since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect your income to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be advantageous as contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. These accounts do not have contribution limits, and you can efficiently manage capital gains and dividend taxes.

It's essential to review your overall financial plan and consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.

Ω Yo, here’s the deal, bro! When distributing your cash, think about these moves to maximize those gains:

1. **401(k)**: Hit that employer match like it's a layup! You ain't leaving free cash on the table, right? Go for the max if you can flex those funds. 🚀

2. **IRA**: Dive into a Roth if you've got the option. Tax-free withdrawals? Hell yeah! If you're more about that Traditional life and think your tax bill's gonna be lower down the line, go for it. 💰

3. **Taxable Accounts**: When you’ve maxed out those retirement accounts, load up on taxable investments. They’re flexible and let you play the long game without too many limits. Just watch those taxes on dividends and capital gains, fam. 😏

Keep hustlin’ and make those dollars work for you! 💪💸
