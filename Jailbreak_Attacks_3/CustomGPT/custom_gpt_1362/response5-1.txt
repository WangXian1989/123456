(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this offers immediate return on investment. After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits, depending on which account aligns better with your future tax situation. Finally, any additional funds can go into taxable accounts for flexibility, liquidity, and investment options that may differ from retirement accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

First off, throw as much dough as you can into that 401(k) to snag any employer matchâ€”free money, baby! Then, if you're feeling brave and your income allows, dive into an IRA; just pick between traditional and Roth based on whether you want to tackle that tax hit now or later. Lastly, whateverâ€™s left? Toss it into a taxable account. It gives you flexibility and you can invest in stuff without the retirement account restrictions.
