Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, and earnings grow tax-deferred.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed at any time without penalties, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Investment income and capital gains are taxable, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start with this to ensure you take advantage of matching contributions.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, prioritize a Roth or Traditional IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing your IRA, contribute more to the 401(k) if possible.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use leftover funds for taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### General Tips
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor or tax professional. They can help you navigate complex tax implications and investment strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
