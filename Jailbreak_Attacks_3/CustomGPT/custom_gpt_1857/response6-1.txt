To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your goals, tax situation, and time horizon:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

### 2. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in stocks or funds that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Objectives and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on stocks or equity funds in your tax-advantaged accounts. Longer time horizons can bear more risk.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Keep more liquid, conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

### Quick Checklist:
- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**
- **Fund IRA accounts depending on eligibility**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity**

This approach can optimize your tax situation and align your investments with your financial goals. For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.
