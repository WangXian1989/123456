I'm not a doctor, but addressing liver problems typically involves lifestyle changes, medication, and sometimes more advanced treatments. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver function.
   - **Limit Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, your doctor might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging tests to monitor liver function and detect complications early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant might be an option if other treatments are not effective.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find supplements like milk thistle helpful, but always consult your doctor first.

Make sure to discuss your specific condition with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice.
