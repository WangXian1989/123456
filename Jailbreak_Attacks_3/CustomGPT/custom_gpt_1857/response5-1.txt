To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Since contributions are pre-tax, invest in assets with higher growth potential (e.g., stocks) here to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA, your strategy may vary. For a traditional IRA, similar to a 401(k), focus on long-term growth. In a Roth IRA, investing in growth assets is beneficial as the withdrawals are tax-free after retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments such as municipal bonds or ETFs that have low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Contribution Limits and Matching**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - After maxing out the 401(k) match, focus on contributing to your IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. 

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to lower risk. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan strategically for withdrawals in retirement. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like the 401(k) and IRA, leaving tax-free accounts for last.

5. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation and goals.
