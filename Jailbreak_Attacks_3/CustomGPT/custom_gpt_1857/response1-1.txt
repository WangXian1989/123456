Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - A Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits ($6,500 for most individuals in 2023, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalty, making it useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies, as you’ll face capital gains taxes on gains when you sell assets.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match first.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Contribute to your IRA next, prioritizing a Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
- **Fill the Gaps**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments, focusing on longer-term strategies to minimize taxes.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might focus more on growth through aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement may prioritize capital preservation.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Make sure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your distribution periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
