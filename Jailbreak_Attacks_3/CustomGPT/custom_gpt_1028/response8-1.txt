To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This "free money" is a great return on investment.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) match, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs. This minimizes capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Hold higher-growth investments that may generate higher taxes when sold, as they grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) is aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversify within each account to avoid over-concentration.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to maintain your desired risk levels and objectives, taking into account which accounts are performing well.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're decades from retirement, focus on growth. As you approach retirement, shift towards income-producing and lower-risk investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
