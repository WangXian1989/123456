To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: This is typically pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider maxing this out to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth). Assess which is more beneficial based on your current tax status and future expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, you might want higher-growth, riskier investments in your tax-advantaged accounts (due to long-term capital gains tax advantages) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Monitor your investment performance and asset allocation regularly, rebalancing as necessary to align with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique financial situation.
