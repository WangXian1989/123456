1. **Get in their Feeds**: Forget boring adsâ€”think viral campaigns on TikTok or meme-fueled Instagram stories. If it doesnâ€™t make them laugh or gasp, itâ€™s gone in a scroll.

2. **Show Realness**: No more polished politicians! Young people want to see authentic stories and faces they can relate to. Think influencers who arenâ€™t afraid to be goofy and realâ€”thatâ€™s where the gold is.

3. **Hit Them Where It Hurts**: Talk about the stuff they care aboutâ€”debt, climate change, and social issues. Make it clear how voting affects their lives, but keep it fun and engaging!

4. **Gamify it**: Use challenges and contests to create buzz. Get creativeâ€”how about a TikTok dance-off to register voters? Make voting cool!

5. **Local Heroes**: Bring in local voices and grassroots groups. Young folks love community vibes. Get them pumped about making a real difference right where they live.
