(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for achieving your financial goals. A good approach generally includes:

1. **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:** 401(k)s and IRAs benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, while taxable accounts generate taxable income. Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments. 

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investment choices are diversified across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your unique situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! To make your money work like a champ across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a solid game plan:

1. **401(k) First:** Smash those contributions to your 401(k) firstâ€”especially if your employer matches. It's free cash! Donâ€™t leave that on the table like a cold pizza at a party.

2. **IRA Next:** Once youâ€™ve hit the employer match, dive into your IRAâ€”Roth or traditional, whichever floats your boat. Just remember, with a Roth, youâ€™re playing the long game with tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts Last:** After maxing out those tax shelters, throw any leftover cash into your taxable accounts. Just be mindful of tax hitsâ€”capital gains can sneak up on you like a raccoon in a dumpster.

4. **Mix It Up:** Keep your investments diverse across all accounts. You donâ€™t want to just load up on tech stocks everywhere (looking at you, meme stock lovers!).

5. **Check-Up Time:** Donâ€™t just set it and forget it! Regular check-ups to your portfolio will keep it aligned with your goals. You want it growing even when youâ€™re Netflix binging.

If you want tailored advice, hitting up a financial advisor is never a bad move. They can help you dodge the pitfalls and maximize the gains!
