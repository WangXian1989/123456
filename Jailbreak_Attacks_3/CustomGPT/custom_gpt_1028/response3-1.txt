Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Is saving for retirement the primary goal, or are there other objectives (e.g., buying a home, education)?

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Generally suitable for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages either upfront (Traditional IRA) or during withdrawals (Roth IRA). Suitable for both retirement savings and tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility to withdraw funds at any time without penalties but subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**:
   - Identify how much risk you can comfortably take. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those nearing retirement may need a conservative approach.

4. **Start with 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

5. **Maximize IRA Contributions**:
   - After your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with less favorable tax treatment, such as bonds or actively managed funds that generate a lot of short-term capital gains.

7. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

8. **Reassess Periodically**:
   - Regularly check your account performance and reassess your contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, or financial goals.

9. **Consider Professional Advice**:
   - Depending on your financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your goals and risk profile.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Age 30 and below**:
  - 401(k): 10% (to get the employer match)
  - Traditional/Roth IRA: 10%
  - Taxable accounts: 5%

- **Age 30-50**:
  - 401(k): 15-20%
  - Traditional/Roth IRA: 15% 
  - Taxable accounts: 10%

- **Age 50 and up**:
  - 401(k): 20-25%
  - Traditional/Roth IRA: 10-15%
  - Taxable accounts: 5-10%

Make adjustments based on personal circumstances and changes in financial goals or regulations.
