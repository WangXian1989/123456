Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer matching. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends) to minimize your tax burden.
   - **Asset Location:** Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while putting lower-growth (bonds) or tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Mix of Investments:** Ensure you are diversified across asset classes like stocks, bonds, and other investments to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### 4. **Personal Financial Goals**
   - Define your short-term, mid-term, and long-term financial objectives, which will influence how aggressively you invest in these accounts.
   - Your age and risk tolerance will also help dictate the appropriate asset mix.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial objectives and prepares you for retirement.
