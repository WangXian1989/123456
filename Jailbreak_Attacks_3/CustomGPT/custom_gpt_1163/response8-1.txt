Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful planning and consideration of several factors. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your investments:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before investing additional funds in other accounts. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($20,500 for 2022, with a catch-up contribution of $6,500 for those 50 and older) if you havenâ€™t already.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The IRA limit for 2022 is $6,000, or $7,000 if you're 50 or older.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can funnel funds into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, tax-deferred accounts (like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s) may be more beneficial. If you believe your tax rate will be lower, Roth accounts may be more advantageous.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Typically, you would want to hold more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-deferred accounts where you can defer taxes on gains, and more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts since they may generate interest that is taxable annually.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure of the best strategy for your individual circumstances, it may be worth consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
