(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, you may want to consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively "free money."
2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: Contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Traditional IRAs can give you tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Balance Contributions**: If you're maxing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider allocating any excess funds to a taxable account. This gives you more flexible access to your money before retirement age without penalties.
4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
