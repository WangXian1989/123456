When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider contributing to an IRA if you qualify. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, potentially lowering your current taxable income.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. Therefore, consider keeping investments that are expected to appreciate significantly (and thus generate capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate tax owed on gains.
   - Evaluate the timing of withdrawals and tax implications of your investment choices based on your expected tax bracket at retirement.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversifying among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) can mitigate risk.
   
4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations across accounts to ensure they remain aligned with your overall investment strategy and goals. Rebalancing can help you maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think ahead about how you plan to draw funds in retirement. Depending on your circumstances, it may be beneficial to withdraw from different accounts in a certain order to optimize tax efficiency.

Before making any financial decisions, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
