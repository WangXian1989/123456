(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, consider the following guidelines: 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. The investment options available may be limited compared to other accounts, so choose based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket upon retirement; this allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA might be a better choice if you want immediate tax benefits. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds, or for funds you might need before retirement. This flexibility allows you access without penalties.

Balancing contributions based on your financial priorities, tax strategies, and time horizon is essential for optimizing your overall investment strategy.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The key to dividing up your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really hinges on a few factors. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k)**: First off, if you've got an employer match, max that baby out! Seriously, thatâ€™s free cash! Beyond that, get your investment game on; if the options are weak, don't be afraid to lean more into your IRA or taxable accounts.

2. **IRA**: Go for the Roth if you want your future self to thank you while sipping piÃ±a coladas in retirement (tax-free withdrawals!). Traditional IRA can serve you well for the tax break now if you expect lower taxes later. 

3. **Taxable**: Yep, they might sound boring, but taxable accounts can be your flexible friend. Perfect for short-term goals or as your early retirement stash. Just watch out for those taxes eating into your returns!

In essence, itâ€™s about maximizing tax benefits now while keeping an eye on your future. Diversify wisely and keep your financial goals in check! ðŸŽ¯ðŸ’°
