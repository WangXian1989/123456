The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially “free money.” Aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, start investing in a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Diversification:** 
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return. Different accounts can hold various asset classes based on their tax treatment.

4. **Long-Term Strategy:**
   - Your 401(k) and IRA funds should generally be focused on long-term growth, while a taxable account can be more flexible for shorter-term needs or goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation, especially if you have complex assets or tax considerations.

By following these steps, you can create a well-rounded strategy that maximizes tax advantages while positioning your investments for growth over time.
