(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, many advisors suggest maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other options. This is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs have tax advantages as well, depending on your income and employment situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin investing in taxable accounts for additional savings. Keep in mind that investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

It's essential to align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals, potentially consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations.
