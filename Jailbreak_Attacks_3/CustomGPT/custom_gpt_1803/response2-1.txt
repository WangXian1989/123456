The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed, especially if you have a high tax rate. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and access, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment:**
   - Focus on creating a mix of taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts. This strategy allows for more flexibility in retirement, as you can choose which accounts to withdraw from based on your tax situation at that time.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains. Consider holding index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover.

5. **Factor in Your Time Horizon:** Your age, retirement date, and investment goals will also influence your asset allocation. Younger individuals may benefit from aggressive growth investments, while those closer to retirement may want to preserve capital and focus on income.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust Your Allocations:** As market conditions change, your financial situation, or your goals, make adjustments accordingly.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** It's often beneficial to discuss your situation with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.

By balancing contributions among these accounts strategically, you can optimize your tax situation and build a robust retirement portfolio.
