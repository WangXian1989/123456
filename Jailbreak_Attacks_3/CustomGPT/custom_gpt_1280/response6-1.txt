To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
- **Fund your IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if your income allows. A traditional IRA can be beneficial for tax deductions if you qualify.

### 2. Utilize Taxable Accounts Strategically
- **Invest Excess Funds**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Choose tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals
- **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts, where you won’t need to withdraw for many years.
- **Shorter-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid or conservative investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. Evaluate Investment Types
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize stocks and other growth assets in your 401(k) and IRA for deferred tax advantages.
- **Taxable Investments**: Use municipal bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, investment performance, and life circumstances.
