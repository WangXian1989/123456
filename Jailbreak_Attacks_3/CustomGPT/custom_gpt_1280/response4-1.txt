Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can generate capital gains or dividends that may be taxed annually.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have cash reserves in a savings account or taxable account for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Invest for Growth**: Consider placing more aggressive growth investments in your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth potential.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and perhaps some cash or other assets.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios based on performance and changing financial goals. 

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation. 

Always consider your own financial goals and circumstances when making these decisions.
