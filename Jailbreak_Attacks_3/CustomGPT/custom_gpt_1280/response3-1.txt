Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after contributing to the IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re aiming for long-term retirement savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments that you might want to access before retirement. They offer more flexibility, although you’ll need to pay capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep tax implications in mind for each account. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

8. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on your financial situation, market conditions, or changes in retirement plans.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
