To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals, or to invest in assets that have favorable tax treatments (like long-term capital gains).

3. **Investment Goals**: Determine your time horizon. Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments, while maintaining more liquid assets in taxable accounts for potential shorter-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stock and bond funds across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these principles, you can help maximize your investment growth while managing risks and taxes effectively.
