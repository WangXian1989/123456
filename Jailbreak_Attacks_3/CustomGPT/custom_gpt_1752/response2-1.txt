Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. This reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts if you've maxed out your retirement accounts or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement. These accounts provide flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be appropriate for those closer to retirement.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Less volatile investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes effectively.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your account allocations and performance to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
