To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, and many employers offer matching contributions.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Also tax-deferred, contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and if you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but you can manage capital gains and losses more flexibly.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Max Out Roth IRA:** If eligible, max out contributions to your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Consider Traditional IRA:** If you’re not eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA, especially if you can deduct it from your taxes.
   - **Continue to 401(k):** After maximizing the above, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term investments and equities since you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal (or tax-free for Roth).
   - Keep more conservative investments, such as bonds, in taxable accounts where you can better manage tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement, factoring in tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help minimize the tax burden while allowing your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 5. **Review Annually:**
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions as your income, financial goals, and tax laws change.

A balanced approach can ensure you're maximizing growth while minimizing taxes throughout your investing journey. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a wise decision.
