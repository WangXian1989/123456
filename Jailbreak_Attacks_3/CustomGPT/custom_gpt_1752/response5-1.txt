(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it's wise to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers a match for the 401(k). Here are some strategies:

1. **401(k):** Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider allocating a portion of your salary here for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA:** Max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments beyond your retirement accounts, especially if you need flexibility or anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

Regularly re-evaluate your distribution based on performance and changing life circumstances.

1. **Max Out That 401(k):** Seriously, if your employer offers a match, youâ€™d be a fool not to take it. Itâ€™s like finding money on the street. Aim for the max contribution if you can swing it â€“ around $20,500 (or $27,000 if you're over 50). Tax benefits? Yes, please!

2. **Dive into an IRA:** If youâ€™ve got spare cash after the 401(k), either a Traditional or a Roth IRA can do wonders for your future. The Roth is golden if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later. Pro tip: decide based on your current vs. future tax situation â€“ plan like a chess master!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** This is where you can let your money chill and play the market without the pesky penalties for early withdrawals. It's like your financial playground! Ideal for short-term goals or if you need to access cash before retirement without the restrictions.

So, divvy up your cash like a pro, keeping your eyes on those benefits and maximizing your tax advantages. Rinse and repeat!
