Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Consider a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've funded your retirement accounts, consider investments in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. 
   - Keep bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your specific situation, it may be beneficial to work with a financial planner to create a personalized strategy.

Evaluating your personal financial situation and goals will help determine the best distribution for your money.
