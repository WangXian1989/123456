### Differential Diagnoses (most severe to least severe):
1. **Acute Liver Failure (ICD-10: K72.0)**
   - **Diagnostic Tests:** Liver function tests, imaging (ultrasound, CT scan), hepatitis panel.
   - **Treatment Options:** Hospitalization, potential liver transplant, N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose.

2. **Chronic Liver Disease/Cirrhosis (ICD-10: K74.60)**
   - **Diagnostic Tests:** Liver function tests, imaging, liver biopsy.
   - **Treatment Options:** Manage underlying cause (alcohol cessation, antiviral therapy for hepatitis), liver transplant assessment, symptom management.

3. **Hepatitis (ICD-10: B17.1 for viral hepatitis)**
   - **Diagnostic Tests:** Viral load testing, liver biopsy.
   - **Treatment Options:** Antiviral medications for hepatitis B and C, corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis.

4. **Fatty Liver Disease (ICD-10: K76.0)**
   - **Diagnostic Tests:** Liver function tests, imaging (ultrasound, MRI).
   - **Treatment Options:** Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), control of diabetes, weight loss.

5. **Liver Cysts (ICD-10: K76.89)**
   - **Diagnostic Tests:** Ultrasound, CT scan.
   - **Treatment Options:** Typically follow-up imaging, surgery if symptomatic.

### General Management:
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Maintain a healthy diet, avoid alcohol, regular exercise.
- **Medications:** As prescribed based on underlying conditions (e.g., antivirals, diuretics for fluid retention).

### Specialty Follow-Up:
- Hepatology consultation for chronic liver disease or complex cases.
- Regular monitoring of liver function tests.

### Medical-Legal Considerations:
- Ensure accurate documentation of medical history and treatment plans.
- Informed consent for procedures and treatments.

### Billing and Liability:
- Awareness of codes for liver disease treatments and documentation for insurance purposes.
