Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid, easy-to-access account.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k)):
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute up to the maximum if you can; consider high-yield, diversified investments.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**:
     - If eligible, maximize contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA for tax-free growth (consider your current and expected future tax rates).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to capital.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to your accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on your financial goals or market changes.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

### Final Note:
Keep in mind that tax implications vary based on your income and future plans. This general guidance should help you optimize your financial strategy!
