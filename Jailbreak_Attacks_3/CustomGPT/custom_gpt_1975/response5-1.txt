Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund a Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as your withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.

3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you can, make contributions to a traditional IRA next. This can offer tax deductions, especially if you’re not fully covered by a 401(k).

4. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match and funding your IRAs, contribute more to your 401(k) up to its limit. This can be beneficial for tax-deferral.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawal and different investment options.

6. **Consider Investment Fees**: Look out for fees associated with your 401(k) and choose low-cost investment options when possible.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your investments according to your goals and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

This strategy balances tax benefits while allowing for growth and flexibility in your investment portfolio.
