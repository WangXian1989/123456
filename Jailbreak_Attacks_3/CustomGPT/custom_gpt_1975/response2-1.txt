Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy you can consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Traditional or Roth**: A Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current tax rate versus expected future rates.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If eligible, try to contribute the maximum allowed each year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **For Shorter-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Allocation Tips:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3 to 6 months of expenses in a liquid, high-yield savings account before heavily investing.
- **Diversify Investments**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) regardless of the account type.
- **Adjust Based on Age**: Younger investors might prioritize growth (more stocks), while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk (more bonds).
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Evaluate Regularly:

- Review your financial goals and performance regularly to adjust your plan as needed.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
