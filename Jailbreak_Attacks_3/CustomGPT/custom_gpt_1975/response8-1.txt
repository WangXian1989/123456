To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older).
   - IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k), but income limits may affect deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money but grow tax-free. Opt for this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on how far you are from retirement. A longer time horizon may justify riskier investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient amount in a taxable account for emergencies, typically 3-6 months of expenses.

8. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies can also be beneficial.
