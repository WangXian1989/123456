To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Evaluate your current tax rate and expected future rate upon retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which type aligns with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, but you can manage tax liability by investing in tax-efficient funds or holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Focus on Growth Assets**: Consider putting higher growth potential investments in your taxable accounts, where long-term capital gains taxes apply, and place more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and your changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your financial situation, seeking professional advice can be beneficial.

By employing this multi-faceted approach, you can optimize your investment strategy and align it with your long-term financial goals.
