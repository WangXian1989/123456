Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider when balancing these accounts:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Your Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the current year. Consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) if available, as it provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for additional tax-deferred growth. You may be able to deduct contributions depending on your income and whether you have a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest in After-Tax Gains**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains, like stocks, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. This strategy can also provide liquidity.
   - **Emergency Funds or Short-Term Goals**: Allocate money in taxable accounts for emergency savings or short-term goals, as these funds are more accessible without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation and Diversification:**
   - **Diverse Investments**: In all accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts.
   - **Avoid Overconcentration**: Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in any investment across all accounts, as this can increase risk.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - **Stay Informed**: Review your contributions and investment performance at least annually.
   - **Rebalance**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account changes in your risk tolerance or life circumstances.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Be thoughtful of tax implications as you withdraw funds, particularly from tax-deferred accounts.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider how you will withdraw funds in a tax-efficient manner.

This general framework can be customized based on individual circumstances, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
