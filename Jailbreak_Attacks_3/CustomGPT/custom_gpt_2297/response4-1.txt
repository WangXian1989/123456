Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**: Each account has different tax implications and rules.
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-advantaged retirement plan offered by employers. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k), but usually set up independently. Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to your IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - Invest any additional funds in a taxable account for flexibility.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth investments (like stocks) can be beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) might be more suitable in taxable accounts, where interest is taxed as income.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be aware of your current and expected future tax brackets. It may be advantageous to take a tax deduction now with 401(k) or traditional IRA contributions while also considering the benefits of tax-free growth with Roth accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw money from each account in retirement. Strategies can impact your tax liability significantly.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review your asset allocation and distribution strategy, especially as you approach retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice suited to your specific situation and ensure you are making informed decisions regarding your investments.
