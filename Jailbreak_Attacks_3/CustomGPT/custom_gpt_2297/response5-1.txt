(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributing to a 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After reaching that match, consider funding your IRA, especially if it allows for tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth, depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA. Lastly, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access to funds before retirement. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Next up, tackle your IRA. If you can score a Roth IRA, go for it since that tax-free growth can really crank up your returns down the line! After youâ€™ve maxed those out, go ahead and toss some funds into your taxable accounts. Sure, they might take a hit during tax season, but you'll have more access to your cash when you need it. Ultimately, play around with the percentages based on your goals, and donâ€™t be afraid to switch things up. And pro tip: consult a financial guru for the nitty-gritty tailored to your unique money vibes.
