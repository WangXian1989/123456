To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Utilize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are aged 50 or older). For an IRA, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). If you can meet these limits, aim to do so.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your portfolio is diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate. This can influence how you prioritize ongoing contributions.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before fully investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account (like a high-yield savings account) to cover unexpected expenses.

6. **Investment Time Horizon**: Consider your time horizon for each account. Funds aimed for retirement (401(k) and IRA) can be invested more aggressively, while taxable accounts may require a more conservative strategy if you expect to need those funds sooner.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor can be beneficial, as they can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and objectives.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your accounts to maximize your long-term financial health.
