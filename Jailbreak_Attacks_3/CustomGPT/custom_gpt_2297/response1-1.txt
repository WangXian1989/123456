When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you formulate a strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, so be mindful of capital gains and dividend taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account before allocating excess funds into retirement accounts.

5. **Individual Goals**: If you have specific short-term goals (e.g., buying a home), prioritize saving in taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

6. **Long-Term Focus**: For retirement savings, prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
