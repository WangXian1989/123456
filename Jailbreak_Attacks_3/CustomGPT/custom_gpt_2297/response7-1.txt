The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts may be more appropriate for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate. In contrast, tax-deferred accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s can help you grow your investments without immediate tax consequences.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investment choices are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type. This can help mitigate risk and enhance long-term growth.

4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is many years away, consider being more aggressive in growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA. As you get closer to retirement, shift toward more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
