Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to guide you in making an informed decision:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: A retirement account offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Primarily for retirement savings, IRAs come in two main types: Traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid on withdrawal) and Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: General investment accounts where you pay taxes on any gains, dividends, or interest earned.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Each account has specific contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). For IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Ensure youâ€™re aware of these limits when planning your contributions.

3. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize investing enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating funds elsewhere.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributing to a traditional 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, use retirement accounts for long-term, growth-oriented investments since they benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals. Consider using taxable accounts for more liquid investments that you may need to access before retirement.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach, consider speaking with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ultimately working toward your financial goals.
