To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (€6,500 max, or €7,500 if over 50) and 401(k) (€22,500 max, or €30,000 if over 50).
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide if a Roth (after-tax) or Traditional (pre-tax) approach fits your tax situation.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which may have lower tax rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity outside of these accounts for unforeseen expenses.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution based on market changes and personal circumstances.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
