I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's important you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help liver health. Avoid processed foods, high-fat, and sugary items.
   - **Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can aid liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping up with regular medical check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to discuss these options with your healthcare provider for the best course of action.
