To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement plans, major purchases, and emergency funds.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as 401(k); traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth (after-tax contributions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year it is received. Itâ€™s suitable for short-term goals or for funds you may need access to before retirement.

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, focusing on traditional or Roth options based on your income and tax situation.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) for a diversified mix of stock and bond funds.
   - In your IRA, you could add different assets or risk levels to complement your 401(k).
   - Keep more volatile investments in taxable accounts, allowing you to strategically manage capital gains and losses.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have enough in taxable accounts for emergencies while maximizing tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies aligned with your financial situation and goals.

**Three questions for further discussion**:
1. What are your primary financial goals in the short and long term?
2. How comfortable are you with risks associated with different investment types?
3. Are you currently contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, and if so, are you maximizing those contributions?
