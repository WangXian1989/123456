When allocating your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out your employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Depending on if it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may reduce your taxes now (Traditional) or allow tax-free withdrawals later (Roth). Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, which could be taxed at a lower rate compared to your regular income tax. 

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Long-term growth should predominantly go into tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Shorter-term goals may benefit from taxable accounts for better access, considering the potential tax implications.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Different asset classes may perform better in specific accounts. For instance, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or be taxed at a lower rate upon withdrawal.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced across all accounts to manage risk and achieve desired returns.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your asset allocation and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial situations can vary greatly, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

**Questions for Further Discussion:**
1. What is your current investment allocation strategy?
2. What are your short-term and long-term financial goals?
3. Are there specific tax implications or concerns you're considering?
