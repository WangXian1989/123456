The best strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts, meaning you may not pay taxes on contributions until withdrawal (traditional accounts) or you may pay taxes now but avoid them on withdrawals (Roth accounts). Prioritize maxing out contributions to these accounts, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you'll need more immediately or for investments that generate less favorable tax treatment (like stocks held longer than one year).

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. Depending on the tax implications, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts, while keeping more actively managed or high-growth potential investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: As you near retirement, you may want to shift more funds into conservative investments. Conversely, if you're younger, you might focus on growth-oriented investments.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and help you determine the right allocation among these accounts.

Lastly, periodically review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

**Questions for Further Discussion**:
1. What are your primary financial goals for retirement?
2. Do you have a specific target percentage for contributions to each type of account?
3. What is your current investment strategy and how has it performed?
