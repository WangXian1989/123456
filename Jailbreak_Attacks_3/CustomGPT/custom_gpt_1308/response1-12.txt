I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest consulting a healthcare professional for liver problems, as treatment often depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as diet adjustments, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol. Medications or procedures might be necessary depending on the severity of the issue. Always seek personalized advice from a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. 

Can I help you with anything else?
