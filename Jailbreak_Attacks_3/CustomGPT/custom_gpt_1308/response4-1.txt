To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions are made pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Available in traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (after-tax) options; both have different tax implications at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested in after-tax money; no tax advantages but more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to capture the full match. This is effectively "free money" added to your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate). The 401(k) may have limited investment options, so choose the best available.

5. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while for IRAs, it is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Align your distribution strategy with your expected retirement timeline. The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want your investments to be.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

8. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds during retirement. This will help you determine which accounts to prioritize in your contribution strategy.

**Three Questions for Further Discussion**:
1. What is your current age and how far are you from retirement?
2. What are your long-term financial goals, and how do you define retirement security?
3. Are you currently maximizing contributions to any of these accounts or facing any limitations?
