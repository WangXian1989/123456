When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account various factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s an approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, a Roth IRA or traditional IRA can offer tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after maximizing your IRA contributions.

3. **Assess Taxes on Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type. Generally, funds in tax-deferred accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA) are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn, while Roth IRA funds can be withdrawn tax-free.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Look into the investment choices available in each account type:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited options but often include low-cost funds.
   - IRAs generally offer a wider range of investment choices including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.
   - Taxable accounts give full freedom to choose investments but don't offer tax benefits.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to minimize risk and optimize returns.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in these accounts, ensure you have a liquid emergency fund to cover unforeseen expenses, typically 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals. Prioritize retirement savings while also considering your current cash flow needs and other financial responsibilities.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation and help you manage investments effectively.
