I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems depend on the underlying condition. Generally, lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight can be beneficial. Medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In some cases, more invasive treatments like surgery or liver transplantation may be necessary. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan and accurate diagnosis.
