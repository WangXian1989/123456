Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any company match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches, maximize contributions here first. Check the investment options and fees.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA after your 401(k) match. Choose a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on:
   - **Dividend Stocks**: Prefer investments that are more tax-efficient.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Hold investments long enough to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may trigger taxes. Plan withdrawals strategically, especially in retirement.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
