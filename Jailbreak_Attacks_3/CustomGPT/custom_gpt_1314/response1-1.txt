Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. These can be useful for short-term goals or as a place to hold investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Assess the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account type in retirement, as this will affect how much you’ll pay in taxes overall.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, rebalancing as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
