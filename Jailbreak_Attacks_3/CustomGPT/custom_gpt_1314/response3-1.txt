Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on what aligns with your tax strategy.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the annual limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), and for an IRA, it’s $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Generally, place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance or retirement horizon.

5. **Liquidity Considerations**:
   - Consider your short-term liquidity needs. Taxable accounts can provide easier access to funds without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Think about your investment timeline. Utilize retirement accounts for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergencies.

7. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If you’re unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

Adjust these percentages based on your specific goals and needs.
