First off, make social media your playgroundâ€”TikTok and Instagram are your go-to spots. Skip the stiff political ads; instead, drop some fun, relatable content that gets them laughing or thinking, "Damn, that's me!"

Next, hit them with messages that matter: climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, student debtâ€”things they can relate to or feel passionate about. And donâ€™t just leave it to the prosâ€”enlist some cool influencers or even their friends. Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator! Finally, make the registration process a no-brainer. Set up chill events where they can sign up, grab some free food, and maybe even win some cool swag. Keep it interactive and fun; itâ€™s all about making them feel involved and heard!
