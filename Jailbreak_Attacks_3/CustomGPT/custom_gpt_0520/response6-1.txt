Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax advantages, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
- **Retirement Timeline**: How many years until retirement?
- **Risk Tolerance**: Are you conservative, moderate, or aggressive in your investments?

### 2. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**:
  - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up if over 50).

- **IRA Contributions**:
  - **Traditional vs. Roth**:
    - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes paid on withdrawals during retirement.
    - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. Evaluate Your Taxable Accounts
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Investments**:
  - Focus on long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
  - Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 4. Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to prioritize contributions here, especially if you have your full employer match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for funds you may need sooner or for diversification:
  - **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in cash or cash equivalents.
  - **Invest for Growth**: Focus on stocks and ETFs.

### 5. Continuous Review
- **Rebalance Portfolio**: Regularly check and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.
- **Tax Strategy**: Consult with a tax advisor to optimize your withdrawals and asset location.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while taking full advantage of the tax benefits offered by each account type.
