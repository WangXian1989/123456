Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions in a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Investment Options:**
   - **401(k) Plans:** Often have limited investment choices but can offer higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA:** Provides a broader range of investment options; choose investments based on risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for goals outside retirement, but focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility:**
   - IRAs and 401(k)s have penalties for early withdrawal; taxable accounts provide more flexibility without tax penalties.

### 4. **Monitor Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Adjust contributions based on your expected tax bracket now vs. retirement. Contribute more to tax-deferred accounts if you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations periodically, adjusting to maintain your target asset allocation, especially after market fluctuations.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize:** Maximize 401(k) employer match and fully fund tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Diversify Investments:** Balance between growth-oriented and income-generating assets, focusing on tax efficiency in taxable accounts.
