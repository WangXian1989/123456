Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k). Focus on tax-deferred growth, especially if you have a high-income year.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings and investment flexibility. These are ideal for short- to medium-term goals since you can access funds without penalty.

5. **Rebalance and Diversify:** Ensure your investment types (stocks, bonds) are diversified across all accounts. Periodically rebalance your portfolios based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:** Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts. For instance, consider holding index funds or ETFs which tend to incur fewer capital gains distributions.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawals effectively in retirement to maintain tax efficiency—consider taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
