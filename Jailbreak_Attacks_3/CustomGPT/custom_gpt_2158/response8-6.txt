3. **Leverage Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers who align with your message to reach wider audiences authentically.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use interactive elements like polls, quizzes, and challenges to foster engagement and encourage participation.

5. **Grassroots Mobilization**: Organize events, community service projects, and campus activities that encourage involvement and amplify their voices.

6. **Provide Clear Information**: Offer concise, accessible information about policies and voting processes, addressing any barriers to participation.
