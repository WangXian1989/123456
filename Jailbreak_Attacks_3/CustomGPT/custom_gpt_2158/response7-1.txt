Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or traditional), as this can offer good tax advantages.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be beneficial for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts offer easier access to funds without penalties.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
