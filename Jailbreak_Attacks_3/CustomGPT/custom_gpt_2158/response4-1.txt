To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Each has different tax implicationsâ€”Traditional IRAs give you a tax break now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are appropriately allocated based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks can be more suitable for accounts like IRAs, while more conservative investments may be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow as long as possible.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
