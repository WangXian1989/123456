Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since withdrawals usually come at retirement, where you have time to weather market fluctuations.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short- to medium-term goals. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds, REITs) in retirement accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like stocks or index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals, which can incur penalties.

### 5. **Regular Re-evaluation:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
