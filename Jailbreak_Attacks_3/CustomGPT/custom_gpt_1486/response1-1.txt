Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2024, the maximum contribution for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before maxing out retirement accounts. The return on paying off debt often outweighs investment gains.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, you can use taxable accounts for additional investing. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments. Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that match your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocations and goals, especially as life circumstances change, such as a new job, marriage, or nearing retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps you take advantage of tax benefits while ensuring you are still preparing for your future financial needs.
