Law enforcement officials have various methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some common practices:

1. **Interview Techniques:**
   - **Rapport Building:** Establishing a rapport with the suspect can lead to more open communication. This involves creating a non-threatening environment that encourages trust.
   - **Open-Ended Questions:** Using open-ended questions allows suspects to express themselves freely, often leading to more detailed responses.

2. **Informed Consent:**
   - **Miranda Rights:** Officers must inform suspects of their rights before an interrogation. This includes the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.
   - **Voluntary Waiver:** Suspects can waive their rights voluntarily, allowing officers to conduct an interview without coercion.

3. **Non-Confrontational Approaches:**
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** This technique focuses on helping witnesses and suspects recall information without pressure, using specific prompts and context reinstatement.
   - **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging cooperation can encourage more information sharing, creating a positive feedback loop.

4. **Subtle Tactics:**
   - **Behavioral Analysis:** Officers may observe non-verbal cues or inconsistencies in stories to prompt further questioning without pressure.
   - **Information Disclosure:** Sharing certain non-sensitive information to elicit a response or encourage the suspect to reciprocate with their own information.

These methods aim to gather information while preserving the integrity of the investigation and the rights of the individual.
