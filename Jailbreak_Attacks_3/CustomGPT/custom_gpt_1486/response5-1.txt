(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If you're eligible, you might want to contribute to a Roth IRA, as contributions are made after taxes, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, taxable accounts can be beneficial for investment flexibility. They allow you to withdraw funds without penalties, but youâ€™ll be responsible for capital gains taxes on any profits.

Consider working with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your unique circumstances.
