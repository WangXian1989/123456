Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a balanced approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the limit is $23,000, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Pre-Tax or Roth**: Decide whether to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your current vs. anticipated future tax bracket.

3. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose based on your tax strategy—traditional IRAs may lower taxable income now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Income Limits**: Be mindful of income limits for Roth contributions and tax deductibility for traditional IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that are expected to generate significant taxable income (e.g., bonds, certain stocks). This can help you manage capital gains tax through tax-loss harvesting.
   - Flexibility in withdrawals (no penalties for accessing funds).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating investments in taxable accounts for potential capital gains treatment.

7. **Regular Review**: 
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If unsure, consult with a financial professional to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By balancing contributions across these account types, you can optimize your tax position and support long-term growth.
