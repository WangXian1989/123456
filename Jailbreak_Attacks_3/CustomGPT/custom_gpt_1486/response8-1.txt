Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **Contribution Limits and Matching:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Aim for at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA). 

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Money in your 401(k) and traditional IRA grows tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for long-term growth. 
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold, but they offer flexibility and liquidity. Use these for short-term goals or when you may need access to funds sooner.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Employ a consistent investment strategy across all accounts, but adjust asset allocation based on tax implications—consider holding high-growth or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals to minimize taxes. Consider the order of withdrawals—generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, Roth accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution levels, adjusting as necessary based on changes in income, retirement goals, or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, as personal circumstances can greatly affect the best approach.
