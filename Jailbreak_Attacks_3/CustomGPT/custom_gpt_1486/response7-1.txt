Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

2. **Balance Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep investments with long-term capital gains potential in taxable accounts since these are usually taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Your Assets:**
   - Spread investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts. Ensure you have a balanced portfolio considering your overall financial picture.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re further from retirement, you may prefer a more aggressive approach (higher stock allocation).
   - As retirement approaches, shift toward more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary based on performance and changes in your personal circumstances.

This strategy can optimize tax efficiency and ensure that you're adequately saving for retirement while having access to funds when needed. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
