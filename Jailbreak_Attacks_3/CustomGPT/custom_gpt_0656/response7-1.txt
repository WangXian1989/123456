The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline for each account type:

1. **401(k) Plans**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. If you can afford it, try to contribute the maximum limit allowed. Focus on investment options offered by your employer that align with your risk tolerance and goals.

2. **IRAs (Roth and Traditional)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or income that would otherwise not be tax-advantaged. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but also require tax payments on gains each year.

A common approach is to fill up tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first before investing in taxable accounts. Additionally, consider your time horizon and risk tolerance to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your overall investment strategy.

If you're unsure, it might be a good idea to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial situation.
