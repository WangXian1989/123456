I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Treatment may vary based on the specific type of liver issue you're experiencing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. General approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Following a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Incorporating regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications and Supplements**: 
   - Prescription medications for conditions like hepatitis.
   - Vitamins and supplements as advised by a healthcare provider.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging studies like ultrasounds for assessment.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
