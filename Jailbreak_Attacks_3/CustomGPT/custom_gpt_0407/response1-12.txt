I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional who can assess your specific liver condition and suggest appropriate treatment options. Common treatments for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or control the underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of any disease.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider regarding treatments for your liver issues.
