Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money." If possible, aim to maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a Roth option.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. The Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investment vehicles that may generate taxable income. For instance, capital gains from stock sales or dividends can be strategically placed in taxable accounts to manage your overall tax burden.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - Long-term investments (e.g., retirement savings) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts. Short-term needs can be handled through taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different account types may have varied investment goals and risk tolerances.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Revisit Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your contributions as your income changes or as you approach retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances, considering your investment preferences, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

In summary, itâ€™s typically wise to first maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
