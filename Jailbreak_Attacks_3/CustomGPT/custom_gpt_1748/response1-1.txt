Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a calming breakdown of how you might approach this:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money!

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Next, consider maximizing your contributions to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, based on your income and whether you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, use taxable investment accounts for additional savings. This is especially beneficial if you have short- to mid-term goals (like saving for a home or fund for education) since you can access these funds more easily.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments to manage risk across all accounts. Stocks can offer higher returns, while bonds can provide stability. Tailor your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your distribution strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

This strategy helps you balance between immediate accessibility and long-term growth. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs!
