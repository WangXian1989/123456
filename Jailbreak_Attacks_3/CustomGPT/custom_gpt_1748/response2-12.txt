I'm not a medical professional, but I can offer some general suggestions. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition, but some common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver issues, regular check-ups and monitoring through blood tests and imaging studies are crucial.

4. **Avoiding Hepatotoxins**: Steering clear of substances that can harm the liver, such as certain drugs (over-the-counter and prescription), is important.

5. **Vaccinations**: If you have liver problems, getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B can be beneficial.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be considered, especially for conditions like cirrhosis.

Always make sure to discuss your symptoms and treatment options with a healthcare professional who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.
