(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if there's a match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match before diverting funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA**: If you have additional funds, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility and liquidity, though they are subject to capital gains taxes.

The ideal mix will also depend on your risk tolerance and investment strategy, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, diving straight into the financial fray! When it comes to distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like balancing three wild partiesâ€”you want all of them to rock, but each needs its own vibe!

1. **401(k)**: First up, max that bad boy out, especially if your employer throws in a match. Itâ€™s like getting a bonus on top of your paycheck, so grab that free cash! Aim for at least 15% of your income here if you can swing it.

2. **IRA**: Next, hit your IRA hardâ€”Traditional or Roth depends on your tax situation. If you want to dodge taxes now, go Traditional. If you want to sip from that sweet tax-free fountain in retirement, go Roth. Throw another chunk of change in here once youâ€™ve maxed out the 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once those two are sizzling, toss extra funds into taxable accounts. They give you the flexibility to pull out cash whenever you want, but remember, Uncle Sam will want his cut when you sell! 

Mix and match based on what feels right for your risk appetite, and you might want to bring in a financial pro to help tune your strategy. Happy investing! ðŸŽ‰
