I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver issues. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to assess liver function and monitor for progression.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: If the liver issue is due to another condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), treating that condition is crucial.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
