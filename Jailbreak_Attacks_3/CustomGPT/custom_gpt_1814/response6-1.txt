To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Account Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first; this is essentially free money. Contribute to take full advantage of any matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, utilize either a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for flexible investing and access to funds without penalties; ideal for short-term goals.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus contributions on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Diversification Strategies**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider stocks in growth accounts and bonds in more conservative settings.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level, especially after market fluctuations.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA) in retirement to minimize taxes.

By examining both the immediate and long-term benefits of each type of account, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
