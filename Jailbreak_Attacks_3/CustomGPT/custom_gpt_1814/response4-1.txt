To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. This can provide additional tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties (though capital gains taxes may apply).

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Within your 401(k) and IRAs, select tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions.
   - In taxable accounts, consider municipal bonds or tax-managed funds to reduce tax liability.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. This might mean having a more aggressive or growth-oriented approach in tax-advantaged accounts, while opting for more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and contributions, especially following changes in income, expenses, life events, or market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to align your strategy with your personal financial goals and circumstances.
