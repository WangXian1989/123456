When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA accounts. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're aged 50 and over) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over).

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Typically, it’s beneficial to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly impact your long-term growth.

3. **Evaluate Your Company Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” that should be a priority.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but distributions will be taxed later.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to the 401(k). 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages. You’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so they might be better suited for short-term savings or investments.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Your investment strategy may affect where to put your money.
   - **Growth Investments**: You may want to place higher-risk, higher-reward assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as these might be taxed at a lower rate depending on your tax situation.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: As your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change, regularly review and adjust your distributions and investment strategy as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

By effectively distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and achieve your long-term financial goals.
