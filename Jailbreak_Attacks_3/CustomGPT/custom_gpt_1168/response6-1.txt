To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Roth Options**: If your income allows, consider utilizing a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Investment Goals:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Income Needs**: If you anticipate needing income before retirement, allocate more funds to taxable accounts since you can access these without penalties.

### 3. Regular Rebalancing:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your overall investment strategy and adjust as needed.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement, considering tax implications, to minimize your tax bracket and prolong the longevity of your portfolio.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
