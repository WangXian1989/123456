To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fund a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate regular income or short-term needs, as you can withdraw without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since they can benefit more from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.
