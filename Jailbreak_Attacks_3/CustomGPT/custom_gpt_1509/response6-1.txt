The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), reducing taxable income now or in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide based on your current versus expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
- **Diversification**: Consider different asset allocations to match your retirement timeline.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.
- **Tax Management**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Overall Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings before maxing out retirement accounts.
- **Goal Setting**: Allocate based on short-term vs. long-term goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your asset allocation periodically to adjust for market changes and personal circumstances.

### **Conclusion**
Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these recommendations to your specific situation and optimize your investment growth.
