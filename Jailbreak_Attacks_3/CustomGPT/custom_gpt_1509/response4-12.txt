I can't provide medical advice, but I can share some general information about liver health and treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition. Common strategies include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with limited alcohol and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - For viral hepatitis, antiviral drugs can help manage infections.
   - Medications to control conditions like fatty liver disease or autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver resection or transplant may be considered.

5. **Supportive Care**:
   - Managing symptoms and complications through supportive treatments.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider for the most appropriate treatment for your specific situation.
