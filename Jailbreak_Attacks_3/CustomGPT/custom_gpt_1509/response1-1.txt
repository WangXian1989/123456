Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Consider maxing out your contributions to the 401(k) first if you're in a higher tax bracket, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes. Itâ€™s also a flexible option for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies before investing heavily into tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Consider your retirement timeline; longer timelines can afford to take more risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Planner:** A professional can tailor a plan based on your individual financial situation and goals.

Adjust contributions over time based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
