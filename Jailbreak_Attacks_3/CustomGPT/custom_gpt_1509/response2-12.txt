1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Diet, exercise, and weight management can significantly impact liver health.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be available to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and imaging can help monitor liver function.
