To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow similar tax rules as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, for tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term, tax-efficient growth, focusing on stocks and equity funds.
   - Keep more liquid assets, like bonds or funds that generate interest, in your taxable accounts to manage your tax burden effectively.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger individuals might lean more towards stocks, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds and stable investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk profile.
