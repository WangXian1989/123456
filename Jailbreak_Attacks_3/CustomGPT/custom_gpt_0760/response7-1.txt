To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, typically in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax when sold, which can impact your overall returns.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals:**
   - If you’re focused on retirement, prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first.
   - For shorter-term goals (less than 5 years), consider using a taxable account for more liquidity.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

### 4. **Balance Contributions:**
   - After the employer match, decide between further contributions to your 401(k) or maximizing your IRA contributions (especially if you can qualify for a Roth IRA).

### 5. **Risk Management:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account to spread risk. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (consider a Roth IRA if eligible).
- **Taxable Account:** Use any additional funds or when you’ve maxed retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
Creating a balanced approach that incorporates tax implications, personal goals, and risk tolerance is key. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
