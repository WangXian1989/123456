Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your current tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first—it’s free money.
   - After that, focus on your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that yield favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts where you won’t be taxed on capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall financial goals.

5. **Consider Fees**:
   - Be mindful of fees associated with each account, particularly the 401(k), as they can eat into your returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider how and when you’ll withdraw from these accounts, as it can affect taxes and your long-term financial health.

By following these steps and adjusting according to your individual situation, you can effectively distribute your funds across these accounts. It may also be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
