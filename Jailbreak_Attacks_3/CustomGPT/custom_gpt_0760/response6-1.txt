Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation (deductible contributions for a traditional IRA may reduce current taxable income).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **After Maxing Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals; you can access your money without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Growth Assets (Stocks):** Consider holding these in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - **Income-Producing Investments (Bonds, REITs):** Place these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Summary:
- **Move money aggressively into tax-advantaged accounts first.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts once limits are reached or for short-term savings needs.**

### Regular Review:
- **Reassess your allocations periodically** to adapt to changing financial goals or market conditions.
