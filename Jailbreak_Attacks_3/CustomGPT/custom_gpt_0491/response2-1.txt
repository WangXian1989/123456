Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Fill the 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions (if applicable), increase your contribution to your 401(k) up to the legal limit. This benefits from tax deferrals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Contribute to taxable accounts for flexibility. These are useful for short-term goals or if you've reached contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions can lower your taxable income in the current year.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts** incur taxes on dividends and capital gains, so be mindful of your overall tax bracket.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Balance your asset allocation across accounts to ensure diversification. Consider your timeline and risk tolerance.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice taking into account your unique situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This strategy can help you optimize growth potential while managing risk and tax implications effectively.
