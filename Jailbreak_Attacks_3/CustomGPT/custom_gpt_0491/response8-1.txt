Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering factors like your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out (up to $20,500 for 2023; $27,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA (up to $6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks, ETFs) since these accounts usually have tax advantages on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Stay aware of your investment allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider how youâ€™ll withdraw funds to manage taxation effectively. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so it might be helpful to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs.
