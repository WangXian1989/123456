Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the benefits and taxation of each. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum limit if your budget allows.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - Look at your tax bracket to decide which type of IRA gives you the best tax advantage.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies, as these accounts are more accessible without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax impact, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation across accounts aligns with your overall investment strategy, considering risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on performance, tax changes, and personal financial goals.

This strategy should help optimize your investments while considering tax implications and access needs.
