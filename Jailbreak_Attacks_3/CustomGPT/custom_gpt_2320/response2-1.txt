The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) next. IRAs often have tax advantages that can benefit your savings over time.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you've maximized your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit), you can go back to contributing more to your 401(k) if your employer allows additional contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into a taxable account. This offers more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices, though it won't provide the same tax benefits.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax situation. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be more beneficial, as withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Diversification of Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes to help mitigate risk.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**: As your income, expenses, and financial goals change, periodically reassess your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your current situation and long-term objectives.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice to optimize your investment strategy based on your unique circumstances.
