Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to maximize growth while managing risk and tax implications. Here are several strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Benefits**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially “free money” and helps reduce your taxable income.
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you're eligible, as contributions may be tax-deductible, further reducing your taxable income.
   - If you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals (e.g., retirement, home purchase, etc.). Longer-term goals can tolerate higher risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts, favoring investments that produce lower capital gains and dividends, to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - In taxable accounts, consider using tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to limit capital gains distributions.

By implementing these strategies, you ensure a balanced approach to growing your wealth while considering tax implications and investment objectives. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
