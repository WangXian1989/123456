To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions. Contribute enough to receive the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Understand Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax brackets**: If you’re in a high tax bracket now, favor traditional accounts for immediate tax reductions. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - **Withdrawal strategy**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Asset location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - **Investment choices**: Maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals.

### 4. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
   - Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Future Needs**
   - Think about your future cash needs, like healthcare costs or lifestyle changes in retirement, and plan your distributions accordingly.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out any employer match.
- **IRA**: Fund a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA for tax deduction.
- **Taxable accounts**: Invest any additional savings in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, or funds.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to your retirement savings. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
