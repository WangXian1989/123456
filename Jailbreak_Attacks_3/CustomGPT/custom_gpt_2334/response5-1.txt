Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k), as it effectively offers free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA/ Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.
   
### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond your 401(k) and IRA limits. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 4. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 5. **Reassess Annually**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Get personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.

By following this framework, you can effectively balance your investments across different account types to optimize for growth while considering tax implications.
