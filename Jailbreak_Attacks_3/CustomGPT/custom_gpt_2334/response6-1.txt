When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits, either through tax deferrals or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, while holding growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual contribution limit; maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to both a traditional and a Roth IRA to diversify your tax strategy.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) are better suited for long-term tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments may work well in taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all account types to balance risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impacts, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

### Conclusion
Assess your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline to determine the best allocation strategy. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
