Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed annually, so they’re often used for more flexible, short-term savings.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account type. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:**
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth because you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal (or not at all for Roth accounts).
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term or flexible savings, keeping in mind the tax implications on gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can give personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investment growth while managing tax impacts.
