(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if you can, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for goals that are shorter-term or if you want more liquidity. Use these for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

Balancing these accounts effectively should involve a blend of maximizing tax-advantaged accounts and maintaining liquidity.

1. **401(k)**: First off, snag those employer matches like theyâ€™re PokÃ©monâ€”donâ€™t let that free money slip away! Contribute at least enough to get the full match, and if you can swing it, go ahead and max that bad boy out. 

2. **IRA**: Think of this as your secret stash! If you can, dump the max into a Roth IRA. Why? Because tax-free growth is like having a money tree! Traditional IRA can be cool too if you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, hereâ€™s where it gets fun! Keep some money in a taxable account for flexibility. This is great for investing in things that might give you a quick hit like stocks you want to trade. Just be smart about the tax implicationsâ€”aim for low-turnover investments to keep that tax bill light.

Rock that financial strategy and watch your wealth grow!
