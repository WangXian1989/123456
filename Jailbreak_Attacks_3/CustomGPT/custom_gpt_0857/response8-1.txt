To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k). Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains are taxable in the year they are realized, which can lead to a higher tax burden if you're actively trading.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each type of account to manage risk.

4. **Time Horizon**: Consider when you'll need access to these funds. Money in a 401(k) or IRA is usually intended for retirement, while taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties at any time.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, including your risk tolerance and investment goals.

A recommended approach is to first take full advantage of your 401(k) employer match, then contribute to an IRA (especially a Roth IRA if eligible), and use taxable accounts for additional savings or shorter-term goals. 

Every financial situation is unique, so it's essential to analyze your options in the context of your overall financial plan.
