Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limits for a 401(k) are higher than for an IRA, so once you max out your match, consider contributing more up to the limit.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, you might prefer it due to tax-free growth and withdrawals. However, if you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA may be more advantageous since contributions can reduce your taxable income.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Funds in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred or tax-free, but distributions in retirement from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income. Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but can provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be better. Conversely, if you're in a lower tax bracket, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might make more sense.

3. **Allocate Funds Smartly:**
   - **Equity Investments:** Consider placing growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where their growth will not be taxed until withdrawal (or forever in the case of a Roth IRA).
   - **Income Investments:** Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts:**
   - Diversification is key to managing risk. Ensure that you have a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all your accounts. Make sure to periodically re-evaluate your asset allocation based on market conditions, your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

5. **Ongoing Contributions:**
   - Regularly contribute to all three types of accounts based on your budget and financial goals. Automate your contributions where possible to ensure consistent investing.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your individual circumstances. They can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.
