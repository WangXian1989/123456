Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Retirement Account Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax advantages of each account type. Traditional 401(k) and IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so it might be wise to hold investments there that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for a lower tax rate.

3. **Diversify Investment Types**:
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, while keeping less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're further from retirement, you might lean more heavily into stocks in all accounts for growth. As retirement approaches, gradually shift to more conservative investments, particularly in taxable accounts where you may need quicker access to funds.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Once your accounts are set up, make it a habit to review your asset allocation periodically (at least annually) and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - As you approach retirement, think strategically about which accounts to withdraw from first to minimize taxes and maximize sustainability of your retirement income.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
