Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (often referred to as "free money"). Then, consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Maxing out your IRA after your 401(k) is often beneficial.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may not have favorable tax treatment in retirement accounts (such as stocks). This allows for capital gains tax treatment.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth or deferred taxes. Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications better.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Factor in Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider strategies for withdrawing funds from these accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a personalized strategy based on your unique situation.
