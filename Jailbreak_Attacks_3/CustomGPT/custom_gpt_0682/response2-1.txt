Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your income and tax situation, decide whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) is better for you.
   - **Contribution Limit**: The limit for 2024 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund & Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. This can also include investments for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment choices based on your risk tolerance. Generally, a more aggressive allocation is suitable for long-term retirement accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - **Regular Review**: Review your asset allocation and contributions annually to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - **Rebalance**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions first to benefit from any employer match.
2. Next, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA up to the maximum limit.
3. Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account, focusing on long-term investments that favor tax efficiency.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.
