To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible (the limit for 2024 is $23,000 plus catch-up contributions if applicable).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA next (the limit for 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older). Choose between traditional or Roth based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
  
2. **Evaluate Investment Options**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate higher taxes, like actively managed funds or high-yield bonds. 
   - Consider holding lower turnover investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged options, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. Here, prefer tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Consider Withdrawal Timing**:
   - Think about how you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Account for the tax implications of withdrawals and required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.

5. **Reassess Annually**:
   - Review your distribution strategy annually, especially as your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide valuable insights.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
