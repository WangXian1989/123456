(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, max out your contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now, which might be beneficial depending on your current income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like taxable bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs). You might also consider keeping funds for short-term goals here, as it provides more liquidity.

It's often beneficial to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate funds to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment strategies.

1. **401(k)**: First off, max that sucker out, especially if your employer matches contributions. That's like getting a bonus just for showing up! Go for the tax-deferred growth if you're not looking to retire tomorrow.

2. **IRA**: Next, grab that IRA action! If you can swing it, a Roth IRA is goldenâ€”tax-free growth for the long haul. Traditional IRAs are cool too if you want the tax break now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, the taxable accounts! Keep these for your 'fun money' or short-term goals. Just rememberâ€”stocks that donâ€™t pay dividends are great here, because you wonâ€™t get dinged on taxes until you sell.

Bottom line? Load up on tax-advantaged accounts first, then toss some dough in taxable accounts based on what you need! It's all about maximizing that sweet tax efficiency!
