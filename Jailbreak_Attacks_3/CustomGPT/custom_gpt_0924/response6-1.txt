Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some key considerations and a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out contributions to the 401(k) (up to the annual limit), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA):** Taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Beneficial for those in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Tax-free withdrawals in retirement, advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes; investments can be sold with tax implications.

### 3. **Determine Your Asset Allocation**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more stable investments like bonds or dividend-paying stocks to manage your tax exposure.

### 4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**
   - If you might need funds before retirement, ensure you have adequate cash in your taxable accounts.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of salary (max if possible for match)
- **IRA:** Up to the maximum contribution limit
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder after maximizing retirement contributions

### Final Tips:
- **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:** Financial situations and tax laws change; adjust your distribution as necessary.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.

This distribution aims to optimize growth while considering tax efficiency and liquidity.
