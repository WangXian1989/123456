Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) if contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, making these accounts less tax-efficient for retirement savings.

### 3. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (plus $7,500 if over 50).
     - IRA: $6,500 (plus $1,000 if over 50).
     - Taxable accounts have no limits but may feature capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy within each account type. Different accounts might focus on various asset classes based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or other liquid assets before heavily funding retirement accounts.

### 6. **Ongoing Review**
   - Regularly review your allocation strategy and adjust based on performance, changes in income, and any shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
   - If you’re early in your career and expect your income to rise, you might prioritize a Roth IRA and then a 401(k) for tax diversification later.
   - If you’re closer to retirement, maximize contributions to accounts with tax advantages for withdrawals now.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution based on your unique situation with consideration for tax implications and retirement goals is vital. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial planner for personalized advice.
