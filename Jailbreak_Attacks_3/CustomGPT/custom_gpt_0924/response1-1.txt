Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Maximize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Use these for shorter-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

### 3. **Investment Horizon**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - For shorter-term goals or emergencies, having funds in a taxable account can provide quicker access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced investment across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash).
   - Consider how your investments are spread in each account type to optimize tax efficiency and liquidity.

### 5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger individuals might favor aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your contributions and investment performance to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match + 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Contribute enough to maximize allowable limit (currently $6,500/year or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Start after maximizing retirement accounts or if you have specific short-term goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
