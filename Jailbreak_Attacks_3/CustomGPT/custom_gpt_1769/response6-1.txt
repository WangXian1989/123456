Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your investment distribution:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth; employer match should be maximized.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages; consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your needs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; offers flexibility and access without penalties before retirement age.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax deduction benefits if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth Options**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for money that you may need access to before retirement, understanding that capital gains taxes will apply when you sell investments for profit.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**:
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquidity in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more towards your 401(k) and IRA for potential compounding growth.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Distribute investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type to balance risk.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to changing financial situations or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, e.g., 10%
- **Fund IRA**: Aim for the maximum annual contribution, e.g., 6%
- **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Use remaining funds or after-tax income, e.g., 4%

### Conclusion
By prioritizing tax-deferred growth while ensuring access to funds for short-term needs, you can achieve a balanced distribution that aligns with your broader financial objectives. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
