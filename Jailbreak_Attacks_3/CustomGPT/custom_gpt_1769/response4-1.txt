Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. This account allows you to grow your investments tax-deferred until withdrawal, typically in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider funding these accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA), where contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, growth assets (like stocks) are better suited for accounts with tax advantages, while more conservative assets (like bonds) may be better in taxable accounts due to lower capital gains tax if held long-term.

4. **Balance Taxable Accounts Last:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts more freely. Here, consider investing in lower-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations and contributions regularly, especially as your income, expenses, and tax situation changes over time.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, the “best” distribution will depend on your specific goals, current tax obligations, and long-term financial plans.
