The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions to Employer-Sponsored Plans:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After securing the match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or a Roth IRA. The contribution limits for IRAs may be lower than those for 401(k)s, but they offer tax benefits that can be advantageous.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets:**
   - Distributing your money based on your current tax bracket can be effective. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals:**
   - If your investment timeline is long (15 years or more), you might be more aggressive in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, consider keeping more liquid assets in your taxable account.

5. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure your investment options within each account are diversified. This way, you can take advantage of different asset types while managing risk.

6. **Account for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):**
   - Remember that 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts require RMDs starting at age 72. If you expect to need your retirement funds earlier, plan accordingly.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure how to optimize your distribution strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

9. **Be Mindful of Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for potential withdrawals in retirement. Typically, taxable accounts might be tapped first for immediate cash needs, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

It's essential to remember that financial strategies should be personalized based on individual circumstances, including risk tolerance and long-term goals. Regularly reviewing and adjusting your distribution strategy will help you best manage your investments over time.
