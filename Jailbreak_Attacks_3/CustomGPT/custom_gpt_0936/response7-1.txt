To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, with a maximum contribution limit of $6,500 in 2024 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income for the year. Conversely, Roth IRAs and taxable accounts provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where taxes on interest can affect overall returns.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally after age 70½ from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual’s financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can help tailor your strategy based on your financial goals, current savings, and expected future needs.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to enhance your overall financial growth and tax efficiency.
