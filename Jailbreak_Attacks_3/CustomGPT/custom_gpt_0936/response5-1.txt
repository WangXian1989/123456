To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approaches:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - Start with your 401(k). If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Decide which type aligns with your long-term tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider these for short-term goals or as a flexible investment vehicle, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Allocate higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that may generate income, as you'll pay taxes on dividends and interest income.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance regularly to keep your asset allocation in line with your desired strategy.

### 5. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure that part of your savings is in taxable accounts for easy access in case of emergencies or short-term financial needs.

### 6. **Retirement Timeline:**
   - Your age and expected retirement date play significant roles. Younger investors may prioritize growth in 401(k)s and IRAs, while those approaching retirement may focus on stability and income generation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals, ensuring an optimal distribution across your investment accounts.
