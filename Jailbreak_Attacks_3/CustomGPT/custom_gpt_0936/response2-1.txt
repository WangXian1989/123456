Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially “free money” and should be your first priority.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you’re eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Both have tax advantages that can be beneficial over the long term. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

### 3. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so there’s no immediate tax benefit, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**
   - If you have shorter-term financial goals (like buying a home or funding education in less than five years), prioritize your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### 5. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Match your investment choices within each account to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, market conditions, and any life changes.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 10-15% of your salary (max out to employer match)
- IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50) if eligible
- Taxable accounts: Any remaining funds, especially if you need liquidity.

### Note:
- Adjust based on your specific circumstances (age, income, retirement timeline).
- Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
