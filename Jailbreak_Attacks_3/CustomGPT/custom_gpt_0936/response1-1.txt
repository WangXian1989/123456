Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Enough for Tax Benefits**: 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income, which can be beneficial, especially in higher tax brackets.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA for Tax-Free Growth**: If you qualify, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for future tax-free withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA for Deductible Contributions**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for goals within the next few years, or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.
   - **Diversification**: Taxable accounts can hold assets that might not fit well into tax-advantaged accounts, like real estate or certain types of investments with unique tax strategies.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Diversify**: Spread your investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to mitigate risks.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust allocations to maintain desired risk levels as you approach retirement.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Understand how withdrawals from each account will be taxed in retirement to strategize distributions effectively.
- **Investment Choices**: Choose appropriate investments for each account type based on your investment horizon and risk tolerance.
