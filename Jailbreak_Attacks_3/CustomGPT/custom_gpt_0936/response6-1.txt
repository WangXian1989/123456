To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money.
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Analyze Your Tax Situation**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Gains:** Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so keep investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Consider utilizing losses in your taxable accounts to offset gains, improving your overall tax efficiency.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Based on Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Focus on mutual funds or target-date funds that provide diversified exposure.
   - **IRA:** Incorporate a mix of stocks and bonds; consider individual stocks for more aggressive growth or bond ETFs for safety.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize turnover and avoid high-fee investments.

### 4. **Maintain Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as 401(k) and IRA funds are often locked until retirement age.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually or after significant life events to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

By strategically balancing contributions across these accounts based on tax implications and investment goals, you can optimize your financial growth and minimize tax liabilities.
