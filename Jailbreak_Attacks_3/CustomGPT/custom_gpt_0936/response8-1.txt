Distributing money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your financial growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions ($22,500 for 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50+).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts can be beneficial. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Current vs. Future Income:** Use your taxable account for investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) and hold growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or minimize taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Match your contributions based on your risk tolerance across different accounts. You might want higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts for balanced risk and growth opportunities.

### 4. **Continuous Contributions:**
   - **Automate Contributions:** Set up automatic transfers to ensure regular contributions to all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust:**
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and retirement timeline.
   - **Tax Law Changes:** Keep informed about tax law changes that might affect contributions and withdrawals.

### Conclusion:
A well-structured strategy involving tax-advantaged accounts and careful consideration of your tax situation will help you optimize your wealth accumulation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
