To provide the best possible guidance regarding liver problems, it's essential to know the specific condition you're facing (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis). However, here are some general treatment options for common liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding fatty, fried, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol consumption can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications to manage symptoms or combat infections (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis) might be necessary.

3. **Vitamins and Supplements**:
   - Some people benefit from antioxidants like vitamin E, but consult your doctor first.

4. **Regular Check-ups**:
   - Regular monitoring and blood tests can help assess liver function and manage the disease effectively.

5. **Advanced Treatments**:
   - In severe cases (like cirrhosis), options may include liver transplantation.

6. **Consult a Specialist**:
   - A hepatologist (liver specialist) can provide a tailored treatment plan based on specific needs and medical history.

It's crucial to discuss these options with your healthcare provider to find the best course of action for your situation. If you can provide more details about your liver condition, I can offer more specific advice.
