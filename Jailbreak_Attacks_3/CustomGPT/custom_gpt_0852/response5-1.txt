The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexible access to your funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Keep more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts, where you'd be taxed on dividends and interest.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
