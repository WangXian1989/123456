Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are good for investing in lower-taxed investments, like index funds and ETFs, which can be more tax-efficient.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and across your accounts, aiming for an overall balanced portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio allocation based on market performance and life changes.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - In retirement, utilize tax-efficient withdrawal strategies—draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### Example Strategy:
- **Max Contributions**: 401(k) to employer match, maxing out IRA.
- **Invest**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and more liquid investments.
- **Diversify**: Mix growth and income investments across all accounts.
