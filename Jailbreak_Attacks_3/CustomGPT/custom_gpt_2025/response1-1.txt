Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available; itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax strategy. 

3. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account (typically not part of your retirement accounts).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term or for investments that generate lower taxable income (like ETFs or index funds).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment choices in each account based on your risk tolerance. Generally, consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and more conservative investments in taxable accounts due to tax implications.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. For example, consider the tax implications of withdrawing from different accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice suited to your specific situation.
