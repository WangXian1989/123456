Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Consider contributing the maximum if you are far from retirement, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, you might consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth but have income limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially beneficial if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Consider having bonds in taxable accounts for tax efficiency, while holding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial planner.

This approach aims to optimize growth while minimizing tax liability over time.
