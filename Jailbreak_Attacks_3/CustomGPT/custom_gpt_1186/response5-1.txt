Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your current tax situation and income level. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Investment Choices:**
   - In retirement accounts, you might have a limited selection of investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.
   - For taxable accounts, you can take advantage of tax-loss harvesting and have a more flexible investment strategy.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Investments that produce ordinary income (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) are often best held in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes. 
   - Capital gains from stocks can be held in taxable accounts since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across accounts. This will help you manage risk and ensure that you’re not overly dependent on one type of investment.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations over time to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Consider how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as income, while Roth accounts and taxable accounts offer more flexibility and potential tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, it’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation. This approach helps you optimize your distribution across your investment accounts.
