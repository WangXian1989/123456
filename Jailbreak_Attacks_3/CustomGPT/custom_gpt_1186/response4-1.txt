Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally preferred for funds you'll need access to before retirement age. Capital gains taxes apply here, so consider long-term investments to minimize tax impacts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes. Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Your Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Consider your age and when you plan to retire. Younger investors can usually afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement might prefer safer investments.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on performance and changing life circumstances (job changes, market conditions, etc.).

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your individual goals.

Adjusting your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve is key to effectively managing your investments.
