Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 401(k)
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Aim to contribute at least to this limit if possible.
3. **Investment Options**: Diversify your investments within the 401(k), focusing on a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.

### IRA (Traditional or Roth)
1. **Tax Advantages**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.
2. **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50).
3. **Withdrawal Rules**: Keep in mind the withdrawal penalties for early distributions with Traditional IRAs versus the more flexible rules with Roth IRAs.

### Taxable Accounts
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies in your taxable accounts.
2. **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Hold investments for over a year to qualify for long-term capital gains rates.
3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

### General Strategy
1. **Tax Impact**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. You can withdraw tax-free from a Roth IRA in retirement.
2. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of investments across accounts to reduce overall risk.
3. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Summary
- Start with maxing out your employer's 401(k) match.
- Use IRAs for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- Maintain liquidity and tax efficiency in taxable accounts.
- Adjust your strategy based on your specific financial situation.
