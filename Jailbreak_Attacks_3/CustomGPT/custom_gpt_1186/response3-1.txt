Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is an important strategy for optimizing your retirement savings and tax benefits. Here’s a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s).
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments without specific tax advantages; you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible)**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- **Add to 401(k)**: After maximizing the Roth IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) if it offers good investment options and low fees.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investing, particularly for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Assess Asset Allocation
- **Equities**: Generally best held in taxable accounts due to lower capital gains taxes.
- **Bonds**: More tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts due to higher interest income being taxed at your ordinary rate.
- **Real Estate/REITs**: Often favorable in taxable accounts to shelter rental income through depreciation.

### 4. Review Tax Implications
- **Tax Deferred**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts for less tax drag on growth.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan your withdrawals to manage taxes effectively—withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts, considering your income needs.

### 5. Regularly Reassess
- **Rebalance**: Review your portfolio regularly to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Adjust Contributions**: Change your distribution based on financial goals, contributions limits, age, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
The best strategy combines maximizing employer contributions, utilizing tax advantages effectively, and maintaining a diversified asset allocation. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation.
