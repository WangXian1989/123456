To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs, for instance, offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments to mitigate risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can hold investments that are tax-efficient. For example, consider holding stocks or index funds that may generate lower taxable distributions. Municipal bonds can also be a good option since their interest is often tax-free.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Frame**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals. Long-term goals might benefit more from riskier assets, while short-term goals might require safer investments.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, speaking with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach maximizes tax efficiency and investment growth over time. Always keep your individual circumstances and risk tolerance in mind when making decisions.
