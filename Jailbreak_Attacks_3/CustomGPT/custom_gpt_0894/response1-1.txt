Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a basic approach:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **IRAs**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t maxed out your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute more, especially if your employer offers a match.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you’re contributing the maximum to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. This can be useful for liquidity or goals that are short term.

4. **Asset allocation considerations**: 
   - Generally, hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing and adjustments**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, goals, and changes in your financial situation.

It's recommended to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
