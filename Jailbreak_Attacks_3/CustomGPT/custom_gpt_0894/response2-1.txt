Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you decide:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available (it's essentially free money).
   - **Contribution Limit:** In 2024, the limit is $23,000 (under 50) or $30,000 (50 and older). Aim to maximize contributions if possible.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is suitable if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This works well if you anticipate being in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** In 2024, the limit is $6,500 (under 50) or $7,500 (50 and older). Try to maximize these contributions as well.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use for savings beyond retirement focuses. It allows for more immediate access to funds without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains tax and try to invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize your tax burden.

### **General Strategy:**
1. Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA (choose between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
3. Populate your taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

### **Rebalancing:**
- Regularly assess your contribution strategy as you get closer to retirement or as your financial situation changes. 

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- Consider personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation for more tailored strategies.
