Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Aim to fully fund your IRA if possible. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Best for tax reductions now, ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** More suitable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for investments that generate capital gains rather than income, as long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Investment Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, consider shifting more towards conservative investments to protect your savings.
   - For younger investors, a more aggressive portfolio with higher growth potential might be wise.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on investment performance and changes in personal circumstances.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical):
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable:** 20%

This strategy provides a balanced approach while optimizing tax advantages.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances and goals.
