To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and filing status, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Allocate Based on Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for investments meant for retirement. These accounts benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use your taxable accounts for funds that you may need in the near future. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Investment Type**: Consider holding more volatile investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter them from taxes. Use less aggressive assets, like bonds, in taxable accounts where interest income is taxed.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Assess the distribution annually to ensure it aligns with changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

By leveraging the tax advantages of each account type and aligning your investments with your long-term financial objectives, you can optimize your overall savings strategy.
