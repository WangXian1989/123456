To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Know the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. This helps in planning how much to allocate to each account type.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger, you might focus more on growth in your 401(k) and IRA, investing in stocks. If you're closer to retirement, consider a more balanced allocation.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts have different taxation rules on gains and dividends. Consider keeping investments that generate regular income (like bonds or dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts if possible.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and contributions to align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
