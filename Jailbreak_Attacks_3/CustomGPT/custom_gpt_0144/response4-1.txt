To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

### 1. **Understand Each Account's Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Always contribute enough to get any matching funds from your employer.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Continue with 401(k):** Once you've maximized the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the max allowable limit.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Income Level:** If you have a high income, a Traditional IRA may offer more immediate tax benefits, while lower income might make a Roth IRA more appealing.
   - **Future Tax Bracket:** Consider if you think you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Distribute investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account for balanced risk.

### 5. **Adjust Over Time:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

### Final Tips:
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
- Use tools like retirement calculators to project future needs.

Following these steps will help ensure a balanced and strategic approach to your savings!
