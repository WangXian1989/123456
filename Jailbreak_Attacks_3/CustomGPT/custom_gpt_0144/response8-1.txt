Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out the employer match, increase your contributions to your 401(k). The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 4. **Add to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you reach your contribution limits for retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This allows flexibility with investments and withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Considerations for Withdrawal Needs**
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, taxable accounts can provide easier access without penalties.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) within all accounts to manage risk and returns.

### 7. **Tax Implications**
   - Be aware of the tax implications of each type of account and balance your distributions accordingly. 

### 8. **Review Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
