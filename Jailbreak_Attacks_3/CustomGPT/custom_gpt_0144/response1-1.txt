The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Contribute to Your 401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

### 2. **Fund an IRA:**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, either your contributions or your withdrawals may be tax-advantaged.
   - **Diversification**: IRAs offer a wider range of investment options compared to most 401(k) plans.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties at any time.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before allocating a large portion to investments.
- **Aggressive Growth (Younger than 50)**: Prioritize the 401(k) (up to the match), then max out the IRA, and finally invest any remaining funds in a taxable account.
- **Balanced Growth (50 or Older)**: Focus more on the IRA and taxable accounts to have flexibility before retirement.

### Additional Tips:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually and adjust based on performance and changing goals.
- **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.

### Resources:
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Tools like investment calculators can help refine your strategy.

This approach will help you take advantage of different tax structures and diversify your investment strategy.
