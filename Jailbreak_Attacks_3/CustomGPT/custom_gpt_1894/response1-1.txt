Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a balanced approach to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros:** Employer match, tax-deferred growth, higher contribution limits.
   - **Cons:** Limited investment options, potential fees.
   - **Recommendation:** Max out contributions to get any employer match first—it’s essentially free money. If you can, contribute enough to meet the match and consider redirecting any additional funds to other accounts.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA Pros:** Tax-deferred growth, potential tax deduction.
   - **Traditional IRA Cons:** Taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA Pros:** Tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Roth IRA Cons:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Recommendation:** If you’re eligible, consider a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth. Balance this with a traditional IRA if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:** Flexibility, no contribution limits, access to funds anytime.
   - **Cons:** Taxable capital gains, dividends, and interest.
   - **Recommendation:** Use taxable accounts for savings goals with shorter time frames or to invest in strategies that may not be tied to retirement—like real estate or individual stocks.

### **General Tips:**
- **Assess Goals:** Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals.
- **Diversify Investments:** Hold a mix of assets in all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed.

### Example Distribution Strategy: 
1. **Max 401(k) with match**: 15%
2. **Roth IRA Contributions**: 10%
3. **Taxable Account**: 5%

This strategy is just a baseline; adjust based on your specific financial situation and needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
