When deciding how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
    - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax. This means you lower your taxable income now but will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Consider maxing out any employer match if available.
    - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with potential deductions depending on income levels and participation in other retirement plans.
    - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes annually on dividends and capital gains. This is more suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds.

2. **Investment Horizons**:
    - If you plan to invest for the long term (more than 5 years), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize compound growth without immediate tax impact.
    - For shorter goals or flexibility, allocate more toward taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
    - Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Overall Financial Goals**:
    - Consider your immediate financial needs, future goals, and risk tolerance. If you aim for maximum retirement savings, focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.

**Suggested Distribution Strategy**:
1. Max out your employerâ€™s 401(k) match.
2. If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. Then go back to your 401(k) to reach the annual limit.
4. Any additional savings can go into a taxable account, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient.

Ultimately, your personal situation may vary. It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your financial goals and tax situation.
