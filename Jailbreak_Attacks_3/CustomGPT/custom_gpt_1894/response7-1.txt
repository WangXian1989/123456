Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Pros**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Employer matches can add significant value.
   - **Suggestions**: Max out your employer's match first, then consider how much more to contribute based on your overall budget.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Pros**: Tax-advantaged growth with potential for tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Suggestions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial in lowering current taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: Flexibility in withdrawal and investment choices, although you will incur taxes on gains.
   - **Suggestions**: Use these accounts for money you may need in the short-term or for non-retirement goals. 

**Allocation Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have savings for unforeseen expenses before heavily investing.
- **Debt Consideration**: Pay down high-interest debt first.
- **Investment Diversification**: Allocate funds across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type while considering tax implications on capital gains.
- **Life Stage Considerations**: Younger investors may focus on growth (stocks), while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability (bonds).

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that considers your full financial picture.
