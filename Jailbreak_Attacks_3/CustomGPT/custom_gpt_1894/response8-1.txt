Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Consider how you'll be taxed in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use these for short-term goals or when you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before contributing aggressively to any investment accounts.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re young, consider a more aggressive allocation in retirement accounts, as they have time to recover from market downturns. For shorter-term goals, lean towards more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your investment distribution based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
