To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits for each account type. For instance, 401(k) plans typically have higher limits compared to IRAs.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on any profits realized.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your long-term goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match—it's essentially free money.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term needs.

6. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how much risk you’re willing to take and when you plan to access the funds.

7. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure your investments are diversified across the accounts and regularly rebalance to align with your risk profile.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Consider IRA Contributions Next**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. **Allocate Additional Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that offer more liquidity or for goals with shorter time horizons.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30% 
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

This is a generalized strategy; a more tailored plan would consider your specific financial situation, goals, and preferences. Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized insights.
