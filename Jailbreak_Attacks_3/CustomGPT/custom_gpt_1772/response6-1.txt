To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available). Then, fund your IRA (Roth or traditional depending on your income and tax situation) as it offers additional tax benefits.
- **Use taxable accounts for flexible investments**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **Diversify your investments**: Allocate different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Typically, more aggressive investments should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potentially higher returns.
- **Consider bond placement**: If holding bonds, it may be advantageous to place them in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher income tax rates on interest income.

### 3. Future Considerations
- **Assess withdrawal strategies**: Plan ahead for how and when you'll withdraw funds from each account type, considering tax implications. For example, funds in traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
- **Rebalance as necessary**: Regularly review your investments to ensure alignment with your long-term financial objectives, especially as you approach retirement.

By following these strategies, you can enhance your overall investment performance while managing tax liabilities effectively.
