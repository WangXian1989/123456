When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key factors: tax implications, growth potential, and liquidity needs. Here's a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider the tax benefits of pre-tax contributions or Roth options if available.
   - **IRA:** Aim to maximize contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages, considering your income level for Roth eligibility.

2. **Balancing Contributions Based on Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Prioritize your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and tax benefits.
   - **Immediate Needs:** Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Remember to review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
