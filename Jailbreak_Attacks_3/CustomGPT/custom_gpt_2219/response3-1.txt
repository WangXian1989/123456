Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current tax situation and future expectations. A traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This account typically has higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, use a taxable investment account for additional growth. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals, but keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Evaluate Asset Allocation**: Make sure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversifying your investments across different asset classes in all accounts can help manage risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so periodically review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s also advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Remember that individual situations vary, so it’s important to consider your personal goals and financial plan when making decisions about account distributions.
