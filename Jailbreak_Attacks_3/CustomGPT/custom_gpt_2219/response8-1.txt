Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to receive the full match before allocating money elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you have the option for a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**: If you have a long time horizon until retirement, you might opt for more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts. For funds you'll need sooner, a taxable account may provide easier access.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. Different accounts can hold different types of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.), which can help manage risk.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, you might prioritize paying that down before fully funding retirement accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from each type of account in retirement to minimize taxes—this often involves a strategy of withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts, depending on your tax situation at that time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each individual's financial situation is unique, and a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your goals and circumstances.

Ultimately, an ideal distribution will vary based on personal factors, so it's worth considering a balance that fits your lifestyle and long-term goals.
