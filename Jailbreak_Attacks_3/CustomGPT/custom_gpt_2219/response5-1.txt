Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) to benefit from any matching contributions. Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax preferences. Finally, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts, which provide flexibility but may be less tax-efficient compared to retirement accounts. Itâ€™s beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
