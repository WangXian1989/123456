When determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you don't pay taxes on contributions or earnings until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of it.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require after-tax contributions. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings from taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. This account is flexible but may not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. In 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 and older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 and older).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when deciding how to allocate investments across these accounts. Generally, more aggressive investments are suited for accounts where funds can grow tax-deferred for a longer period.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across multiple asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) for risk management, regardless of the account type.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals. Taxes will apply when you withdraw from 401(k) or traditional IRAs, while Roth IRAs may allow for tax-free withdrawals if held for at least five years.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.

By considering these aspects, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences.
