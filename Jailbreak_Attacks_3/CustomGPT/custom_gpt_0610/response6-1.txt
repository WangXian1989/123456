To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts provide tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth and potential tax deductions.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and up to $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - If you have access to a workplace retirement plan, consider contributing enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

**Additional Tips:**
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk.
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

Implementing these strategies will help you maximize your retirement savings and achieve long-term financial security.
