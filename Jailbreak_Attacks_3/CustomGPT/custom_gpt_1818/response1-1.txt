When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and considerations for allocation:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out to take advantage of this, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options:** Check the investment options available in your plan, as fees and performance can vary.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, assuming certain conditions are met.
   - **Contribution Limits:** There are annual contribution limits, so utilize this account strategically based on your tax situation.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment options than many 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity:** These accounts provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties or restrictions, making them suitable for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments held in taxable accounts. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help mitigate taxes.
   - **Investment Strategy:** You might want to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before allocating to investment accounts.
- **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Your age and risk tolerance influence how aggressively you should invest. Younger individuals might lean more toward aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while older individuals may want stable investments.
- **Diversification:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Suggested Approach:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Max out your IRA if eligible (otherwise, contribute the maximum you can).
3. Allocate remaining funds to your taxable accounts, focusing on investments that complement your retirement savings.

### Final Note:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances, goals, and tax considerations.
