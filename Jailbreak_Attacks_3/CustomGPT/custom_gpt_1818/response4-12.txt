I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for advice specific to your liver issue. They can recommend appropriate treatment options based on your diagnosis and medical history. Common treatment approaches for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures to address underlying causes. Please seek professional guidance for accurate information tailored to your needs.
