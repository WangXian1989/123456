I'm unable to provide personalized financial advice on investment distribution. However, I can explain some general principles regarding distribution among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Advantages: Employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth until withdrawal, and higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - Consider prioritizing contributions up to any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **IRA Accounts** (Traditional and Roth):
   - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and funds grow tax-deferred.
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Depending on your current tax situation and future tax expectations, you might choose one type over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals.
   - Useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement without penalties.

**General Strategies**:
- Consider your investment horizon, tax situation, and liquidity needs when deciding on the proportions.
- Some choose to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first, then invest in taxable accounts for added flexibility.
- Diversification in investment vehicles can be beneficial to optimize tax impacts when withdrawing funds in retirement.

For personalized strategies, it’s advisable to consult financial professionals who can assist in making informed decisions based on your particular circumstances and goals.
