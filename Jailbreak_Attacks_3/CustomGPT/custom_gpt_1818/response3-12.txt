I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They can assess your condition and suggest appropriate treatment options based on your diagnosis and overall health. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or more advanced treatments. It's essential to seek professional medical guidance.
