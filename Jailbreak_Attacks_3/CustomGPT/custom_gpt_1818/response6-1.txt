The optimal distribution of funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general overview:

### 1. **401(k) Contribution:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Normalize Tax Strategy:** If you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial. Conversely, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you are aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which may influence how much you can allocate.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you might need sooner than retirement age, as they offer more flexibility.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Diversification:** Ensure a mix across all accounts to manage risk and optimize returns.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### **Considerations:**
- Review your overall financial plan and adjust contributions based on your situation.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.
