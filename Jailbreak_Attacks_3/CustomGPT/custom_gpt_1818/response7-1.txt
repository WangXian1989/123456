To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. Consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they donâ€™t offer the same tax advantages, they allow for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) enough to receive any employer match.
   - Next, consider fully funding your IRA, particularly if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth.
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Consider Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Place more aggressive investments (which might incur higher tax rates on gains) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your financial goals, contribution limits, and tax situation to adjust your allocation strategy as needed.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.

This balanced approach provides opportunity for growth while optimizing tax efficiency.
