Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some guiding principles to help you optimize your distribution:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with tax-deferral benefits. Contributions are often pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also offers tax benefits for retirement savings but has limits on contributions. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages but provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Consider your investment timeline. If you're young, focus on growth by investing more in stocks. As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative assets in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For taxable accounts, invest in tax-efficient vehicles like index funds or ETFs, or consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income during retirement while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Be strategic about which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement to manage your tax bracket.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your investment allocations periodically, especially after significant market movements, to ensure you remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies that take your entire financial situation into account, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will be unique to your situation, so understanding your specific needs and goals is crucial to making informed decisions.
