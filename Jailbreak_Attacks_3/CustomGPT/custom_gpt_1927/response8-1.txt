Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility, but investment gains are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher expected returns, such as stocks or mutual funds that may generate significant taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like bonds or index funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing.

5. **Investment Goals & Timeline**: Align your asset distribution with your financial goals and timeline. For short-term goals, keep funds in accessible, stable investments. For long-term goals, consider a more aggressive investment strategy.

6. **Adjust as Needed**: Review and adjust your contributions and allocations annually or when there are significant life changes (e.g., changing jobs, getting married).

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances. They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and long-term objectives.
