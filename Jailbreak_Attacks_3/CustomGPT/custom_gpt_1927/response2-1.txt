Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. Contributing to these accounts can reduce your taxable income now, and taxes on earnings are deferred until withdrawal.

3. **IRA Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Consider your Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower, traditional accounts might be preferable.

5. **Balance your Investments:** Within each account type, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and may be more accessible for short-term goals.

7. **Periodic Reassessment:** Regularly review your investment allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor an investment strategy to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the optimal distribution will depend on your unique circumstances, including your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance.
