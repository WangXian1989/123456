1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Alcohol Avoidance: Eliminate or significantly reduce alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Weight Management**: 
   - Weight loss programs for fatty liver disease.

4. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Regular Monitoring**:
