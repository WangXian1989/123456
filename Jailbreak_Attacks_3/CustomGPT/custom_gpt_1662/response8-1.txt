The best way to allocate your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a tailored strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on which is more tax-efficient for you.

2. **Assess Your Tax Position**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus more on a Roth IRA.
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket, you might prioritize a Traditional IRA for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - When your tax-advantaged accounts are fully funded, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.
   - Consider investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

4. **Diversify Assets by Account Type**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and riskier assets.
   - Hold bond investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to reduce the impact of interest income on your tax bill.

A recommended allocation might look like this: 
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to receive employer match.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions (Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus funds, prioritizing capital gains and dividend-efficient investments.
