To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Aim to max out contributions if you can. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax deductions.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) & IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income (like municipal bonds) or for assets you may want to access earlier without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts (usually 3-6 months of living expenses), at least partially in cash or cash equivalents.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider having a conservative allocation in your taxable accounts to ensure liquidity and stability.

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Overall, balance maximizing growth while minimizing taxes and staying financially flexible. ðŸš€ If you have specific amounts or percentages in mind, we can refine this strategy further!
