To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA for tax advantages. 

2. **Allocate by Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on high-growth investments that can benefit from tax deferral.

This strategy can balance growth and tax efficiency, ultimately bolstering your retirement savings while managing your tax liabilities effectively. Would you like more tailored insights based on specific account balances or investment preferences?
