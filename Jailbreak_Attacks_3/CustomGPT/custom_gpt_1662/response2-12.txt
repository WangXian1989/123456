I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and reduce saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - For certain liver diseases, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or treat underlying conditions (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and assess the progression of any underlying disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions such as liver transplant may be necessary if the liver is severely damaged.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people find liver-supporting supplements beneficial, but always discuss these with a healthcare provider first.

It's crucial to have an accurate diagnosis before pursuing treatment. Please reach out to a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your situation.
