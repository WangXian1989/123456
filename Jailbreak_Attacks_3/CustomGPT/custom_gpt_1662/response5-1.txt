(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for tax-advantaged growth.
