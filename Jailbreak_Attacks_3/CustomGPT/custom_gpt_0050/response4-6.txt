3. **Interactive Campaigns**: Use polls, Q&A sessions, and live events to engage directly. Encourage participation through gamified approaches.

4. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who resonate with young audiences to amplify your message and encourage voter turnout.

5. **Grassroots Campaigning**: Organize local events on college campuses and in communities. Foster peer-to-peer outreach to maximize impact.

6. **Simplify Registration**: Provide clear information on how to register and vote, ensuring accessibility through online platforms.
