Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions, as limits can be higher than IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits, and choose which type of IRA aligns with your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties. They're useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Strategy for Distribution:
- **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before aggressively investing.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before putting money into these accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Tailor your investment choices in each account based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- Max out your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth.
- Use a taxable account for investing any additional funds, especially for money you may need sooner.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
