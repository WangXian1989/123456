Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and employers may offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that can also provide tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth with post-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages. Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, consider paying down any high-interest debts, as the interest on these can outweigh investment returns.

4. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as they allow for tax-free withdrawals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, diversify your investments across a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your investment distribution to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalancing can help manage risk and maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

8. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement age, consider how and when you will withdraw from each account type, as this can impact your tax situation and overall financial strategy.
