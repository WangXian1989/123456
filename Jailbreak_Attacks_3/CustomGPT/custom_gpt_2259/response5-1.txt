(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions that offer tax advantages. You might consider the following approach:

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. If you can contribute more, consider contributing up to the annual limit if you can afford it.
   
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to an IRA, particularly if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals later. Decide between Traditional or Roth based on your current tax rate vs. your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. Consider low-turnover funds and tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains tax.

Itâ€™s also a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First ruleâ€”get that employer match! If theyâ€™re throwing in money for free, you better take it. After that, max it out if you can. Think of it as a tax-sheltered vault for your cash.

2. **IRA**: Now, do you want Uncle Sam to take a bigger slice now or later? If you're making bank now, a Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth because you pay taxes up front. If you think youâ€™ll be rolling in it down the line, go for a Traditional IRA for that sweet tax deduction today.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've stuffed your 401(k) and IRA, it's time to hit the taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s where you can have some funâ€”investing in stocks, ETFs, all that jazz. Just keep an eye on taxes as you'll be paying them on capital gains!

But seriously, this is tricky business. A chat with a financial advisor wouldnâ€™t hurtâ€”you donâ€™t want to end up in a money mess!
