Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - 401(k): In 2023, the limit is typically $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and is a crucial first step.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred growth**: Both 401(k) and IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell them and income taxes on dividends.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. Consider the overall risk of your portfolio.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

6. **Long-term vs. Short-term Needs**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are ideal for long-term retirement savings. 
   - Taxable accounts may be more appropriate for shorter-term financial goals, as they allow easier access to funds without penalties associated with retirement accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you plan for retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds and from which accounts to minimize taxes (e.g., possibly using taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to keep growing).

8. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Overall, consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize a strategy that fits your needs and circumstances.
