Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Here are general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Invest Aggressively**: If you're younger and have a long time horizon, you can afford to take more risks with higher potential returns.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions for the tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the short term, as you can withdraw without penalties.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund before investing aggressively.
- **Balanced Approach**: Aim for a mix based on your risk toleranceâ€”more in retirement accounts when young, gradually shifting to taxable accounts as you approach retirement.
- **Regular Reassessment**: Review your allocations annually to adjust for changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
It can also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
