Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax; withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. Good for higher income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers tax-deferred growth. Consider if your tax rate is likely lower in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but interest and dividends are taxed.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Typically, higher-risk investments might be more suited to long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep an appropriate amount in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as these can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, you can strategically sell losing investments to offset gains, which can be a tax-efficient strategy.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to maintain desired asset allocation and risk level.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances.

This strategy can help you optimize your investments and manage your tax situation effectively.
