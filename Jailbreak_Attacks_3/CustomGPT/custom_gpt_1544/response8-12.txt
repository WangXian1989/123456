1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Healthy Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Engage in physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:

   - **Liver Supplements**: Some may suggest supplements like milk thistle.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: To assess liver damage.
   - **Ultrasound**: To monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
