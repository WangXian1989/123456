I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other treatments based on the specific condition. Common advice could include avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and managing any underlying health issues. Please reach out to a medical expert for guidance tailored to your situation.
