Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with higher limits if you're age 50+).
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible now, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (taxed now, withdrawals are tax-free). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Invest After Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and investment timeframe.
   - **Bond Allocation**: Typically, itâ€™s beneficial to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - **Annual Check-Up**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance and changes in goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals, consider speaking with a certified financial planner.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while considering your investment goals will lead to optimal growth over time.
