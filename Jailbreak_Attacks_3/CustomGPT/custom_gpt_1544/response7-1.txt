When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This offers tax-deferred growth. Contribute to it to the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - Use your **taxable accounts** for short-term goals or liquidity needs, as you'll have easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Keep high-return investments in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks in a Roth IRA).
   - Place lower-return or tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and respond to market changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider talking to a financial professional.

By strategically allocating funds and considering taxes, you can optimize your retirement savings effectively.
