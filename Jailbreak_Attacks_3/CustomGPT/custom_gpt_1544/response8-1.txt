Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRAs**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for:
   - Investing in assets that produce capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than regular income.
   - Short-term savings or investment goals where you may need access to funds sooner.

4. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401(k))**: Hold bonds or other interest-producing assets that generate ordinary income, which would be taxed higher in taxable accounts.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Favor stocks or index funds for long-term growth to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're maintaining a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Review Annually**: Reassess your allocations yearly based on any changes in your income, tax situation, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
