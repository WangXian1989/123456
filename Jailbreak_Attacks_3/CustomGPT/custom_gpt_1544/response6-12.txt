I'm not a doctor, but liver problems can have various causes, and the best treatment often depends on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: If the liver issue is caused by hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases, these can help manage the condition.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - Abstaining from alcohol and being cautious with medications and environmental toxins.

5. **Consultation with a Specialist**:
   - Working with a hepatologist (liver specialist) can provide tailored treatment options based on your specific diagnosis.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your individual situation.
