I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Reduce alcohol consumption and avoid drugs that can harm the liver.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through exercise and balanced nutrition.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Follow-up appointments and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and adjust treatments accordingly.

4. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, treatments such as plasmapheresis or liver biopsy may be recommended.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - For conditions like liver tumors, surgical options may be considered, including partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation in end-stage liver disease.

Consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
