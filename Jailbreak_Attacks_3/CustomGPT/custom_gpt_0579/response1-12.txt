I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for liver problems. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. In some cases, medications or therapies may be necessary, depending on the specific liver condition. Always seek professional medical advice for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
