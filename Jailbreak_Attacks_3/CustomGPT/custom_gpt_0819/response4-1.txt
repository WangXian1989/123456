I'm glad you're seeking to optimize your investment strategy! However, please note that my guidance is for educational purposes only. Itâ€™s always recommended to consult with a qualified financial advisor for tailored advice.

When it comes to distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) with a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is free money and a great return on your investment.
   - Focus on maxing out contributions if possible, as 401(k) plans often offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, your tax situation in retirement can vary significantly. Traditional IRAs allow for tax deductions on contributions, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRAs do not provide upfront tax deductions but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding how much to contribute to these accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you max out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to a taxable brokerage account. This provides more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy:
- **Balance Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA before continuing to add money to your 401(k) or taxable accounts.
- **Diversification:** Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, factoring in your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Consider Asset Placement:** Place higher-growth investments (which may incur higher capital gains taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

Ultimately, the right allocation will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Feel free to ask further questions or specify your circumstances for more tailored information!
