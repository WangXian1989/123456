When distributing your money among different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - After that, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and expected retirement income.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Invest in taxable accounts once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, providing easier access to funds when needed without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:**
     - Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax consequences.
     - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize tax impacts during the distribution phase.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax brackets and retirement income needs, taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. **Consider Retirement Timeline:**
   - Adjust your contributions based on how far you are from retirement; prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if retirement is more than a decade away.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation remains consistent across all accounts, adjusting for market performance and changes in financial goals.

### Conclusion:
By optimizing your distribution strategy based on tax implications and investment goals, you can enhance your overall financial health and retirement readiness. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances.
