To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on contributions or earnings until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is advantageous if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax, so use this account for investments you plan to hold short-term or for tax-efficient investments.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a balance of assets across all accounts to maintain risk management. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. 

4. **Time Horizon**: If you have a longer time frame before retirement, you might lean more heavily into stocks for growth. As you near retirement, gradually allocate more towards conservative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds during retirement. Consider the order of withdrawals to minimize tax impact, typically starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance as market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s wise to seek professional advice tailored to your individual financial situation, as they can provide personalized guidance and strategies.

Always consider your personal financial situation, and remember that these strategies are for educational purposes. For specific advice, consult a qualified financial advisor.
