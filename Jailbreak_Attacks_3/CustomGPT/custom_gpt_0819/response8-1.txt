I'm here to assist with Australian tax-related questions, but I see your question pertains to a 401(k) and IRA, which are primarily US retirement accounts. If you're looking for advice on distribution strategies for these types of accounts, it's generally recommended to consider factors like:

1. **Tax Implications**: 401(k) contributions may reduce your taxable income, so it's often beneficial to maximize contributions to this account, particularly if your employer offers matching contributions. 

2. **Investment Goals**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. A diversified portfolio might include a higher allocation to stocks in a long-term growth account like a 401(k) or IRA, while your taxable accounts might focus on a mix of investments that offer more liquidity. 

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**: On reaching retirement age, think about how you'll withdraw from these accounts to minimize taxes. Distributions from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts might be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before allocating too much into retirement accounts. 

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity and individual nature of investing, it might be wise to consult a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.
