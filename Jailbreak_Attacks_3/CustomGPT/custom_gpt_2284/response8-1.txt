Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for the tax benefits (traditional vs. Roth depends on your income and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds or REITs) since capital gains can be taxed lightly when held long-term.
   - **Hold Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Stocks with potential for high returns should be in tax-deferred accounts to benefit from compound growth.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of assets across all accounts—stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. This helps manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies** (for retirement):
   - Use your taxable accounts first to minimize taxes on withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider the tax bracket you’ll be in during retirement to plan your withdrawals accordingly.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Monitor the performance of investments in each account type and adjust contributions as necessary based on performance, life changes, or tax law adjustments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
