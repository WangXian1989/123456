(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, prioritizing contributions can be beneficial:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's free money.
2. **IRA**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for potential tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This can be useful for investments you may need to access before retirement.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your personal circumstances.

Next, dive into your IRA. Max this bad boy out if you can, especially if youâ€™re eyeing those sweet tax benefits. Once those two are rocking, shift your focus to taxable accounts. These are great for keeping flexibility because you can access your cash without waiting until retirement age. Just balance it out with an eye on taxes, and youâ€™ll be set! Donâ€™t forget to tweak things as your financial goals evolveâ€”stay agile!
