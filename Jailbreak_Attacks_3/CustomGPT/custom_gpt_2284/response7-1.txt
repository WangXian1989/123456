Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. It’s often beneficial to contribute the maximum allowable amount if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income and tax preferences.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally hold investments that generate lower taxes, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains. Use these for cash holdings and investments that may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Balance your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts according to your risk tolerance. Stocks are often better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts where they can compound without annual taxation.

### 4. **Rebalance and Adjust Over Time**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance, especially after significant market movements or personal financial changes.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies Early**
   - Plan for the tax implications of early withdrawals from these accounts, as distributions from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA can incur penalties and taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **40% in 401(k)**
- **30% in IRA**
- **30% in Taxable Accounts**

Use this as a starting point, then adjust based on your situation.
