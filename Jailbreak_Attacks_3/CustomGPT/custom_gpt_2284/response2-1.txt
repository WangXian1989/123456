Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility in withdrawals and investments, though they are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments are diversified within these accounts to manage risk effectively. 

5. **Emergency Savings**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, or investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
