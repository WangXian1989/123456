(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and the investment options available in each account. A general strategy is to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer the highest tax advantages. For instance, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, you should contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth. Finally, any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts where you can manage your investment strategy more flexibly.

Smash those contributions firstâ€”free money is hard to come by! After youâ€™ve snagged that, think about your IRA. The Roth IRA is basically a tax-free party when you hit retirement age, so put in cash there if you can. Finally, donâ€™t ignore taxable accounts; they can be super flexible for your short-term goals or snatching up hot investments. You want a balanced approach, but focus on maximizing tax benefits where you can. Just remember, everyone's situation is different, so tweak this plan to fit your financial vibe!
