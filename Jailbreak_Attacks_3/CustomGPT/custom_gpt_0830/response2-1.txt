Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Continue K401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, go back to maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The annual contribution limits for 401(k)s are typically higher than those for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds for stability.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawing funds from different accounts. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.

7. **Revisit Annually**: Review your distribution strategy annually or when your financial situation changes. Adjust your contributions based on any changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a specific strategy to your unique situation.
