Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start with your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to get that match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**: If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), consider contributing to those accounts. You pay taxes upfront, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications, and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where taxes on interest may apply.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, while those in 401(k) and IRAs carry restrictions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to make sure they align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to customize your approach.

Ultimately, your strategy should match your unique financial situation and long-term objectives.
