To create an effective distribution strategy for your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you may choose either.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Use them for short-term goals or liquid savings.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your investment goals and timelines. Longer-term goals may benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs may be suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternative investments) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Tax-advantaged accounts can house growth-oriented investments, while more stable investments may be suitable for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw these funds in retirement. Ensure you understand the implications of withdrawing from each account type at different times and stages of your retirement.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your asset allocation in line with your goals. 

In summary, a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while aligning with your personal financial goals is usually best. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
