To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching. Focus on contributing enough to get the full match if available, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-deferred but has contribution limits. There are two types: Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, which have different tax implications upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon selling. They offer more flexibility with withdrawals and can be useful for goals outside of retirement.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with maximizing employer match in your 401(k).
   - Then contribute to your IRA, especially if you can benefit from tax deduction (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - Finally, contribute to your taxable accounts as needed for liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with when you plan to access the funds. For long-term retirement savings, consider more aggressive investments. For shorter-term goals, a more conservative approach may be appropriate.

4. **Balance Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments that might be taxed at favorable capital gains rates.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Revisit your investment allocation periodically and adjust based on performance, your financial situation, and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also be beneficial to create a personalized investment strategy based on your specific circumstances.
