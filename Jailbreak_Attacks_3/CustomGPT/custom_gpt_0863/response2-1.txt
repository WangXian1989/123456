Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for investments. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Define what you are saving for (retirement, purchasing a home, education, etc.) and your timeline for each goal.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth could offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: 
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to the 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to a taxable account. This is where you will pay taxes on any gains, but it also offers greater flexibility and no contribution limits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to manage risk.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your accounts and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement plans.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, consider your goals and timelines, diversify your investments, and stay flexible with your contributions.
