Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax advantages. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals in retirement (if qualified) are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Retirement Horizon**:
   - If you're younger, you might allocate more to stocks in your 401(k) or IRA for growth, while using your taxable account for short-term savings or emergency funds.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting toward more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and keep less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Review**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocation regularly (at least annually) to reflect changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

It's also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
