To effectively allocate your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine if your priority is long-term growth for retirement, short-term savings, or a mix of both.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferral. Aim to max out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to sooner. These can provide flexibility and may have different investment options.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in higher-growth assets (like stocks) since the tax impact is deferred. In taxable accounts, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding how much to allocate to taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts.
