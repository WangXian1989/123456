Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Once youâ€™re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions can grow tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **401(k) Contributions**
   - After your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k). Consider increasing your contributions as your income grows or as you reach certain financial goals.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After hitting limits in tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for short-term needs and investments.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk assets (like stocks) can be more beneficial in long-term tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. 401(k) and traditional IRA distributions are taxed as regular income, whereas qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.

### 7. **Tax Loss Harvesting**
   - In taxable accounts, utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains. This can help reduce your tax liability.

### 8. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in income, tax law, and personal circumstances.

### Summary
- Prioritize employer matching in your 401(k).
- Contribute to your IRA for additional tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term goals.
- Consider a balanced asset allocation strategy aligned with your risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor a strategy to fit your specific situation.
