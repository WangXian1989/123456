Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match First**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit. The tax-deferred nature of these accounts means you won’t pay taxes on the money you contribute until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you can, also contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you want tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional funds into a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Adjust your investment strategy based on the account type:
   - For retirement accounts, focus on long-term growth and tax efficiency.
   - In taxable accounts, consider investments that generate minimal taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, ideally covering at least 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, and tax laws.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation.
