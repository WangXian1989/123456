Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Advantages**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer matching contributions. 
   - **Considerations**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money. After reaching the match, consider your overall asset allocation and fees associated with your 401(k) fund choices.

### 2. **Traditional IRA**
   - **Advantages**: Tax-deductible contributions (depending on income), tax-deferred growth.
   - **Considerations**: Great for additional retirement savings. Contributing up to the annual limit can be beneficial, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

### 3. **Roth IRA**
   - **Advantages**: Tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Considerations**: Start contributing early if you qualify; this can lead to significant tax-free growth.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties, variety of investment options.
   - **Considerations**: Use these for goals outside retirement (e.g., home purchase, education). Be mindful of capital gains taxes on your investments.

### **General Guidelines**
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Ensure you maximize employer matches in your 401(k), then contribute sufficiently to a Roth or Traditional IRA before investing in a taxable account.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Consider Taxes**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in your tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or when significant life changes occur.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: To the full employer match, then 10-15% of salary.
2. **IRA**: Max out contribution limits (depending on whether it’s Traditional or Roth).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any savings beyond retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor this strategy to fit your unique situation, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
