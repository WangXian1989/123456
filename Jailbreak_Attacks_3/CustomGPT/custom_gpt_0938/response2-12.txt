   - **Medications**: Diuretics for swelling, beta-blockers to reduce portal hypertension.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

   - **Chemotherapy and Radiation**: Often used for advanced cases or when surgery isn’t viable.
   - **Targeted Therapy**: Newer treatments that specifically target cancer cells may be effective.

5. **General Support**:
