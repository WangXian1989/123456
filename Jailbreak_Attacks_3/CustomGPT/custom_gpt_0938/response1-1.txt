Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are key strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible (up to the annual limit).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions up front.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from a Roth account are tax-free. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to mitigate risk—mix stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Consider Investment Strategies**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. More aggressive investments that may produce higher short-term gains could be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Needs**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. You’ll want to ensure you have cash on hand for unexpected expenses.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Reevaluate your strategies annually or whenever there are significant life changes (like a job change, marriage, etc.) to ensure your investment distribution aligns with your goals.

By prioritizing contributions to retirement accounts and understanding the tax implications, you can create a more effective distribution strategy. If you’re unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
