When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a basic strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), which helps reduce your taxable income. Choose traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), IRAs can be traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free retirement withdrawals). Again, consider your tax bracket now versus expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Use this account for investments with high potential for capital appreciation or for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially if your financial situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This method will help you effectively build a retirement strategy that balances growth with tax efficiency.
