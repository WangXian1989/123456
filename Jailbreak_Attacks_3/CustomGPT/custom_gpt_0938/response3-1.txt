Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here's a structured approach to help you determine the best allocation:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers pre-tax contributions, lowering your taxable income. Employers may match contributions, providing an immediate return.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility in terms of access to funds and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if your main goal is retirement.
   - **Short-term Needs:** If you anticipate needing funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match before putting money into IRAs.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities (e.g., index funds or ETFs).
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions before exceeding your 401(k) contributions.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure that your investments across these accounts are well-diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Adjust as Needed**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

### Example Allocation Plan
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions (if possible, e.g., 15% of salary)**
2. **Contribute up to the IRA limit (either Roth or Traditional)**
3. **Any remaining savings can go into a taxable account for flexibility**

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy based on your individual circumstances, especially considering changes in tax laws or personal financial situations. Keep in mind your long-term financial health and how each account fits into your overall strategy.
