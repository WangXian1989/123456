(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax situation. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, like your 401(k) and IRA, before investing in taxable accounts. 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, go back to increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the allowed limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for additional savings and investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

Itâ€™s important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the best strategy for your specific needs.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer matches contributions? GO FOR IT! Thatâ€™s free money, and we love free stuff.
2. **IRA is Next**: Put some cash in your IRAâ€”traditional or Roth, depending on whether you want tax breaks now or later.
3. **Tackle That 401(k)**: Keep pumping up your 401(k) contributions after maxing out your IRA. Letâ€™s get that tax shelter stackinâ€™!
4. **Go Wild with Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out the tax-advantaged stuff, hit up those taxable accounts as the cherry on top.
