(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, you should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings to take advantage of tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a simple strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, which offers tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth) growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts which provide more flexibility, though they may incur capital gains taxes.
