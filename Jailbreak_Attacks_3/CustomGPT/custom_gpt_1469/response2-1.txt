The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions for the year ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify based on income, as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA might provide tax deductions now.

2. **Decide on Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, aggressive investments (stocks) can be placed in accounts where withdrawals will happen later (like your 401(k) or IRA) for higher growth potential.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be used for mid-term goals or emergencies since they're not subject to penalties for early withdrawal. However, they don't have tax advantages, so consider less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or certain actively managed funds) to minimize capital gains implications.

4. **Strategic Withdrawals**: 
   - When you reach retirement, plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, then consider when to take distributions from your tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments regularly to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal situation.
