To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners who want to lower their tax bill now.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Determine your long-term and short-term goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts primarily for long-term growth (retirement) while using taxable accounts for more immediate goals.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for withdrawals without penalty or restrictions, making them ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Generally, impose penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59Â½) unless specific conditions are met.

4. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

5. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA. This is essentially free money.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes and account types to balance risk and return.

7. **Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider how long you plan to invest in each account. Longer time horizons can take more risks, while shorter horizons should focus on stability.

### A Suggested Approach:
1. Max out your employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. After max funding those, consider additional contributions to your 401(k) and then the taxable account for more flexibility.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
Lastly, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your income, tax situation, investment preferences, and financial goals.
