Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax bracket, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match — this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth; funds withdrawn in retirement are not taxed.
   - A Traditional IRA may provide tax benefits now, but taxes will be due on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - This can provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment types.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: Max out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k), then IRA).
- **Diversify Investments**: Distribute your investments across asset types (stocks, bonds) to manage risk.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changing financial situations and goals.

### Considerations:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
- Review your investments regularly to ensure they align with your long-term goals.
