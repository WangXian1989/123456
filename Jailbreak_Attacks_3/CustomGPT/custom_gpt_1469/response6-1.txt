When considering the best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to weigh the tax implications, investment goals, and personal circumstances. Here’s a concise roadmap:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match – this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation and future income expectations.

2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that might have quick access needs or for strategies that involve tax loss harvesting (selling investments at a loss to offset taxes on gains).

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is well-balanced across various asset classes, considering risk tolerance.

4. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - Periodically assess your investment performance and contribution levels, adjusting your strategy based on life changes or market conditions.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize growth after taxes.

By prioritizing contributions effectively and staying mindful of tax impacts, you can optimize your investment strategy for better long-term growth.
