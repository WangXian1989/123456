Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, risk, and your long-term financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains. Keep investments that generate regular income, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts but adjust based on tax implications. For example, place higher-return, higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Your financial situation and goals may change. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and tax laws.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how withdrawals will affect taxes in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial, leaving tax-deferred accounts for later.

### Sample Allocation (for illustration):
- **401(k)**: 30%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 40%
