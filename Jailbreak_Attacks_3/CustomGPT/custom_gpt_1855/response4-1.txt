Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized retirement account contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for goals that are shorter-term (like buying a home or funding a vacation).

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk better. Each account can have different investment strategies based on tax implications and accessibility.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally, from tax-free accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.
