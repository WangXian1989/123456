I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems, which often depend on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors might prescribe antiviral drugs or medications to reduce inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can greatly improve liver health.

3. **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoiding alcohol is crucial, especially in conditions like alcoholic liver disease.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation might be an option if the liver is significantly damaged.

Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential for a tailored treatment plan. Always follow their advice!
