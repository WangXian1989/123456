Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options.

3. **Max Out 401(k):** If you can, try to max out your 401(k) contributions after funding your IRA. Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) lower your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. They offer more liquidity and tax flexibility, but keep in mind that you’ll pay capital gains taxes on investments you sell for a profit.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of where you place certain investments:
   - **Bonds** may be more tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) due to interest income being taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Stocks** may be better suited for taxable accounts since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your allocation periodically, especially as your income levels and financial goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
