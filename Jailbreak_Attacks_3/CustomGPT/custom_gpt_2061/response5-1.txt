(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment philosophy. Generally, a good strategy is:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is often a great way to benefit from pre-tax or Roth contributions.
2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility and to cover short-term goals. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: First off, shove as much cash as you can into this bad boy, especially if your employer is matchingâ€”that's free money! Seriously, donâ€™t leave that on the table.
   
2. **IRA**: Once youâ€™re rocking that 401(k), dive into an IRA. If you can score a Roth IRA, go for itâ€”tax-free growth is where itâ€™s at! If youâ€™re not eligible, a Traditional IRA still kicks butt with tax-deferral benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out those two, throw some cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility galore for short-term needs or if you're itching to invest in something wild. Stick to tax-efficient investments like index funds so Uncle Sam doesnâ€™t take too big of a bite when you cash out.
