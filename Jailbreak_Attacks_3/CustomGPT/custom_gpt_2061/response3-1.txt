When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic breakdown:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your long-term savings.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the maximum annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that may be taxed at a lower rate (like qualified dividends). This is also beneficial for funds you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Evaluate the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

**Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.**
