To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate returns on your investment.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be subject to frequent trading or hold assets that generate taxable income (like certain bonds). This can help you manage your tax liabilities better.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) or IRA), while holding more stable or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Review & Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial situation.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances.
