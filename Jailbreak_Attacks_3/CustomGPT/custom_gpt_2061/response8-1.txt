Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts optimally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefit:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth might be better.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to max out your IRA contributions, $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for goals within 5 years, as they offer flexibility.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on investments like index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate lower capital gains distributions.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Timeline:** Diversify your portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Consider placing growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - **Regularly Reassess:** Keep reviewing your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your individual situation.
