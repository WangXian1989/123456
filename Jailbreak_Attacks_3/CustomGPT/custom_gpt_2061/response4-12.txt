I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, and eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.

3. **Supplements**: Some people find benefit from liver-supporting supplements, but always consult with a healthcare provider first.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track progress and adjust treatment plans.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
