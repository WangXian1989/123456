Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers a limited selection of mutual funds or target-date funds. Focus on a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** This may offer broader investment options, including individual stocks, ETFs, and bonds. Use this flexibility to diversify further.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that might produce taxable income (like dividends) in a tax-efficient manner, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Aim to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Consider Roth conversions in years with lower income to manage future tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts regularly to maintain your desired level of risk.

### Final Thoughts
- Tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances, and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice. 
- Always keep an eye on fees and investment growth potential across all your accounts. 

By employing this comprehensive approach, you can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
