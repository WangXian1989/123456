Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**  
If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized, and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Investment Types:**
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) for investments that are expected to generate high taxable income, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
   - Use Roth IRAs for investments expected to have high growth potential, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can hold investments that produce lower tax burdens, such as index funds or investments you plan to hold long-term to benefit from capital gains rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - For retirement savings, focus on tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes. If you need liquidity before retirement, keep a portion in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment performance.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often works best, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining enough liquidity via taxable accounts. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.
