The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributing to a Roth IRA can also be beneficial if you're eligible.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:** 
   - **401(k):** Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs have similar tax implications, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are taxed differentlyâ€”capital gains tax applies when you sell investments for a profit.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Decide on your overall investment strategy. A balanced approach might include stocks, bonds, or other assets depending on your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:** Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider working with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Always keep in mind the fees and expenses associated with each account type when making your distribution decisions.
