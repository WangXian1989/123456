Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income today. Keep in mind that youâ€™ll owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment to 401(k) contributions; consider this if you want tax benefits now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing, as taxable accounts offer easier access to cash without penalties.

4. **Diversify Based on Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is far off, you can afford to take more risks with equities.
   - As retirement approaches, gradually shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains from stocks).

6. **Overall Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind your overall risk tolerance and aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
