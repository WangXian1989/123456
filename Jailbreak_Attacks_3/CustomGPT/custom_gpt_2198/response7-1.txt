To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts benefit from tax deferrals and can lower your current taxable income.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Use a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Maintain a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity. This part can fund short-term goals and emergency expenses.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Allocate investments within each account according to risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks may be better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or cash may be in taxable accounts for stability.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and performance. Rebalance annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your tax situation. Higher-income earners may want to utilize tax-deferred accounts more, while those in lower brackets may benefit from Roth accounts.

By balancing tax advantages with your liquidity needs and investment goals, you can optimize your overall financial strategy.
