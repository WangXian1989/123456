To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**  
   Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:**  
   After maximizing your 401(k), consider making contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**  
   Use taxable accounts for additional savings once youâ€™ve utilized tax-advantaged accounts. This is great for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:**  
   Ensure varied investments across accounts:
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth, using a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type (Roth or Traditional), choose investments that align with your tax strategy and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more liquid investments or funds that generate lower taxable income.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:**  
   Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. More tax-efficient investments can go in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly:**  
   Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to reflect changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

By following these principles, you can optimize your savings and investments in a way that aligns with your financial goals.
