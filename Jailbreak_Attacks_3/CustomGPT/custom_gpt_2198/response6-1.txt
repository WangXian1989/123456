To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Distributing funds into taxable accounts can offer flexibility for short-term needs, while keeping long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts can help reduce overall tax liability.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type for balanced growth.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits and Rules**:
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize growth potential.

5. **Regularly Reassess and Adjust**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

By strategically allocating your investments, you can optimize growth while managing your tax burden effectively.
