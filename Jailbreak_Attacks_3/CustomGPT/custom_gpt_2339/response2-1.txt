To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is basically "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contribute to tax-deferred accounts (like traditional IRAs or 401(k)s) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need before retirement or for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications, taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) in retirement.

5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Revisit and adjust your allocation periodically based on investment performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary widely, so professional guidance can help tailor a plan that suits your specific needs and goals.

By balancing contributions and strategically allocating investments across these accounts, you can optimize your long-term financial health.
