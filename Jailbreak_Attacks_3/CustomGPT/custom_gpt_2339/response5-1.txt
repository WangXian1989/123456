To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Fund your IRA after your 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits. If you choose a Roth IRA, consider future tax implications when withdrawing.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments (stocks) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - As you approach retirement, plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impacts. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free accounts last (Roth IRA).

4. **Consider Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals, prioritize retirement accounts. For shorter-term goals (less than five years), use taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and goals, adjusting contributions and investments as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
