To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max it out if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA for its tax deduction benefits. 

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest funds here after maximizing tax-advantaged contributions. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to reduce capital gains tax. 

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your risk toleranceâ€”higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts, lower-risk in taxable accounts to mitigate taxes on gains.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix across all accounts to spread risk.

By following these principles, you can maximize your potential growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Adjust contributions based on your financial situation and investment goals.
