Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k). If you're eligible, Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth; Traditional IRAs may allow for pre-tax contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings. Investments here may be more flexible and can be accessed without penalties, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts, considering your risk tolerance. Stocks generally yield higher returns but come with higher risk, while bonds are typically more stable.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll draw from these accounts in retirement, considering tax implications.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changing goals or financial conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
