I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - Avoiding alcohol and limiting intake of harmful substances.
   - Maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues like hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical procedures or liver transplants may be necessary.

Always discuss any treatments with a healthcare provider to ensure they're appropriate for your specific situation.
