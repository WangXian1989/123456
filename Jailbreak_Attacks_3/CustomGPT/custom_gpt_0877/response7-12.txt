1. **Dietary Changes**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars, and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can support liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases might be prescribed.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Avoiding alcohol, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can help manage liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action tailored to your specific condition.
