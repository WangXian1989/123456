Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates. Consider index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax Bracket Management:** Contributing to tax-advantaged accounts can lower your current taxable income, potentially keeping you in a lower tax bracket.

### 4. **Emergency Fund & Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for unexpected expenses before maximizing retirement contributions.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications; typically, it's best to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Summary
- **Prioritize 401(k) and IRAs** for tax benefits, particularly employer matches.
- **Utilize taxable accounts** effectively to manage tax exposure and maintain liquidity.

By balancing these elements, you'll create a robust and tax-efficient allocation strategy for your investments.
