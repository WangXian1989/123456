Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers tax-deferred growth; prioritize contributions here for higher limits.
   - **IRA**: Depending on its type (traditional or Roth), it may provide tax breaks now or in retirement. Consider funding this next, especially if you can qualify for the Roth IRA income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that may produce lower-taxed gains (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Investment Considerations**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use lower-growth or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable tax treatment.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk based on your time horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your distributions to stay aligned with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your situation is also a good idea.
