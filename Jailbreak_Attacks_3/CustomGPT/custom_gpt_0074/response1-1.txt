Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your age, investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
- **Tax-deferred Growth**: Ideal for long-term growth; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes apply on withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- Aim to max out contributions annually ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50+ in 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties.
- **Investment Strategy**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Young Investors (30s-40s)**: Focus on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.
- **Mid-Career (50s)**: Start focusing more on taxable accounts to create liquidity for future needs.
- **Pre-Retirement (60+)**: Adjust your asset allocation towards income-generating investments while considering tax implications for withdrawals.

### Regular Review
- Reassess allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Balancing these accounts effectively can optimize your tax situation and help you meet your retirement goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
