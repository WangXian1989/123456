Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Aim to max out your contributions (currently $6,500/year, or $7,500 if you're 50+). Choose Roth for tax-free growth or Traditional for tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Only after maxing out the above should you contribute to taxable accounts. These can help with liquidity and offer more investment flexibility.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for compounding without immediate tax implications.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on high-growth or high-income-generating investments that may incur taxes in a taxable account.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings once the max limits are reached.
- Consider your financial goals and the tax implications of each account type.
