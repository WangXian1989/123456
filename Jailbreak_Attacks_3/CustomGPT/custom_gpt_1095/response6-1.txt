When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that may provide better liquidity.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-term vs. long-term**: Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks, mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks).
   - **Consider your retirement horizon**: Adjust your allocation based on how far you are from retirement; closer to retirement, shift toward safer investments.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for tax implications**: When you start withdrawing, consider the tax impact of withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA versus taxable accounts to minimize taxes over time.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, aim for 10-15% of your income.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum annual limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, perhaps around 10-20% of your savings once other accounts are maxed.

Always revisit this strategy based on market conditions and personal financial changes!
