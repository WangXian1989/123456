Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs give tax advantages on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to both a Roth and a traditional IRA to diversify your tax exposure later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are good for short- to medium-term goals since they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally:
   - **401(k)**: May offer limited investment options but often includes good choices like target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Usually has more flexible investment options including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and any changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Timeline**: Tailor your approach based on when you plan to retire or need access to the funds. More aggressive investments may be suitable for long-term goals, while more conservative options might be better for short-term needs.

7. **Consult with a Professional**: If youâ€™re uncertain, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that suits your specific situation.

By combining these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to managing your investments.
