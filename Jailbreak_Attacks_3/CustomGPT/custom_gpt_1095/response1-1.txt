Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that—it's essentially free money. Aim to max this account if possible, as contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, although you'll pay capital gains tax on earnings.

4. **Investing Strategy**:
   - Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term investments (like stocks) may be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) might be better in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be strategic about when you withdraw from each account. Consider your tax bracket and the potential impact of withdrawals on taxable income.

Regularly reassess your strategy as your financial situation changes! Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
