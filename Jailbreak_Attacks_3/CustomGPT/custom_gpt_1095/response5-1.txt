(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Take full advantage of your employerâ€™s match if available; itâ€™s essentially free money. Contribute enough to maximize this benefit, focusing on pre-tax contributions to reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Aim to max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility and access to funds. Opt for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.

Adjust the contributions based on your age, retirement goals, and anticipated tax bracket at withdrawal. Regular rebalancing and reviewing your investments is also crucial.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer offers a match, you better grab that! Itâ€™s like a no-brainer. Put in enough to hit the match, and then go all-in on your contributions. Pre-tax means youâ€™re saving on taxes now, which is awesome!

2. **IRA - Get Creative**: Youâ€™ve got options! If your income allows, snag a Roth IRA so you can party tax-free in retirement. If not, go for a Traditional IRA. Itâ€™s all about tax strategies that work best for your future self.

The best part? You can tweak this setup based on life changes, goals, and all the curveballs life throws. Keep your investments fresh and review regularly to stay on top of your game!
