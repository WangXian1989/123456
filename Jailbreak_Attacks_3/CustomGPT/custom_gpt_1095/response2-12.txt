I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Typical treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving a healthy weight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol is essential for liver recovery and health.

4. **Hepatitis Vaccination**: If you're at risk, vaccines for hepatitis A and B can help prevent infection.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments and tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

6. **Potential Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy for variceal bleeding or surgery for tumors might be necessary.

Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
