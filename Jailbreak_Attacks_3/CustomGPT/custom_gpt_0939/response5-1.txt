Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide to help you strategize:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Earnings grow tax-deferred. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, but with different rules. Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime. However, you'll be taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income, consider maxing out your IRA for its tax advantages. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Additional Contributions to 401(k)**: After maxing out the match and IRA contributions, allocate more to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after-tax investments. They can also provide flexibility for future expenses.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Consider Future Tax Rates**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher during retirement, prefer Roth accounts. If you expect it to be lower, traditional accounts may be better.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold investments that generate capital gains in taxable accounts, as they could be taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary widely. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your situation.

In summary, prioritize contributions to accounts that offer the best immediate and long-term benefits, while considering your tax implications and retirement goals.
