Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money. The 2024 limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but you'll pay income tax on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are funded with after-tax dollars. They can provide flexibility and diversification but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) since you're likely to be in these accounts long-term. You can afford to take more risks here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, but be mindful of tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk and return. This is crucial for achieving long-term financial goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or similar, separate from your investment accounts. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 6. **Long-Term Planning**:
   - Evaluate your retirement goals, including desired lifestyle, expenses, and timing of retirement. Adjust your contributions and allocations based on these goals.

### Expert Tip:
Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, including your risk tolerance and future financial plans.

By distributing your investments thoughtfully across these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and overall financial health while considering tax efficiency.
