Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings. These accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).
   - If you qualify, consider making Roth contributions to benefit from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, allocate more towards taxable accounts, as they provide easier access without penalties.
   - For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts, emphasizing stock investments that can benefit from compounding.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all account types, considering factors like risk tolerance and asset allocation. 

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically assess your allocations based on changes in financial circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals, especially in retirement. Taxable accounts can be affected by capital gains taxes, whereas tax-deferred accounts have required minimum distributions (RMDs).

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
