Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexible withdrawals and investments that may not fit into retirement accounts, but consider tax implications.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):**
     - Invest in assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds), which are taxed at a higher rate.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):**
     - Focus on assets expected to grow significantly, as the gains are tax-free upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Invest in long-term holdings to benefit from lower capital gains rates and consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure that you're diversifying across these accounts to manage risk and meet your investment goals.
   - Different accounts might have different investment strategies depending on their purpose and tax implications.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions as your income, tax bracket, and goals change over time.
   - Adjust your funding priority based on current financial landscape changes, such as tax laws or your financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
