Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider an IRA**:
   - If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity. This can be beneficial if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Assets**:
   - Within each type of account, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This could include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a certified financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.

By following this approach, you can effectively allocate your money across different accounts to optimize growth while managing tax implications and liquidity.
