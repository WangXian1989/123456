(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial while you are in a higher income bracket.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible and allow access without penalties, but keep in mind the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and possibly alternative investments.
   - Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.

4. **Adjust for Life Stages**: 
   - Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth investments, while older investors may want more stability as they approach retirement.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, money distribution! The holy grail of personal finance! So, you want to know how to juggle your dough among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts? Here's a cheeky breakdown for you:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer throws in free money for matching contributions, do it! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch cushions; no brainer, right? Max that out before anything else.

2. **IRA Time**: After you've snagged that match, hit up your IRA. Go with a Roth IRA if you plan on being a big-shot in the future and want to pay taxes now rather than later. Itâ€™s like pre-paying for a future pizza; you know you want it!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, for the fun stuff! Once you've stuffed your tax-advantaged options, start throwing cash into your taxable account. It gives you flexibility to access funds without strings attached, but watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Keep your investments spicy! Stocks for growth, bonds for that cozy stability, and maybe a little crypto if youâ€™re feeling adventurous (or a little reckless). Just remember, keep your risky stuff in tax-advantaged accounts to dodge those tax bullets.

5. **Adjust as You Age**: As you get older, pivot to safer investments. No one wants to go all-in on stocks right before retirementâ€”it's like betting your life savings on red at the roulette table!

In short, diversify, maximize your free money, and pay attention to those taxes. And, hey, consult a financial advisor if you want to play it safeâ€”because adulting is hard!
