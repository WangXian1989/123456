I'm not a doctor, but there are various treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition.

Medications may also be prescribed to manage underlying conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, medical procedures or surgery may be necessary. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
