When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies you can consider to optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts, as these accounts offer tax benefits:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you won't pay taxes until you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket currently, a **Traditional IRA** or 401(k) may be more beneficial to reduce your taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider using a **Roth IRA** to benefit from tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - High-growth investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts, as they can be taxed at lower rates.

5. **Know the Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (under 50), $30,000 (50 and over).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (under 50), $7,500 (50 and over).

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for liquidity needs.

By focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged contributions first while being mindful of your overall investment strategy and tax implications, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
