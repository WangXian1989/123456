(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your financial goals, investment horizon, and tax implications. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you have access to employer matching, as this can provide an immediate return on your investment. Then, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. After funding these tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds can be directed towards taxable accounts for flexibility. Diversifying the types of investments held in each account based on their tax treatment can also be beneficial.

Next, depending on your tax situation, think about a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to go up in the future, or a traditional IRA if you want those sweet tax deductions now. Anything leftover? Throw it into your taxable accounts where you can easily access it anytime. Just remember, taxable means youâ€™ll have to pay taxes on gains, so make smart choices with your investments there. The key is balancing tax benefits while keeping future liquidity in mind! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’°
