I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medication to manage symptoms or underlying issues, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. Always seek tailored advice from a medical expert who can evaluate your individual case.
