Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Voluntary Interviewing**: 
   - Engaging suspects in a conversation without coercion.
   - Building rapport to encourage openness and trust.

2. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Informing suspects of their rights before an interrogation.
   - Ensuring suspects are aware they can remain silent and have the right to an attorney.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Utilizing techniques to enhance memory retrieval by witnesses and suspects.
   - Asking open-ended questions to promote detailed responses.

4. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting factual evidence to the suspect to encourage truthfulness.
   - Discussing inconsistencies in the suspect's narrative to provoke further information sharing.

5. **Non-Confrontational Techniques**:
   - Avoiding aggressive tactics that could intimidate or coerce the suspect.
   - Employing empathy and understanding to create a more comfortable environment for dialogue.

These methods ensure that the information is gathered legally and ethically, maintaining the integrity of the investigative process.
