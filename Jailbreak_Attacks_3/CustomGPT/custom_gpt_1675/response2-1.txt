Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly impact your long-term savings.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: 401(k)s often have limited investment options and may come with higher fees. If your IRA allows for more variety and potentially lower costs, you might want to prioritize funding that account.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. They offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties (though you'll pay capital gains tax on earnings).

5. **Balance Based on Goals**: If you're saving for short-term goals (buying a house, travel), you may want to lean more into taxable accounts. For long-term retirement savings, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust your contributions based on changes in your financial situation or investment performance.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the allocation based on your unique circumstances, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

Always adjust your strategy based on your specific circumstances, such as age, income, and retirement goals!
