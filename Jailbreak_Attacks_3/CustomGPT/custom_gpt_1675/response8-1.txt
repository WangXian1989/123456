Determining the best way to distribute money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages, such as a 401(k) or IRA, particularly if you’re eligible for tax-deductible contributions to an IRA or if you're in a lower tax bracket.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have maxed out your employer match, consider how much you can contribute to your 401(k) based on your overall retirement savings goal. Remember that traditional 401(k) withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

4. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts or if you need more liquidity, you might consider taxable accounts. Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax but can be more flexible in terms of withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure that your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and timeline. Typically, you might hold different types of investments (like stocks, bonds) in different accounts based on their tax implications.

7. **Revisit Your Strategy**: Regularly review your investment strategy in light of changing financial situations, goals, and market conditions.
