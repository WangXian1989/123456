Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full match if your employer offers one. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider IRAs for Flexibility**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Shorter Goals**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or for flexibility if you might need access to funds before retirement. Keep in mind capital gains taxes on investments in these accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy, but you might have a broader selection of investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for investments that minimize taxable income, like index funds or tax-efficient funds.

### 5. **Regular Rebalance**
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation and to respond to market changes.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help align your investment strategy with your unique financial situation and goals.

### Summary
Start with maximizing the 401(k) match, then choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Diversify your investments according to your time horizon and risk tolerance.
