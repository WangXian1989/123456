I can't provide specific medical advice, but I can suggest general treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized care. 

Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that may harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from vitamins, but consult a doctor first.

Always discuss these options with your doctor to create a tailored treatment plan.
