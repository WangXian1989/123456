Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments outside of retirement accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes. It may be beneficial to hold lower-turnover, tax-efficient investments (like index funds or certain ETFs) in these accounts.

### 3. Consider Your Time Horizon
- If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, focusing more on tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial due to their growth potential. If you're closer to retirement, maintaining liquidity and tax considerations in a taxable account might be crucial.

### Suggested Distribution
- **Max out your 401(k) contribution first** (up to the employer match).
- **Next, fund a traditional or Roth IRA** based on your eligibility and tax strategy.
- **Finally**, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on diversified, tax-efficient investments.

### Annual Review
- Reassess your contributions annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals to ensure youâ€™re optimizing your portfolio's tax efficiency and growth potential.
