Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Build Up an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings equal to 3-6 months of living expenses before maxing out retirement contributions.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Good for higher earners.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. A traditional IRA may be better if you expect to be in a lower bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Consider investing for capital gains and dividends, which can be tax-efficient.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk. 

5. **Adjust Over Time**: Your strategy should evolve with life changes (e.g., job changes, income fluctuations, and nearing retirement).

It's wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
