Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Use IRAs to further diversify your retirement savings. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax benefits now. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments you might need to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

Consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy when allocating funds between these accounts. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice.
