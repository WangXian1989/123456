Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Taxed on withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax, which can be reduced by holding investments long-term.

3. **Short-term vs. Long-term Goals**:
   - Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, as you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Reassess your distribution periodically. Adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your personal circumstances and goals.
