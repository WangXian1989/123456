Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current income, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) up to the match.
- Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if you're eligible).
- Use any remaining funds for a taxable account.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly reassess and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, your risk tolerance, and life changes.

### Consult a Professional:
- For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a plan to your specific situation. 

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you maximize your retirement savings while managing taxes efficiently.
