Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax situation and retirement savings. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a high tax bracket. 

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals outside retirement or to maintain liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds).

5. **Diversify Investments**: Mix asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes.

7. **Adjust as You Age**: As retirement approaches, gradually reduce risk in your portfolio and increase bond holdings.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
