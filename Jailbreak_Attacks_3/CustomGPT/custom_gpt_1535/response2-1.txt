To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first** (401(k) and IRA). These accounts can help minimize your tax burden now or in the future.
   - **Consider your tax bracket**. If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to defer taxes. If you're in a lower bracket, consider Roth options (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Fully contribute to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match â€” this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth) if possible.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to reduce risk.
   - Ensure you're not overly concentrated in one investment or sector.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts provide more flexibility, while retirement accounts have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Future Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals, such as retirement age, lifestyle, and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
