Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match – this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they offer tax advantages.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income now but are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, making these accounts less tax-efficient for long-term growth.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) & IRA) for higher growth investments like stocks, which can compound over time.
   - Allocate more conservative investments (like bonds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some cash or easily accessible investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs. 

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and retirement goals.

This general guideline will help you create a balanced approach to maximize growth while considering taxes and accessibility.
