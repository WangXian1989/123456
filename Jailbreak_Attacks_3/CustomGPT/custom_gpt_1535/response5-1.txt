Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Debt Management**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily contributing to retirement accounts.

### 3. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to funnel money into your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement contributions, taxable accounts can provide more liquidity and flexibility for mid-term goals.

### 6. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments are diverse and aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts: allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
