Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA to maximize tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically focus on long-term growth investments such as stocks.
   - **IRA**: Balance the risk by considering bonds or other assets, depending on your age and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Needs**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before investing excess funds. This fund should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals or market conditions.
