Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, plus an additional $1,000 if over age 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Tax-Advantaged First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA.
- **Diversity in Investments**: Diversify your asset allocation across all accounts, taking into account risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes and ensure long-term sustainability.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in financial goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
