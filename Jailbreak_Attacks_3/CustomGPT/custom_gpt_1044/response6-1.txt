To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies** 
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement, potentially using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations to maintain desired risk levels and investment goals.

### Key Points
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Keep a mix of investments across all accounts to optimize taxes and growth.

By aligning your strategies with your long-term financial goals, you can create a sustainable distribution plan.
