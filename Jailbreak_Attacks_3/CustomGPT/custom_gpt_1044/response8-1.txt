Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize IRAs**:
   - Consider funding a Roth IRA if your income allows, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, particularly beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you’re eligible for a Traditional IRA, it can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments according to risk tolerance and timelines. For example, higher-risk investments might be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could be in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Monitor your tax situation; prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Each individual’s situation is unique, so consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and objectives.
