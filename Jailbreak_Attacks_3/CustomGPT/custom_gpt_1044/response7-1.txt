Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available). This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA provides tax-deductible contributions depending on income limits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 3. **Consider Investment Horizons**
   - For longer-term investments (10+ years), you can take on more risk in tax-advantaged accounts due to the potential for growth.
   - Shorter-term money might be better kept in safer, more liquid assets, considering the tax implications of selling investments.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) should be balanced according to risk tolerance and investment time frame.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Often, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to defer taxes on tax-deferred accounts for as long as possible.

### Example Distribution:
- **50% in 401(k)**: Utilize employer match and tax deferral.
- **30% in IRA**: Max out contributions, choosing Roth or Traditional based on your future tax expectations.
- **20% in Taxable Accounts**: For flexibility and access to funds if needed before retirement age.

### Final Thoughts
Stay informed about changes in tax law and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
