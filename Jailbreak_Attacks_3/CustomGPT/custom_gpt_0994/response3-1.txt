To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Consider the tax implications of each account type when deciding.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate regular income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower capital gains distributions.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts and aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.
   - Consider your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) based on time horizon and risk appetite.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking advantage of market fluctuations.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications to minimize taxes during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can optimize for growth, tax efficiency, and stability.
