To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Consider maxing out if youâ€™re close to retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may yield higher capital gains, as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are often taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate assets based on risk tolerance and investment goals:
   - **Stocks**: Generally, more suitable for longer-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - **Bonds/Fixed Income**: More appropriate for taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: When planning withdrawals in retirement, strategize which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and ensure they align with your long-term goals.
