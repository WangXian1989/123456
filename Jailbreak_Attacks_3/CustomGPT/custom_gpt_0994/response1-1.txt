Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to traditional or Roth IRAs after your 401(k). These accounts provide tax advantages that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. They can offer liquidity and flexibility, though you’ll pay taxes on capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Higher earners may benefit from traditional accounts to reduce taxable income now, while those in lower brackets might prefer Roth accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**: Young investors might focus on growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement should shift toward more stable, income-generating options.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations at least annually or when your financial situation changes significantly.
