To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, aim to max out contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Evaluate Investment Options:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for investments with lower tax implications (e.g., index funds or ETFs) and for short-term goals, as gains are taxed immediately when sold.
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth longer.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance in each account to optimize growth potential while managing risk.

4. **Review Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay informed about annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your potential savings.

### General Tips
- Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your situation and objectives.
