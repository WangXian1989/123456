Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These accounts are ideal for long-term investments, as they can benefit from favorable capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diverse Investments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Use these for long-term growth investments like stocks, as they benefit from tax deferral. Bonds can also be included for risk management.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) that generate less taxable income.

### 4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation and goals can change, so review your investment strategy periodically.

### Conclusion:
This diversified approach helps maximize growth while managing taxes effectively. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
