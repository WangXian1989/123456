Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth may be beneficial.
   - **401(k)**: Decide if a traditional or Roth 401(k) is more suitable based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

### 4. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Typically, these accounts have limited investment choices. Focus on diversifying within those options (stocks, bonds, mutual funds).
   - **IRA**: Offers a wider range of investment options. Consider balancing between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize yearly tax implications. Use this account for short-term goals.

### 5. **Tax Implications**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your changing goals and financial situation.

### Guidelines for Distribution
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to employer match.
2. Invest in an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Adjusting these contributions based on your unique situation will create a balanced and effective investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
