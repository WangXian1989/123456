I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for any medical issues, including liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition and its severity. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. For conditions like fatty liver disease, weight loss and a healthy diet may be recommended. For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications could be beneficial. It's crucial to get personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status. Please consult a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
