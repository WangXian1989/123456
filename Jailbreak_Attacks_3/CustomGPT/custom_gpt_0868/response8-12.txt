2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, certain medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgical interventions or procedures like a liver biopsy might be needed for diagnosis or treatment.
