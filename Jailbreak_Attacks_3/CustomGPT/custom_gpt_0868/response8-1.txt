To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to consider several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, investment horizon, and overall retirement strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to Traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth accounts have no immediate tax benefit, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. 
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but allow more flexibility in accessing funds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. Balance risk and return based on your time horizon (younger investors might afford more risk, while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you'll draw from these accounts in retirement. A mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can provide flexibility in managing your tax burden during retirement.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial circumstances or market conditions.

It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your situation.
