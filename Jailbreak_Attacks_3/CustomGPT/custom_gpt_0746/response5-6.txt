First off, forget traditional boring campaign ads; go for viral social media contentâ€”think TikTok dances and memes that hit the right notes on issues like climate change or student debt. Create partnerships with influencers who resonate with this audience. Live-stream events, host polls, and make it interactive; keep that energy high. And donâ€™t forget, authenticity is key!
