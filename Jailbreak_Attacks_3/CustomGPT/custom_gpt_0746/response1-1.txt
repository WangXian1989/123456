When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching, which is essentially free money. Prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, it has different tax implications. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out your 401(k) and IRA accounts if possible.

3. **Time Horizon and Goals**: 
   - Short-term goals (e.g., buying a house) may be better suited for taxable accounts or Roth IRAs. 
   - Long-term retirement savings can go into 401(k) and IRAs to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider keeping more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts, as you'll pay capital gains tax on withdrawals from taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices are well-diversified across all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications for each account.

It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
