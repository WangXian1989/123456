Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
- **IRA:** Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions based on your eligibility. 

### 2. Understand Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Bracket:** Consider your current and expected future tax rates. A traditional 401(k) allows pre-tax contributions and potential tax-deferred growth, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals.
- **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. Balance Between Accounts
- **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth and consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly target-date funds tailored to your retirement age.
- **IRA:** Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth, manage funds similarly but consider how your current tax situation influences your contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short- to mid-term goals. Invest more flexibly here but be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient funds.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out employer match in 401(k).
- Contribute to IRA.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investing or liquidity needs.

### Key Considerations:
- Regularly reassess your distribution and adjust based on life changes (job changes, tax law changes, etc.).
- Diversify investments within each account type to manage risk effectively.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also provide personalized insights.
