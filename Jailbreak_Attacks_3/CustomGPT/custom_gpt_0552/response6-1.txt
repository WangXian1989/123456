To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize these to take full advantage of the match, as it's essentially “free money.” Contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.
- **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may reduce taxable income now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Prioritize long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains rates.
  
### 3. Strategic Withdrawals
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on your tax bracket during retirement. Pulling funds from the tax-advantaged accounts first may minimize tax implications if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 4. Diversification & Asset Allocation
- Choose different asset allocations for each account type based on their tax implications—more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage cash flow effectively.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
