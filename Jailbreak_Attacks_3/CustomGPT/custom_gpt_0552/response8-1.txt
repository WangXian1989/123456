The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on factors like your current tax situation, your retirement timeline, investment goals, and individual preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer-Matched Contributions:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If you have maxed out your match, consider contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k) to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth and withdrawals. For Traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income level and tax filing status.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Utilize low-turnover, tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which can help minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Diversification:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.

5. **Asset Location Strategy:** Consider holding assets that are more tax-efficient (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient assets (like REITs or high-yield bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Adjust as Needed:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to craft a distribution strategy tailored to your unique situation.
