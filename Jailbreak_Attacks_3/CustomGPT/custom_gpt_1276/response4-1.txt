Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if you have a high tax rate, as contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, a Traditional IRA might be preferable for tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially useful for investments you plan to access before retirement, as they don’t have early withdrawal penalties.

4. **Asset Location:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds).

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets in taxable accounts, and consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
