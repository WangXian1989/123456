To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 or $30,000 if over 50 for 2024).
   - **IRA:** Consider a Traditional or Roth IRA. If eligible, contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Use these for investments you plan to hold long-term.
   - Prioritize investments like bonds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Balance your asset allocation within each account based on your risk tolerance. For example, a more aggressive portfolio in your 401(k) or IRA can be offset by conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor the performance and tax implications of each account. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

By following these steps, you can strategically distribute your money for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
