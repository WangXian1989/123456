Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matches. Contributions are pre-tax (reducing taxable income) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA:** Allows for tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Taxed on capital gains and dividends. Offers flexibility for withdrawals but less favorable tax treatment.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** If you’re eligible, contribute to an IRA next. This provides additional tax advantages, especially with a Roth IRA.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once you’ve maximized retirement accounts. They’re useful for short-term goals.

### 3. **Consider Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA (Tax-Advantaged):** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs) since withdrawals are usually taxed later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, tax-managed funds) to minimize tax burden.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Consider Time Horizon and Future Needs:**
   - If planning for retirement in the near term, prioritize liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - For longer-term goals, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match, then aim for the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the maximum allowed annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds to invest, focusing on capital preservation and tax efficiency.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By carefully balancing these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing your tax exposure.
