Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the match, then consider maxing out your contributions if possible. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Aim to max out your IRA next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need in the short term or for investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds). Consider holding investments that produce long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might favor a more aggressive approach with a higher equity allocation.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your investments to ensure they align with your goals and adjust your contributions as needed based on market changes and personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

This approach can help you optimize your investments while minimizing your tax burden.
