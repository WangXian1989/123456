Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves balancing tax advantages, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, but you can offset some of this with tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k):** Generally consider more aggressive investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), but consider a mix of bonds and stocks based on retirement timing.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Aim for tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes (e.g., job changes, income fluctuations).

### Summary

Balancing contributions across accounts allows for optimal tax efficiency and growth potential. Always align your investment choices with your long-term financial goals and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
