Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Take advantage of any employer match as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum allowable amount if possible, especially if your tax bracket is high.
   - Consider using a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing contributions here for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - For a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - Evaluate any income limits that may affect Roth IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this account for investments that may generate interest or dividends, as these can be taxed at a higher rate.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep some liquidity for short-term needs and emergencies.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, maximize contributions in your IRA, especially if you're interested in tax-free growth.
- **Fill Your 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, continue to boost your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining money for taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re younger and have a long investment horizon, you may favor more aggressive investments.
- **Tax Bracket**: Higher-income individuals may benefit from maxing out tax-deferred accounts first.
- **Withdrawal Needs**: Consider your expected cash flow needs in retirement and how it aligns with account taxation.
