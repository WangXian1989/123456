Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can offer tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Utilize 401(k) Up to Contribution Limit**: After getting the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may provide liquidity and flexibility. This is ideal for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes over time.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically, adjusting for life changes, market conditions, and changes in tax law.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
