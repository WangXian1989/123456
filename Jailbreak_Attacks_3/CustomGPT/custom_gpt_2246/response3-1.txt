Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement. They offer more flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Common options include stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and rebalance to maintain your desired asset mix.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
