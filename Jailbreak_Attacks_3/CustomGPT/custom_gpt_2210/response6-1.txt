The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, financial goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Allocate funds here after maxing out your 401(k) if eligible. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may be preferable for current tax reduction.

### 2. **Consider Asset Location**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or municipal bonds here, as they generate fewer taxable distributions.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Hold investments with higher expected returns or those that generate high amounts of taxable income, such as bonds or actively managed funds, here to defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Allocate a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Typically:
     - **Younger Investors:** Favor stocks for growth.
     - **Older Investors:** Increase bonds to preserve capital as retirement approaches.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**
   - Monitor market conditions, changes in tax laws, and personal circumstances. Adjust contributions based on performance and retirement goals.

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Implications:** Understand the tax consequences of withdrawals and gains in each account type.
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account to maximize benefits.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
