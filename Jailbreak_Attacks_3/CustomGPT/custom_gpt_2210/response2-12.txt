I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These may reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and any progression of liver disease.

4. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some supplements like milk thistle are believed to support liver health, but consult with a doctor before use.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
