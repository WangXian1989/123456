Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. Consider increasing your contributions up to the annual limit if you're not fully utilizing it.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings. This allows more flexibility and access, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment strategy based on account type:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Favor growth investments like stocks since these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider including tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, it’s beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your unique situation.

This approach aims to leverage benefits from each account type while managing tax implications effectively.
