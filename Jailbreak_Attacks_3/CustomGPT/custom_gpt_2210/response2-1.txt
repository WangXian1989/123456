Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), depending on the plan. Use traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose Roth if you expect higher future taxes; traditional if you want immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year, benefiting from tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Ideal for short to mid-term goals (e.g., home purchase, vacation).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Recommendations**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified to manage risk better.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and financial goals.

### **Considerations**:
- **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might prioritize growth investments, while those closer to retirement could focus on capital preservation.
- **Investment Horizon**: Longer time horizons can afford more volatility; shorter ones should prioritize stability.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
