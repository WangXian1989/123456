Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially "free money"). If possible, maximize contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need in the short term (like an emergency fund) or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which have favorable tax rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, since these accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You might include more liquid or lower-growth investments here, as they may be accessed without penalties if you need funds early.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For retirement savings, lean towards aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRA accounts. For shorter-term goals, favor more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as necessary to align with your goals.

### General Distribution Example (Hypothetical):
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

### Consult a Financial Advisor
It's beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

### Conclusion
Strategically allocating your money across these accounts helps maximize growth while minimizing taxes. Adjust based on changing financial conditions, goals, and tax laws.
