To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. It's a great way to maximize your contributions while reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds). Consider higher-risk options since withdrawals will be years away.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for more liquid investments. Consider tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) and tax-managed strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash equivalents) across all accounts to spread risk.

### 4. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - In retirement, plan withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts first to minimize taxes, followed by taxable accounts as needed.

### 5. **Reassess Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions, life events, and changes in financial goals.

This balanced approach ensures optimal tax treatment while preparing for future financial needs.
