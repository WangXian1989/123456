Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should take into account factors like tax implications, fees, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, consider contributing to that next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contributions, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions to the annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you'll need before retirement or to invest in assets that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Maintain Flexibility**: Keep in mind your liquidity needs and any potential taxes on withdrawals. 

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and investment performance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
