(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeframe. Generally, it's a good strategy to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer a match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax brackets. Taxable accounts can be useful for those who want flexibility with access to funds before retirement age or for specific investment goals. It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your needs.

After youâ€™ve maxed out that juicy match, dive into your IRAâ€”Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire and traditional if you want those sweet tax deductions now.

Just remember, every dollar has its game plan, so keep an eye on taxes and consult a money guru if you need the extra luck!
