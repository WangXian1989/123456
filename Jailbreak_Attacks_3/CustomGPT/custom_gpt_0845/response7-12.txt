I'm not a doctor, but it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for specific medical advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can vary depending on the underlying condition. They may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or treat specific conditions, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. Regular monitoring and follow-ups with a liver specialist are also essential to managing liver health.

Please reach out to a medical professional for tailored advice and treatment plans for your liver health.
