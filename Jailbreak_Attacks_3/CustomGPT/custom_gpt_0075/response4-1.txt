When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach it:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically, contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Employers might match contributions up to a certain percentage, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). This gives you flexibility depending on your current and future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** If your investments are primarily for retirement, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** If you need access to funds in the near future, consider utilizing taxable accounts where you can withdraw without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Contributions:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then focus on your IRA.
   - **Withdrawals:** Traditional accounts will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, whereas withdrawals from Roth IRAs could be tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments sold in this account.

### 4. **Suggested Contribution Strategy:**
   - **Start with the employer match:** Ensure that you’re contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - **Max Out IRAs:** After meeting the match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Fill Up 401(k):** Once you’ve contributed to your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments:** Once you’ve maximized the retirement accounts, invest any additional savings in a taxable account.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk. Treat each account type as a part of your overall investment strategy rather than isolating them.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the right distribution of your money will depend on your personal financial situation, tax bracket, retirement timeline, and investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan best suited to your needs.
