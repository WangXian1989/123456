(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. A general approach is to maximize your contributions to the accounts that offer tax advantages first. For example, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then max out an IRA if eligible. After these accounts are maximized, you can then allocate funds to your taxable accounts. Itâ€™s also useful to assess the investment options available in each account and your long-term strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
