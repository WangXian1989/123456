Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several key factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax advantages, either deducting contributions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth). Consider your income and tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible but lack tax advantages. Useful for short-term goals or once retirement accounts are maxed out.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match (401(k)):** Start here, as it’s free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Max Out 401(k):** After the match, prioritize contributions toward your 401(k) up to the legal limit.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments beyond your retirement accounts once they’re maxed.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Generally invest for the long term with a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Review Your Taxes:**
   - Understand how withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed, and strategize to minimize tax implications during retirement. Keep an eye on capital gains taxes for taxable accounts.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust contributions based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Approach:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Continue maximizing 401(k) contributions.
4. Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient assets.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on your circumstances, you maximize your investment potential while considering tax efficiency and your financial goals.
