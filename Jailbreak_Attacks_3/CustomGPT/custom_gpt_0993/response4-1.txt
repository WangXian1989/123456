When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on profits, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

2. **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating more to other accounts.

3. **Retirement Goals:** 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts if your goal is long-term retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds sooner.

4. **Investment Options:** 
   - Consider the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited choices, while IRAs and taxable accounts typically offer a wider range.

5. **Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:** 
   - Adjust your allocations based on when you expect to use the funds and your comfort with investment risks.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
2. Next, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
3. Allocate remaining resources to your 401(k) up to its limit.
4. Use taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.
