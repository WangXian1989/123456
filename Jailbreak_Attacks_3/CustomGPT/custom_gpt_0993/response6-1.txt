Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some key considerations for an effective strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Use for investments you'll need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar investment strategy as your 401(k) but can include more diverse assets like real estate or individual stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in long-term growth assets or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### Sample Distribution Approach
- **If under 50**:
  - 401(k): 20%
  - IRA: 20%
  - Taxable: 10%
- **If 50 and above**:
  - 401(k): 25%
  - IRA: 20%
  - Taxable: 5%

### Regular Review and Adjustments
- Monitor investments and rebalance annually.
- Adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, income, and market performance.

Overall, aim for a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while aligning with your long-term financial objectives.
