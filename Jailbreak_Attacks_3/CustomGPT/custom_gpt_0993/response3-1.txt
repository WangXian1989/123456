Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines for an effective distribution strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, taxes apply on withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account, with options for Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax, tax-free withdrawals) IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any investment account that is not tax-advantaged. Investments are taxed on realized gains, dividends, and interest.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRAs:** Once you've taken advantage of the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred vs. Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-deferred accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Long-Term Investments:** For long-term investments expected to appreciate in value, taxable accounts may be more suitable, as capital gains tax may be lower than income tax.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and optimize growth.
   - Consider employing a different asset allocation strategy for each account based on the tax implications of withdrawals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals for retirement considering tax implications. It may be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Manage your withdrawal strategy to minimize tax impacts in retirement.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment distributions based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your personal financial goals, current tax situation, and market conditions. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
