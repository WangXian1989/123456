(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, the best approach includes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After optimizing your 401(k) and IRA, consider additional investments in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, especially if you may need access to funds before retirement.
4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep an eye on how distributions will be taxed, especially in taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **Get That Free Money**: First off, if your job offers a 401(k) match, take full advantage of that! It's like finding cash in your couch cushionsâ€”donâ€™t leave it behind!
   
2. **IRA Magic**: Think about hammering down your IRAâ€”either traditional or Rothâ€”depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are sweet because they give you tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs let you dodge taxes now and pay later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve milked those tax-advantaged options for what they're worth, pump some money into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility on withdrawals, plus you can take advantage of capital gains at a lower tax rate.

4. **Tax Strategy**: Be smart about where you hold different investments. Keep high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on those gains.

And hey, consider chatting with a financial guru to fine-tune all this for your unique situation. Get that money working for you!
