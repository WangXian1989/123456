(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more effectively. 

You might consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or dividends, as they will be taxed differently than income.

4. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure your overall portfolio remains diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

First off, max out that 401(k) enough to snag the full employer matchâ€”think of it as free cash raining from above. Next, if youâ€™re eligible, dive headfirst into an IRA. A Roth IRA lets your money grow tax-free, which is super sweet for your future self.

After hitting those tax-advantaged accounts, shift some cash to taxable accounts for flexibility. You can invest in stocks or ETFs that dish out capital gains and keep dividends flowing without getting slammed in taxesâ€”because who likes taxes, right? And for the love of all things financial, donâ€™t forget to keep an eye on your investments and tweak your allocations based on life changes or market trends. Financial freedom is the name of the gameâ€”letâ€™s play it smart!
