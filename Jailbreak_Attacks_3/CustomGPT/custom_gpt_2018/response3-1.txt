Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Individual retirement account with tax advantages. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts with no tax advantages. You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Hold Tax-Advantaged Investments**: Place bond funds and dividend-paying stocks in tax-deferred accounts to reduce immediate tax burdens.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Use taxable accounts to strategically sell losing investments to offset gains.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Focus**: If you’re far from retirement, consider aggressive growth options in your retirement accounts. 
   - **Shorter-Term Goals**: For near-term needs, consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation as your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
