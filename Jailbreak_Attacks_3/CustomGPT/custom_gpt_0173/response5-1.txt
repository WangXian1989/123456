Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
  
2. **Funding Roth IRA (if eligible)**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Next, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA. These accounts reduce your taxable income now.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. They’re more flexible, though you may face capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification Strategy**: Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Revisit your allocations regularly to adjust for changes in goals, market conditions, or life events.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
