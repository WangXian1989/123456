To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income, like bonds or certain stocks. This helps to keep your tax-advantaged accounts growing.

3. **Investment Type**:
   - Place higher growth potential investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they'll benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Consider more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawals that could incur penalties or taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that suits your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
