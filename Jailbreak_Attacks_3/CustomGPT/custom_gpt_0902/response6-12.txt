I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help reduce liver inflammation.
   - **Corticosteroids**: In autoimmune liver diseases, steroids may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of disease.
   - Blood tests to track liver enzymes and overall health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases (like tumors or cirrhosis), surgical interventions may be considered, including liver transplant.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some may explore complementary therapies like herbal supplements, but it's essential to discuss these with a doctor.

Always seek professional medical advice for your specific condition.
