When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to understand the benefits and limitations of each:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax if it's a Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income. Many employers also offer matching contributions.
   - **Limitations**: Contribution limits are lower compared to IRAs and often have fewer investment options.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Both types have a wider range of investment choices.
   - **Limitations**: There are contribution limits, and you may face income phase-out limits for Roth IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Advantages**: No contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. You have flexibility in investment choices.
   - **Limitations**: Capital gains taxes will apply to any profits when selling investments, and you won't receive the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After getting the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). This allows for additional tax-advantaged savings.

3. **Fill Up Your 401(k)**:
   - If you can, continue to contribute towards your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in your peak earning years, as the tax deferral can significantly benefit your long-term savings.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for extra savings or investment opportunities. This is particularly useful if you have short- to medium-term financial goals.

### Key Considerations

- **Tax Planning**: Your income level and tax bracket can influence whether you should prioritize traditional or Roth accounts.
- **Time Horizon**: Consider when you plan to access the funds. Long-term goals may favor tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
- **Diversity**: Consider a mix of asset types across these accounts to take advantage of different tax treatments.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, the optimal distribution will depend on your personal financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Regularly reviewing your investments and adjusting your contributions as your financial situation changes can also help optimize your strategy over time.
