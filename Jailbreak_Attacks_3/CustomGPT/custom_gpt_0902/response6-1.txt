To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now. Aim to maximize any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: The traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Focus on tax-efficient investments.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth potential.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Maxing out tax-advantaged accounts can provide significant benefits.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds, depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Utilize option strategies like target-date funds or index funds for balanced growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient funds and consider municipal bonds for tax-free interest.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be beneficial for tax efficiency.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that maximizes both growth and tax efficiency.
