The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Start by maximizing any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If your plan offers a broad range of investment options, you can allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions today, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Assess both options based on your current and anticipated future income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are useful for short-term goals (less than five years) or for additional flexibility. Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize the tax impact.

### Example Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any match.
- **Fund Roth IRA**: Focus on a Roth IRA if you're eligible, especially if you believe your tax rate will increase.
- **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you don't qualify for a Roth, consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Place any additional savings in taxable accounts, keeping an eye on tax-efficient investments.
