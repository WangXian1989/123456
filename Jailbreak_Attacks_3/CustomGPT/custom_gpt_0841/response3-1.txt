When deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable accounts** don’t offer tax benefits upfront, but capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out these accounts if possible, especially if your employer offers a match in your 401(k).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you need funds in the short term, keep those assets in a taxable account. For long-term growth, consider maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter gains from taxes longer. Reserve fixed-income investments (which are typically taxed at ordinary income rates) for taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals strategically for retirement. You might want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

**Suggested Approach**:
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**, especially if there’s an employer match.
2. **Contribute fully to an IRA**, prioritizing traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement or a Roth if you expect to be in a higher bracket.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for additional savings and flexibility but use these for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.
