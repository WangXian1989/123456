The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is often considered "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize maxing out your retirement accounts for long-term tax deferral.
   - **Short to Medium-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for money you expect to access in the next few years.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance (stocks vs. bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to reduce capital gains tax.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Long-term capital gains (hold investments for over a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Summary
By strategically prioritizing contributions, understanding tax implications, and reviewing your asset allocation, you can maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
