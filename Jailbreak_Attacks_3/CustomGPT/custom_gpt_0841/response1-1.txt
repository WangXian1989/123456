Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, direct additional contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments once you’ve maxed out the tax-advantaged accounts. Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to reflect changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
