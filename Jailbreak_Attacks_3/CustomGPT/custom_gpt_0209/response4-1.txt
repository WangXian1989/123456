Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first, then consider maxing it out depending on your circumstances.
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, max out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth).

3. **Build a Taxable Investment Account**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Traditional accounts offer tax deferral, whereas Roth accounts provide tax-free growth. Align your contributions with your current tax bracket and anticipated future income.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well diversified to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Life changes and market conditions can impact your strategy. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and goals.
