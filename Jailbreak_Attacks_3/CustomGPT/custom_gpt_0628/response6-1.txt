Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred, so you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay taxes on earnings annually, but there’s no limit on contributions or withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Contributions and Matching:**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Consider funding your IRA next, particularly if you qualify for tax benefits.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or if you are near retirement and want flexibility without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications on interest and dividends.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your strategies based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

### 5. **General Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts.
   - **Medium to Long-Term Goals:** Consider using a mix of IRAs and 401(k)s.
   - **Retirement Focus:** Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first.

### Summary:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions for employer matching.**
- **Contribute to IRA accounts strategically based on tax implications.**
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs.**

This approach helps in optimizing your tax efficiency and aligns better with your overall financial objectives. If you have specific numerical goals or needs, further fine-tuning can enhance the strategy.
