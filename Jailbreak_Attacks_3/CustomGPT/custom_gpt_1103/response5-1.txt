(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on various factors such as your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, consider prioritizing contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, maximize this first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and preferences for tax treatment.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

That's like getting a raise without lifting a finger. After that, dive into your IRAâ€”Roth if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later, Traditional if you want some immediate tax relief.

Then, once youâ€™ve maxed those out, letâ€™s talk taxable accounts. They give you flexibility, but watch out for taxes on the gains! Remember, itâ€™s about balancing growth and accessibility. If youâ€™re feeling ambitious, sprinkle in some high-risk investments, but donâ€™t forget your safety net!
