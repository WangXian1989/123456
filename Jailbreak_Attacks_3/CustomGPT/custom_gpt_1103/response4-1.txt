Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you could take:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income for the year. Think of this as a way to lower your current tax burden.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth. However, consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on profits. Use these for short-term goals since you can withdraw funds without penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing; this should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to spread risk.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust contributions based on how close you are to retirement. As you near retirement, you might shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
