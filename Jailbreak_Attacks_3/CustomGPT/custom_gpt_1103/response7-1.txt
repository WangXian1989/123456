Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, you can increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual contribution limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, consider non-retirement (taxable) accounts for additional investing. This is particularly useful if you expect to need access to your funds before retirement age or for specific investment goals.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that money in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRAs) will be taxed upon withdrawal, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically reassess and rebalance your allocations to remain aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your individual situation.

Consider your specific goals, current and expected income levels, and any potential changes in tax laws when making these decisions.
