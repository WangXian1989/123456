To optimize the distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Consider Tax Impact and Investment Goals**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you may need to access in the short to medium term. This account can hold investments that are more tax-efficient, such as qualified dividend stocks and index funds.
   - Monitor asset location; keep higher tax assets (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing lower tax assets (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified across asset classes, even within different account types.
   - Use a mix of stock, bond, and other investments tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions if necessary based on performance and changing financial goals.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
