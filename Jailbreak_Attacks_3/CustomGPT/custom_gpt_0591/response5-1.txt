(üîíNormal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your age, investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money. 

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA may provide current tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: It's crucial to spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all your accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation and market conditions change, adjust your asset allocation accordingly to stay aligned with your goals.

Consulting with a financial adviser may provide you with a tailored plan that considers your specific situation and goals.
