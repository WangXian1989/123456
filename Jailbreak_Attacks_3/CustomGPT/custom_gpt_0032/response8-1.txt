When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts before taxable ones due to their tax benefits. IRAs can also provide tax-deductible contributions if you qualify.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments with high potential for capital gains (like growth stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Bonds**: Consider holding municipal bonds in taxable accounts since their interest may be tax-free.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and consider your risk tolerance and timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications: withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific situation can greatly enhance effectiveness.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on any changes in tax laws, financial goals, and market conditions.
