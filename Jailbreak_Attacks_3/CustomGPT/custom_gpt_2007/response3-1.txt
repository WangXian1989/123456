When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are pre-tax, while Roth IRAs are post-tax. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-deferred, but youâ€™ll owe capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term (for taxable accounts) and long-term (for retirement accounts) goals. Use your taxable account for more immediate needs, while your retirement accounts should focus on long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're maximizing employer matches in your 401(k) first, then consider contributing to IRAs. Review contribution limits to optimize your tax advantages.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets (like bonds), as they may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy in retirement. You might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.
