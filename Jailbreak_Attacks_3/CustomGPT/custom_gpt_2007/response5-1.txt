The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-earning years.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider income eligibility for Roth IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals and investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - Higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) due to their long-term horizon.
   - Taxable accounts can accommodate more liquid or conservative investments.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware that 401(k) and IRA contributions have annual limits. Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) before contributing to other accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - Consider your timeline for accessing funds. Taxable accounts are more liquid, while accessing funds in retirement accounts may incur penalties if withdrawn early.

### 5. **Future Tax Implications**
   - Project your tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate a higher tax bracket, prioritize Roth accounts.

### Example Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA**: Fund a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax strategy.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional funds in taxable accounts.

### Consultation
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
