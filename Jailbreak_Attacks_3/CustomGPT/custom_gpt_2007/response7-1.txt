Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Consider maxing out contributions since growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits.

### 2. **IRA Investments**
   - **Tax Advantages:** A traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Balance Tax Diversification:** Mix IRA contributions to include both traditional and Roth accounts based on your current and anticipated tax brackets.
   - **Investment Options:** Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts allow for withdrawals without penalty, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Consider Bond Investments:** Holding bonds in a taxable account may result in higher tax liabilities due to interest income.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Aggressive Growth Phase:** Prioritize maxing out the 401(k) and IRA.
- **Mid-Life Adjustments:** Shift some investment focus to taxable accounts as retirement nears, giving you more liquidity.
- **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals:** When withdrawing, consider tapping taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Final Considerations:
- **Regular Reviews:** Reassess your distribution strategy annually.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor your approach based on personal circumstances and changes in tax laws.

This balanced approach can help optimize your retirement savings and tax strategy.
