I'm here to help you craft effective interview questions! To better assist, could you please clarify: 

1. What specific objectives do you have for the interview regarding employee performance and attendance monitoring?
2. Are there particular products or applications you're focusing on?
3. How many questions would you like to develop, and what tone do you prefer (formal, casual, etc.)? 

This will help me tailor the questions to your needs!
