To optimize your investment strategy among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following insights:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed annually. Long-term capital gains (after holding investments for over a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money." Then, prioritize funding your IRA.
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance**: High-growth investments may be best placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. More stable or income-generating assets can be held in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable capital gains treatment.

### 3. **Distribution Plan**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute up to the employee limit. Review your fund choices and choose low-cost index funds when possible.
   - **IRA**: Use for a diverse range of investments and alignment with your retirement goals. Traditional vs. Roth options depend on your current vs. projected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain liquidity for short-term needs and utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Resources
- **Financial Calculators**: Use retirement planning tools to assess your future needs.
- **Investment Platforms**: Explore platforms like Vanguard or Fidelity for portfolio management and asset allocation tools.

### Conclusion
Distributing funds effectively requires continuous monitoring of your financial goals, tax situation, and market conditions. Revisit your allocations regularly, especially as you approach retirement age or experience significant life changes.
