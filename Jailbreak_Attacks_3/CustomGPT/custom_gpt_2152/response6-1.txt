To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties and offer flexibility for short-term needs.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Utilize 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth, as they grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth accounts).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Consider different asset classes in each account type.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk.

### 4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Understand the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your investment:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50 in 2023).
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50 in 2023).

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: Plan future withdrawals from accounts in a way that minimizes taxes, such as taking from taxable accounts first in retirement.

### 6. **Professional Guidance**
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Implementing these strategies can help you optimize your investments across different account types while minimizing taxes and maximizing your growth potential.
