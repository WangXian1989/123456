Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth or Traditional IRA. These can offer tax reductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate money to taxable accounts for liquidity and more versatile investment options. This can be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. For instance, withdrawals from a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Assess Your Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors might favor higher growth investments, while those closer to retirement might shift to more stable options.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
