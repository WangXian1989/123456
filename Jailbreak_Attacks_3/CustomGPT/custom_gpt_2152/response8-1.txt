To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits, but also consider eligibility for deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for funds that you may need before retirement, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Review Fees and Investment Options**: Check for high fees, especially in 401(k) plans, and opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation, income, and goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments for growth and tax efficiency.
