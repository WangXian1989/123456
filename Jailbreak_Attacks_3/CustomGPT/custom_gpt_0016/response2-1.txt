The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match first. If you're in a high tax bracket, consider contributing more since contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have enough savings to cover 3-6 months of expenses in an easily accessible account. This can alleviate the need to withdraw from your investment accounts in case of unforeseen circumstances.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and can provide capital gains and dividends that may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Within all accounts, be sure to diversify your investments to manage risk. Diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors can help in achieving a balanced portfolio.

6. **Consider Your Age and Retirement Goals**: Your asset allocation might change as you approach retirement age. Generally, younger investors may allocate more to stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may consider a more conservative approach with bonds and cash.

7. **Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts. For example, 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, whereas qualified distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

8. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your investment strategy and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired level of risk and to accommodate changes in your financial goals.

Itâ€™s recommendable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that aligns with your personal circumstances, risk tolerance, and long-term financial goals.
