Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and the rules governing each account type. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k) plan, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money and should be your first step.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
    - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
    - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
    - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized. Consider placing investments expected to generate high turnover in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Account Types Based on Investment Horizon**:
    - For long-term growth, consider placing equities in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) where they can grow without annual tax implications.
    - Fixed-income investments that generate regular income might be better suited for taxable accounts due to their tax treatment.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating all your savings towards retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across your accounts. This may involve different asset allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances can vary greatly, so it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By taking these factors into account, you can create a thoughtful and effective distribution strategy for your savings across these accounts.
