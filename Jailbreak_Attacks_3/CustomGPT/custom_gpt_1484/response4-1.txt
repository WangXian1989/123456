It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money across different accounts! Hereâ€™s a brief overview to help you:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer matching.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Consider if you want to pay taxes now (Roth) or in retirement (Traditional).
   - **Diversification**: Invest in a broad range of assets; consider index funds or ETFs for lower fees.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these for goals before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) rather than interest income to minimize taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize growth.
- Balance your taxable accounts with more liquid assets for short-term needs.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.
