Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's free money!

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term investments or if you've maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation!
