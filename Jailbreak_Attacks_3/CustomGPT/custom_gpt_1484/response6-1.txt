To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** Determine when you plan to retire.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Understand your current and expected future tax brackets.

### 2. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (itâ€™s essentially free money).
     - Consider pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA:**
     - Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement for tax-free withdrawals.
     - Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Useful for assets you may need before retirement age.
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio as needed.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan withdrawals in retirement from the accounts with the most favorable tax implications.

By strategically dividing funds across these accounts, you can optimize for growth while managing tax implications effectively.
