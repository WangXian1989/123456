(üîíNormal Output) When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Contributions Limits:** Maximize your 401(k) contributions first, especially if there's an employer match. Then, contribute to an IRA if eligible.
2. **Tax Implications:** 401(k) and IRAs offer tax advantages (like tax deferrals or deductions), while taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits.
3. **Investment Goals:** Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider using tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments.
4. **Withdrawal Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals, which is useful for short-term goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor the strategy to your personal situation.
