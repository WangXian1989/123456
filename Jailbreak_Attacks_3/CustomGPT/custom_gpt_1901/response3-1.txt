Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to help you allocate your funds:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum you can (up to the limit) to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider this option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If not, a traditional IRA can still offer tax advantages.

3. **Determine Your Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - If you’re saving for retirement in the long term, lean towards growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals, keep more liquid assets in your taxable account.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are taxed at a lower rate or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means spreading investments among various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, it’s often beneficial to work with a financial expert.

By considering these factors, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth while minimizing tax burdens.
