Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **Limit Contributions**: After the match, consider whether to maximize contributions up to the annual limit, which is $22,500 for 2024 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Assessment of Tax Benefits**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free on withdrawal).
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute up to the IRA limit ($6,500 for 2024, $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest Excess Funds**: Use taxable accounts for money that exceeds your 401(k) and IRA limits, or for funds you expect to need sooner.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - **Taxable First**: Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Assess Tax Bracket**: Strategically withdraw from IRAs and 401(k)s to manage your tax bracket in retirement.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation and goals.
