Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan often with matching contributions; grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth) also grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains in the year they're realized but offer more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Max out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, try to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you’ve optimized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on diversified, low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement date.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k); consider bond funds or other lower-risk options if you’re closer to retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket and potential future tax bracket. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Harvest tax losses in your taxable account to offset gains.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

This strategy should provide a solid foundation for distributing your money effectively among your retirement and investment accounts.
