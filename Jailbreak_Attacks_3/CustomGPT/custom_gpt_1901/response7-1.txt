Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The tax-deferred growth can significantly enhance your savings over time. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment choices, monitor this closely.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized the contributions to your 401(k) and IRA(s), consider allocating funds to taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility, as there are no penalties for early withdrawals, and you have access to a broader range of investment options. Keep in mind, investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Typically, you might allocate a higher percentage to stocks when you're younger and shift to bonds as you approach retirement.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding bonds or actively managed funds in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax exposure.

7. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your investments and allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. 

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
