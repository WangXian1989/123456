Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are limited based on income.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for mid-term goals (like purchasing a home) or if you want quicker access to funds. These accounts can also be beneficial for tax-loss harvesting.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments since taxes can be deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider holding investments that are likely to grow significantly, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor more conservative investments and those that generate qualified dividends to reduce capital gains tax.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your investments’ performance and adjust as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Fees and Costs**: Pay attention to investment fees in your accounts; opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.

8. **Long-Term Strategy**: Always align your distributions with your long-term financial goals. 

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances.
