To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for assets that generate capital gains or interest income since they can be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.
   - **Loss Harvesting:** Offset gains in taxable accounts by strategically selling underperforming investments.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Spread investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. For instance, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and conservative investments in taxable ones. 

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you want to withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies may include withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By following these principles, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
