Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   
### 2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** If you're decades away from retirement, focus on stocks and growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of compounding.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds for shorter-term goals in your taxable accounts, where you can more easily access your money without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Use these for less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) that generate interest income.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation. Different accounts may require different strategies based on their tax implications and your investment goals.

### 5. **Personal Goals and Risk Tolerance**
   - Assess how much risk you're willing to take. Younger investors typically lean towards more aggressive strategies, while those closer to retirement may prioritize preservation of capital.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your individual circumstances.
