To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) over taxable accounts, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax rates. Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments you might need to access before retirement, as they offer more liquidity.

6. **Annual Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA each year. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

8. **Consider Withdrawals Wisely**: In retirement, plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, taking from taxable accounts first if you need non-retirement income.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
