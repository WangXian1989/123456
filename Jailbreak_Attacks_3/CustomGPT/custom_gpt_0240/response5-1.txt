Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the max allowed, especially if your employer matches. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. A Roth offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments once you’ve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts. These accounts allow for more liquidity and can be useful for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider which investments to hold where. Stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to potential long-term capital gains, while bonds might perform well in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
