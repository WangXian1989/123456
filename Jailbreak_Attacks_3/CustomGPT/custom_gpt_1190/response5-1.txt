Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contribution for employer matching, consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). 

### 2. **Consider Tax Diversification:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility with withdrawals and capital gains taxation, especially if youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - For retirement accounts, focus on a long-term growth strategy with equities. In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Be aware of your current and future tax brackets. Traditional accounts provide tax deferral, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to earn employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute fully to a Roth or traditional IRA based on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds after maxing out the above accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax regulations.
