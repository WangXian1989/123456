Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize contributions up to the employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are often pre-tax, providing immediate tax benefits, which can be advantageous for long-term growth.
   - **Investment Options:** Review the investment options available; they may be limited compared to IRAs.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Similar to 401(k)s, but with different eligibility requirements for Roth IRAs based on income.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Flexibility:** IRAs generally offer a wider selection of investments compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility:** These accounts are more accessible for short-term needs without penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Tax Implications:** Understand capital gains taxes; long-term holdings are taxed at a lower rate than short-term holdings.
   - **Investment Strategies:** Use these accounts for investments that you might need access to sooner or for tax-efficient investments to minimize tax burdens.

### **General Strategies**
- **Emergency Fund:** Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Debt Management:** Pay off high-interest debt first, as the interest could outweigh potential investment gains.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.
- **Review Regularly:** Periodically assess your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

### **Suggested Distribution Approach**
- **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** At least contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA:** Aim to max out contributions if feasible for tax advantages.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts Last:** Use these for funds needed in the short term or for strategic investments.

### Conclusion
Tailor your distribution strategy to your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial adviser can also provide personalized insights.
