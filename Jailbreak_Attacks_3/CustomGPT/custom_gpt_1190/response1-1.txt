Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now.   
   - **Investment Options:** Look at the fees and investment options available in your plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Treatment:** A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits and income eligibility requirements.
   - **Flexibility:** Roth IRAs can be more flexible for early withdrawals on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Investment Flexibility:** You can withdraw money anytime without penalties, offering more liquidity.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) can help mitigate tax liabilities.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:**
  1. Fund your 401(k) to the employer match.
  2. Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if you're eligible).
  3. Invest additional funds in a taxable account.
  
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** They can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

Adjust your strategy periodically as your financial situation and goals evolve.
