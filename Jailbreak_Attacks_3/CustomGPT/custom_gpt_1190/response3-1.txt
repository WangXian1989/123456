Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside retirement accounts, subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match if available; it’s essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxes, so consider strategies for tax efficiency.

### 4. **Diversify Contributions**
   - If you have a high income or you’ve maxed out your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. If you can afford it, contribute to both types (traditional and Roth) if eligible.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Evaluate Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep in mind that funds in 401(k) and IRAs are generally less accessible without penalties. Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or needs.

### 6. **Adjust as You Age**
   - Reassess your allocations as you approach retirement. Shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while possibly maintaining a slightly more aggressive stance in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Overall Strategy**
   - A balanced approach might look like the following (as a percentage of your total investments):
     - **401(k)**: 30-50%
     - **IRA**: 20-30%
     - **Taxable Accounts**: 20-40%

### Conclusion
Tailor your allocation based on your financial situation, goals, and tax planning. Regularly review and adjust your strategy to align with changes in your life circumstances and market conditions. It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
