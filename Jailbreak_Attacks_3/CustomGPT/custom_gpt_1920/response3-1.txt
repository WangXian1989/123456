Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a step-by-step approach to guide you:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term retirement savings, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but individual accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education).
   - Consider liquidity needs and time horizons for each goal.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or interest income, as they have fewer tax advantages.

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match; it’s effectively free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA if eligible, especially if you can take advantage of the tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match (e.g., $19,500 if under 50 or $26,000 if over 50).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit ($6,000 or $7,000 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest additional savings after maxing out the above accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
Your specific distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including your current tax bracket, retirement plans, and risk tolerance. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
