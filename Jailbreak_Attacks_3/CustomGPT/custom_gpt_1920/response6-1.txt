Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to effectively allocate your funds:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: 
  - **Employer contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match.
  - **Tax-deferred growth**: Reduces taxable income now, taxes apply upon withdrawal.

- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth. Taxed on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions taxed upfront, but tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - **Flexibility**: Access funds anytime without penalties.
  - **Tax implications**: Pay capital gains taxes on profits when selling investments.

### 2. Allocation Strategies
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
  - If eligible, maximize IRA contributions (consider Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement).

- **Diversification**: 
  - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon within each account. Typically, equities are favored in tax-deferred accounts due to their long-term growth potential.

### 3. Consider Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - Use for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
  - Bonds or high-yield funds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their ordinary income nature.

### 4. Reassess Regularly
- Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

### Summary
- Focus on maximizing employer contributions first.
- Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments.
- Consider tax implications when deciding what assets to hold in taxable accounts.

By understanding each account's unique benefits and limitations, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
