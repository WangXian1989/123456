Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. In 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50). Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Marginal Tax Rate:**
   - If your current tax rate is lower than what you anticipate in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA.
   - If you expect a higher tax rate in retirement, consider funding a Roth IRA.

### 3. **Diversification in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 
   - Hold bonds and real estate investment trusts (REITs) in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes on interest income.

### 4. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Needs:**
   - Keep liquid savings for emergencies in taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account to avoid penalties and taxes associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Choose appropriate asset allocations in each account that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, more aggressive investments may be suitable in tax-advantaged accounts since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they still meet your goals and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and market performance.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 20-30% of income up to maximum contribution.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, if possible.
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your investments, minimize taxes, and work toward your financial goals effectively. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your situation.
