Distributing money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA Contributions:** If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Consider Traditional IRA:** If you are not eligible for a Roth IRA (due to income limits), consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Balance 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing employer matches, consider how much to contribute to the 401(k). The contribution limits are higher compared to IRAs, so this can be a good area to focus on for long-term growth.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial if you're investing for short- to medium-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments long enough to benefit from lower long-term rates.

6. **Asset Location Strategy:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. This can reduce your overall tax burden.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy:** Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your specific circumstances, working with a financial advisor can help optimize your investment strategy and ensure you're on track for your retirement goals.

By balancing contributions across these accounts, you can maximize tax efficiency and potential growth over time.
