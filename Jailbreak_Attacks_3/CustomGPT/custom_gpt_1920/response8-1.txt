Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Has lower contribution limits than a 401(k) but can be tax-deductible (traditional IRA) or tax-free in retirement (Roth IRA). Consider your current tax rate vs. expected retirement tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. These are more flexible for withdrawals, but taxes apply to dividends and interest in the year earned.

2. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account before maximizing retirement contributions.

3. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Prioritize pre-tax contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future, consider maximizing Roth IRA contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you might sell or need access to before retirement, as they offer more flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments to minimize risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Allocate by Goals:** Consider short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs, while 401(k) and IRA can focus on long-term growth.

7. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your portfolio's performance and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure about the best strategy, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distribute your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
