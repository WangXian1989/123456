Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, but may have limited investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, with Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes and offers no specific tax benefits.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRAs**: Consider maxing out Roth IRAs if eligible, as they allow for tax-free withdrawals.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with the 401(k) up to the match.
   - Add to an IRA, focusing on a Roth or traditional based on your income and tax bracket.
   - Use any remaining funds for additional 401(k) contributions, then consider taxable accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These should generally hold long-term investments since you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal (traditional) or not at all (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you may need access to before retirement or for holding investments with favorable capital gains treatment (like index funds).

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account type.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, a financial advisor can help craft a strategy considering your overall financial picture.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize to employer match.
- **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth first if you meet the income limits.
- **Taxable Account**: Use for any short-term goals or for additional savings once maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Your distribution should align with your long-term goals, taking advantage of tax benefits while providing flexibility with your investments. Aim to balance growth and liquidity based on your specific financial situation.
