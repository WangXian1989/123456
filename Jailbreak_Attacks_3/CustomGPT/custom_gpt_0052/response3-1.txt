Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have savings in a liquid account (like a high-yield savings account) before putting all your money into retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable investment accounts. This offers flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts. Hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider tax implications and your expected income to minimize taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your investments periodically to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance.
