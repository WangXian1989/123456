When considering how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
- **Retirement Goals**: Determine when you plan to retire and how much you need.
- **Tax Considerations**: Understand your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k)**: 
  - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match.
  - **Pre-tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income.

- **IRA**: 
  - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect higher taxes in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deferral.

- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - **Liquidity Needs**: Use these for short-term goals or emergencies, as they provide flexibility without penalties.
  - **Investment Types**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. Review Regularly
- **Annual Check**: Reassess your strategy annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Summary
- Start with your 401(k) for the employer match.
- Max out IRA contributions based on tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment opportunities. 

By carefully considering these aspects, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
