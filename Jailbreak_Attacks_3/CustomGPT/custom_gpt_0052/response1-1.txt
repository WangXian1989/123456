Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023) if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2023. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, considering tax implications. For example, place high-growth investments in Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate easily accessible emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changing goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
