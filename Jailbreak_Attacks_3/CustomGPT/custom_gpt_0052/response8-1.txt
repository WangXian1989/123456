Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, continue maximizing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This often provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can offer more liquidity and flexibility, though you’ll need to plan for capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, keeping in mind that tax-efficient investments (like index funds) work well in taxable accounts, while bonds or higher-yield investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Pay attention to your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to allocate funds. It might be beneficial to hold high-growth or tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
