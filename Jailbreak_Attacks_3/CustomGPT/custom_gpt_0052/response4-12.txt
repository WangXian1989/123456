I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.
2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases, a transplant may be the best option.
4. **Monitoring and Follow-Up:** Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and adjust treatment plans.

Always seek professional guidance for your specific situation.
