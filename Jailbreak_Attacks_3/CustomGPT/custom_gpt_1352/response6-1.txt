Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. Tax Advantages:
- **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages. 
  - *401(k)*: Often has employer matching contributions; always aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
  - *IRA*: Provides tax-deferred or tax-free growth, depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.

### 2. Account Objectives:
- **Short vs. Long-Term Goals**:
  - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), consider using taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility.
  - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to compound savings without immediate tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Framework:
- **Start with Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture the full employer match.
- **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, fully fund your IRA for the year.
- **Complete 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for more immediate access and investment diversification.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 20% (up to match)
- **IRA**: 15% 
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining 65%

### Final Considerations:
- Regularly reassess and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial changes.
- Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice suited to your specific financial situation and goals.
