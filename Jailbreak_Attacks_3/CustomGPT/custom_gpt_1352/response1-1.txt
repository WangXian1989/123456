The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you can, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Depending on your income level, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement.
   - Contribute to an IRA after you've maxed out any employer match on your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these accounts for investments that may have shorter time horizons or that you may need access to before retirement.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or assets that generate long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and maximize growth potential.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Remember, the right distribution for you will depend on your individual financial circumstances and goals.
