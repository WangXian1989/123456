Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth) since these accounts can provide tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Back to 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions until you reach the contribution limit (for 2023, this is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investing once you’ve maximized contributions to your retirement accounts. These accounts are suitable for investments with a shorter time horizon or for those that may need access to funds sooner.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified to mitigate risk. Consider your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation (stocks vs. bonds, domestic vs. international, etc.).

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing from these accounts in the future. Generally, 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free after certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts may have capital gains taxes to consider.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically reassess and rebalance your investment allocations based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and career situation.

A personalized approach considering your unique financial situation and future plans can provide the best outcome, so consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial.
