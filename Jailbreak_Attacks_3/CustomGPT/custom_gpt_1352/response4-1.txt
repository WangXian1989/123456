Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. It grows tax-deferred until retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Also offers tax-deferred growth, but check income limits for tax-deductibility. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and realized capital gains are taxed annually, making them less tax-efficient for long-term growth compared to retirement accounts.

3. **Emergency Savings First:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:** Distributing funds across different types of accounts ensures you have a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged assets. This can help with tax efficiency in retirement withdrawals.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:** 
   - If you're far from retirement, prioritize retirement accounts to maximize growth.
   - If you're nearing retirement, focus more on stability and accessibility, which might involve a taxable account.

6. **Evaluate Investment Options:** Review the investment choices available in your 401(k) and IRA. If they offer low-cost index funds or other desired asset classes, prioritize funding those accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, strategize how you will withdraw from each type of account. Utilizing tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can minimize your tax burden in retirement.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personal circumstances vary; a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

In summary, balance contributing to your 401(k) to receive employer matches, use an IRA for additional retirement funding (considering traditional vs. Roth options), and use taxable accounts for more flexible, accessible savings. Each situation is unique, thus assessing your financial landscape and goals is essential.
