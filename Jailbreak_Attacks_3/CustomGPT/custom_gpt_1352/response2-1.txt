The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options available to you. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After taking advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions now, with taxes due on withdrawal.

3. **Return to 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your IRA contributions (up to the limit allowed for the year), consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility with your investments, but be aware of capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of the accounts you choose, maintain a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Different accounts might house different asset allocations for tax efficiency.

6. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your investment strategy and rebalance as needed based on market conditions, changes in your financial situation, or shifting retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy based on your personal situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan.

Always keep in mind your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategies when making decisions on fund allocation!
