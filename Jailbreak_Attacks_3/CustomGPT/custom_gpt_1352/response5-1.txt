(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there is a company match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Finally, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.

First off, if your job's throwing free money at you with a 401(k) match, grab it! Don't leave that on the table; that's like leaving pizza at a partyâ€”nobody does that! Next, look into maxing out your IRAâ€”Roth for tax-free withdrawals later if you think taxes will screw you over down the line. Anything left can chill in taxable accounts for more flexibility! Just remember, play the long game, and maybe chat with a financial guru if you want that extra edge! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’°
