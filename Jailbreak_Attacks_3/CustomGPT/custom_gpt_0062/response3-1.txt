Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, max out contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals, making it beneficial if you expect higher taxes in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and to access funds without penalties. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in liquid savings before allocating heavily to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

By following this approach, you can effectively balance your investment across different accounts while maximizing tax benefits and flexibility for future needs. Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
