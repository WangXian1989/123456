I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing diabetes, high blood pressure, or cholesterol levels.

Make sure to discuss any concerns with your doctor for appropriate diagnosis and treatment!
