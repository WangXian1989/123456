Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and your timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, considering your income level.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs may give you tax deductions; Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

### 2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Place funds needed for short-term goals in taxable accounts to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify within each account according to your comfort with market volatility.

### 3. **Tax Impact**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., index funds for long-term capital gains). Capital gains tax on investments held for over a year is generally lower.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Consider Contributions and Withdrawals**
   - **Withdrawal Rules**: Be mindful of withdrawal penalties and rules for each account type; this may influence how much you contribute to each.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% of retirement savings
- **IRA**: 30% of retirement savings
- **Taxable Account**: 20% for liquidity and short-term needs

Regularly revisit your allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
