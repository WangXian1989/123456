The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some factors to consider:

### 1. **Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, so aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** You can choose between traditional IRAs (pre-tax contributions) and Roth IRAs (post-tax contributions). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. Investment earnings will be taxed each year if realized.

### 2. **Investment Objectives:**
   - Consider your retirement timeline. If you're far from retirement, you might allocate more to stock-heavy investments for growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, keep those funds in taxable accounts for easier access, even if it means less tax efficiency.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk, regardless of the account type.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first if possible.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw funds. This might affect how much you contribute to each account type based on your expected tax situation upon retirement.

### Example Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to get the employer match.
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** if eligible, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for flexibility, especially for short-term goals or when you reach the contribution limits of the other accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically review your asset allocation and performance to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
