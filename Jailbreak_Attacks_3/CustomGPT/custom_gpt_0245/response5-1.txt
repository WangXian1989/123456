Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). If possible, max out your contributions for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends due to favorable tax rates. Use these for more flexible, short-term goals.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Aim for a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals by reviewing and adjusting periodically.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a cash reserve in a high-yield savings account separate from your investments.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match.
2. Max out a Roth IRA if eligible.
3. Invest remaining funds in a taxable account, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Summary:
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income, diversify across all investment vehicles, and reassess your strategy regularly.
