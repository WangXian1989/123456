Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Tax Treatment:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions; taxes paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth upon qualifying withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains tax when investments are sold.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Goals:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Ensure youâ€™re maximizing employer matching contributions in your 401(k).
   - Adhere to IRA contribution limits based on IRS regulations.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider when you plan to access these funds. Early withdrawals from retirement accounts might incur penalties.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Use a mix of investments in each account type to balance risk.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, maximize your IRA contributions for tax-advantaged growth.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out the IRA, return to add more to the 401(k).
4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use for excess savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

### Final Tips:
- Review your investments regularly to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax benefits while preparing for future financial needs.
