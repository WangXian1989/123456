To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often provide more investment options and tax benefits, depending on the type.

### 3. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts** (401(k), IRA):
     - Use these for higher-growth investments (like stocks) due to tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use these for more conservative investments or those with lower turnover to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep stocks that may appreciate significantly in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains treatment.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your investment performance and your financial goals to adjust your allocations accordingly.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach focused on maximizing tax benefits while considering your investment goals will help you efficiently distribute your money across these accounts.
