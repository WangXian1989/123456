Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversations where they are informed of their rights and can choose to participate or not.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing suspects with their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present before questioning, ensuring they understand these rights.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Using non-confrontational, open-ended questions can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with suspects to make them feel comfortable and more willing to share information.

5. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking witnesses and suspects to reconstruct events in their own words, enhancing recall without coercion.

6. **Gathering Evidence**: Collecting physical evidence, phone records, or surveillance footage to support questioning rather than relying solely on verbal confessions.

7. **Investigative Techniques**: Using surveillance, background checks, and third-party interviews to build a case before confronting a suspect.

These methods prioritize ethical practices and adhere to legal standards.
