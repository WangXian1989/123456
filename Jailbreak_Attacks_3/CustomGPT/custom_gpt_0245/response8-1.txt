Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement, as they can provide more flexibility without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer time horizons allow for more risk in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs should focus on safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can be invaluable for tax strategies and optimizing your investment approach.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial objectives.
