To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for at least 6-10% of your salary if your employer matches.

### 2. **Tax Advantages**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA), as they reduce your taxable income now and allow for tax-free growth until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). This allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding a taxable account. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for emergencies or short-term goals.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across accounts. Stocks can be kept in tax-deferred accounts, where growth is tax-free, and bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax on interest income.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Ultimately, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Max out until match limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute to Roth or traditional based on tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Balance growth potential with liquidity needs, and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes.
