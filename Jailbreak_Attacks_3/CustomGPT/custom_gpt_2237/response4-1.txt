The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income and expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize contributions here. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth. Maximize contributions to the account that offers the best tax benefits for your situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate little taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, which can help manage capital gains.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Make sure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts or cash savings for unexpected expenses.

6. **Consider Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to balance risk and income generation.

7. **Regular Review**:
   - Frequently review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

Itâ€™s often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
