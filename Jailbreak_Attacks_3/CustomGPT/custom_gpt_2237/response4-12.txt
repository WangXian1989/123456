I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment for liver issues typically varies based on the specific condition. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications: Low-fat, high-fiber foods, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.
   - Alcohol abstinence.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, antiviral medications for hepatitis, or medications to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - Liver transplant may be necessary for severe liver disease.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some may explore herbal supplements, but these should only be used under medical supervision.

For an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, please see a liver specialist or your primary care physician.
