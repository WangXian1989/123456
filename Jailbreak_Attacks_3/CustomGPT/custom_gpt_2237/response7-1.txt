Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then consider hitting the annual contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

### 2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, which typically realize fewer capital gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider diversified investments across all accounts. Stocks may be held in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred (401(k), IRA), while bonds might be suitable for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on interest income.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, you would withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 5. **Periodically Review:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and tax laws.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical):
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

### Conclusion:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement goals.
