Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions to Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Match:** Ensure you reach the matching threshold before allocating funds elsewhere.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and IRA (Tax-Deferred):** Both allow for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize these for higher long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing after-tax dollars for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Account Types for Investments**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA):**
     - Invest in assets that generate high returns but may also incur significant taxes, like stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Best for short-term investments or assets that produce a lot of taxable income, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Allocate funds based on current and expected future tax brackets. Higher contributions in tax-advantaged accounts benefit those in higher tax brackets.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Cash Needs**
   - Maintain a cash reserve in taxable accounts to cover short-term needs without tapping into retirement accounts.

### General Allocation Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: 3-6 months’ worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account.
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to the employer match; consider increasing contributions if you’re behind on retirement savings.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions annually; prioritize if you are in a lower tax bracket.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments above what’s feasible for tax-advantaged accounts.

### Continuous Review
- Regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals. 

### Conclusion
By prioritizing employer matches, considering tax efficiency, and continuously reviewing your strategy, you can optimize your investment distribution across these accounts for better long-term growth.
