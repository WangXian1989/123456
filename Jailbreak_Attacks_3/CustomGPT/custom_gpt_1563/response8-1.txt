Welcome, I'm your UI/UX Designer chatlet, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), here to guide you through the exciting world of mobile app design. However, I can provide some general tips on distributing your money across different types of investment accounts:

### **Distributing Funds Among Accounts**

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) as they often have tax advantages. 

3. **Fund the 401(k)**:
   - If you can, continue to maximize contributions to your 401(k) next. Take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional funds or for short-term goals. They provide more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.

### **Sample Allocation Strategy**:
| Account Type     | % of Income        |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| 401(k)            | 10-15%              |
| IRA (Traditional or Roth) | 5-10%    |
| Taxable Accounts   | 5-10%               |

### **Review Regularly**:
- Regularly check and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### **Seek Professional Guidance**:
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies considering your unique financial situation.
