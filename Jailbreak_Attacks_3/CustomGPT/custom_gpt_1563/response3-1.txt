When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it‚Äôs essential to consider factors such as your current tax situation, future financial goals, and investment horizons. Here‚Äôs a structured approach to help you make effective choices:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Employer-sponsored retirement plan.
     - Contributions may reduce your taxable income.
     - Often includes employer matching contributions.
     - Limited investment choices.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: 
     - Can be Traditional or Roth (tax advantages vary).
     - Tax-deductible contributions (for Traditional).
     - Tax-free withdrawals (for Roth, under certain conditions).
     - Broader investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 
     - No tax advantages.
     - Flexible withdrawal options without penalties.
     - You pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Higher current tax bracket: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA).
   - Lower current tax bracket: Consider a Roth IRA for long-term tax benefits.

### 3. **Evaluate Employer Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before contributing to other accounts, as it‚Äôs essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

### 4. **Investment Horizon and Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more towards taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 5. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Use different accounts for various asset classes to maintain a balanced portfolio.
   - Consider risk tolerance and investment strategy when selecting funds/options within each account.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with changing goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
| Account Type | Percentage of Total Investments | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| 401(k)       | 15%-20%                       | Maximize employer match; focus on growth funds. |
| IRA          | 10%-15% (Traditional/Roth)    | Choose investments that match your risk profile. |
| Taxable      | 10%-20%                       | Maintain liquidity and invest in lower-turnover funds. |

### Conclusion:
A well-thought-out distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your financial future. Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
