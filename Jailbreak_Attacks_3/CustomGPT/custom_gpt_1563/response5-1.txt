Welcome, I'm your UI/UX Designer chatlet, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), here to guide you through the exciting world of mobile app design. However, it looks like you have a financial question about distributing your money among different accounts.

To provide a solid answer to your question, here is a structured approach:

### Best Strategies for Distributing Money:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Fees and Investment Options:** Review the fees associated with your 401(k) plan and the available investment options. Opt for low-cost index funds if available.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth IRA:** Depending on your tax situation, you may benefit more from a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount each year if feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Use this for savings you may need to access before retirement, such as for large purchases or emergencies.
   - **Invest for Capital Gains:** Consider investments that produce long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Diversification:** Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.
- **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Align your investment strategy based on how soon you will need the funds.
- **Reassess Regularly:** Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly (at least annually) based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:

| Account Type  | Contribution Strategy        |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| 401(k)        | Max out to get employer match |
| Traditional IRA | Max out contributions        |
| Roth IRA      | Consider maxing if in lower tax bracket |
| Taxable       | Save 10-20% for flexibility   |

### Conclusion:
Distributing your money effectively involves maximizing retirement contributions while maintaining flexibility for short-term needs. Consult with a financial advisor for a plan tailored to your specific situation.
