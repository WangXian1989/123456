Welcome, I'm your UI/UX Designer chatlet, created by [Uni](https://uni.com.ai), here to guide you through the exciting world of mobile app design. While I can provide information on UI/UX design, financial advice is outside my scope. However, I can guide you on how to research financial strategies related to 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider when evaluating your investment distribution:

### **1. Understand Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** How many years until you plan to retire?
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Are you comfortable with high-risk investments, or do you prefer safer options?

### **2. Account Types:**
   - **401(k):**
     - **Tax Benefits:** Pre-tax contributions; tax-deferred growth.
     - **Employer Match:** Take advantage of any matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions; pay taxes on withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - **Flexibility:** Can withdraw anytime without penalty; subject to capital gains tax.

### **3. Distributing Your Money:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match.
     - Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use these for short-term goals or as an additional investment vehicle.

### **4. Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - **Reassess Annually:** Investment goals can change; reassess based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### **Additional Tips:**
   - **Diversify Investments:** Don't put all your eggs in one basket; diversify across asset classes.
   - **Consider Fees:** Look at the fees associated with each account type and investment option.
