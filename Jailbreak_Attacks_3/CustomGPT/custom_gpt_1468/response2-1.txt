When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to help you strategize:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth), as these accounts offer tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).

3. **Balance Between Accounts**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, you can then direct additional savings to a taxable account. Keep in mind the tax implications of investments in taxable accounts, such as capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your investment strategy, consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (where gains will be taxed less) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts (to minimize tax exposure).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a cash buffer or emergency fund in an easily accessible account before heavily investing elsewhere.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and investment performance regularly to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about what distribution strategy works best for you, consider consulting with a financial planner for tailored advice.

Choosing the right distribution strategy involves carefully considering your individual financial situation and goals. Itâ€™s always a good idea to stay informed about the current contribution limits and tax implications.
