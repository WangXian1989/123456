Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a simple framework to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as they often have tax advantages.
   
2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA.
   - If you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might consider Roth IRA contributions if eligible.

3. **Balanced Investment Approach:**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for more liquid investments or those that may generate capital gains.

4. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals:**
   - Keep for retirement in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for goals within 5 years (home purchase, travel).

Ultimately, it would be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation, as they can provide individualized advice taking into account your unique financial landscape.
