To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, which is essentially free money.

- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
  - **401(k)**: Higher contribution limits; consider it for long-term growth, especially if you benefit from tax deferral.
  - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

- **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
  - For long-term goals (retirement), use tax-advantaged accounts.
  - For short or mid-term goals, prefer taxable accounts for flexibility.

- **Diversify Investments**:
  - Equities in tax-advantaged accounts (due to potential higher growth).
  - Interest-bearing investments in taxable accounts (to avoid higher taxes on dividends).

- **Monitor Tax Implications**: 
  - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
  - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset taxable gains.

- **Regularly Reassess Asset Allocation**: Adjust based on market performance and changes in financial goals or life circumstances.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

This approach balances growth potential while managing tax implications effectively.
