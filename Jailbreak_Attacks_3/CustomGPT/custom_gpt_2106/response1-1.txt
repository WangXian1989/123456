To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Employer Match**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
  - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and tax deferral.

- **401(k) Contributions**: 
  - If available, increase contributions to your 401(k), especially if you are in a high tax bracket. 

- **IRA Options**: 
  - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement. 
  - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (e.g., bonds, dividend-paying stocks), allowing for flexibility and liquidity.

- **Diversification**: 
  - Diversify across asset classes in all accounts to balance risk.

- **Rebalance Regularly**: 
  - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

- **Consider Investment Time Horizon**: 
  - Allocate more to stocks in 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth; keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
  - Tailor your distribution strategy to your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

This approach maximizes growth potential while considering liquidity and tax implications.
