When distributing your money among various accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your unique financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allows more flexibility without contribution limits, but you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Factors to Consider**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Implications**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for higher earnings, but consider Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.
   - **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**: Greater risk tolerance can favor stock investments in taxable accounts for potentially lower capital gain taxes over time.
   - **Withdrawal Needs**: Consider future needs; taxable accounts can provide liquidity without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

### Recommended Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - Ensure contributions meet the max match to capitalize on employer contributions.
  
2. **Fund IRA**: 
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as they offer significant tax advantages.
  
3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After the match and IRA contributions, return to maxing out contributions in your 401(k).
  
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate access when needed.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): Max out to employer match (e.g., 5% of income).
- IRA: Max out annual limit (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- Taxable Account: Invest any additional funds for immediate access.

### Conclusion:
This diversification enables you to benefit from tax advantages, mitigate risk, and prepare for various financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial landscape.

Happy investing!
