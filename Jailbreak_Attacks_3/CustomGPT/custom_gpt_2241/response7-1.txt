Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize funding this if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (e.g., 401(k), Traditional IRA): Contribute to these accounts first to lower taxable income, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for flexible withdrawals without penalties. Consider this for funds needed before retirement or for emergencies.

3. **Investment Horizons**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, where compounding can reduce tax impacts.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, as they allow more access without early withdrawal penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments like stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) which may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and your personal financial goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
