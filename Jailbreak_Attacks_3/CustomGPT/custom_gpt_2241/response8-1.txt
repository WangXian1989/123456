To optimize your investment distribution across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fully fund a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place income-generating assets (e.g., bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to defer taxes on interest.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Balance your investment types across all accounts to minimize risk. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in one asset class.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation in each account based on performance, contributions, and changing goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes—consider using funds from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a well-rounded and tax-efficient investment strategy.
