Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Ideal for those in a higher tax bracket now compared to retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, choose the type of IRA:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Pre-tax contributions, taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: After-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Good for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can afford it, maximize your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match. 

4. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you're able to, keep contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit, especially if your employer matches.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments beyond retirement accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liability.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, life events, or market performance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

### Summary:
- Prioritize 401(k) for employer match.
- Max out IRA contributions next.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and additional savings. 

Adjust contributions as needed based on your financial goals and changes in your situation.
