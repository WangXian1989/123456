Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax outlook). This can provide tax advantages and compound growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) to take advantage of higher contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, use taxable accounts for investments that are more liquid and can be withdrawn without penalties, giving you flexibility.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. Generally, it's best to hold investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.
