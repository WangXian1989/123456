To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts often provide tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, traditional accounts can lower your taxable income now.

### 2. **Account Purpose**
   - **Long-Term Growth (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, within these accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs (Taxable Accounts)**: Keep more liquid investments or emergency funds in taxable accounts, as they allow easier access without penalties.

### 3. **Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks may be appropriate for long-term accounts, while bonds or cash equivalents might suit shorter-term needs.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with your financial goals.

### Key Steps:
- Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored plans, especially if they offer a match.
- Utilize IRAs for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- Keep an emergency fund and short-term savings in taxable accounts for quick access. 

By balancing current tax benefits with long-term growth potential, you'll optimize your overall investment strategy.
