The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. If you're currently in a high tax bracket, these accounts can provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for short-term and medium-term goals or for funds you need access to before retirement. They can also be useful for tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) in all accounts to maintain a diversified portfolio. Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across different accounts, considering changes in market conditions or your financial situation.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep a separate emergency fund in a liquid savings account. This should cover 3-6 months of expenses, so you donâ€™t have to dip into your retirement accounts prematurely.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary, up to max with employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500/year).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, tailor your approach based on your specific circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help you create a personalized plan that considers your overall financial picture.
