The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you're in a lower tax bracket now compared to retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or if you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to manage risk.

4. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation**:
   - As your financial situation changes, so should your allocation strategy. Regularly review your investments and adjust as necessary to align with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation and goals.
