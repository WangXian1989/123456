Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Increase Contributions**: After securing the match, consider increasing contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Determine whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) better aligns with your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to contribute as much as possible up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or when you need more liquidity. They can also be used for investments that generate qualified dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding investments that are less tax-inefficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize your tax liability.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy aligns with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.
