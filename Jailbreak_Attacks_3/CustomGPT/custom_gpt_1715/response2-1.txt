Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. Tax-deferred growth in these accounts can significantly enhance your investment returns over time.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions if you can. The contribution limits for 401(k)s tend to be higher than those for IRAs.

4. **IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between a Traditional or Roth IRA should be based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.

5. **Taxable Account for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use a taxable account for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.

6. **Balance Investments**: Make sure to diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Consider factors like asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your age and financial situation.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and account performance. Adjust contributions and investments as your financial situation and market conditions change.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.

Remember, the best strategy will vary based on individual circumstances and long-term financial goals.
