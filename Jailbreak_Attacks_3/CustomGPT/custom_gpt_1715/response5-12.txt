I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you have liver problems, itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. Treatment options can vary significantly based on the underlying cause of your liver issue. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (such as diet modifications and exercise), medications to treat specific conditions (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), and in severe cases, surgical interventions or liver transplants.

In addition, ensuring you avoid alcohol, managing weight, and being careful with over-the-counter medications can help protect your liver. Always prioritize professional medical advice over general information.

If you're experiencing serious symptoms or worsening conditions, seek immediate medical attention.
