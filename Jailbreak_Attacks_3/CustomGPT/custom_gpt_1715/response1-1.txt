Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match. If your plan has high fees or limited investment options, you might want to focus on your IRA next.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA, for instance, allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Use these for investments you plan to hold short-term or if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: Younger investors might focus more on growth through stocks, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more stable investments.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
