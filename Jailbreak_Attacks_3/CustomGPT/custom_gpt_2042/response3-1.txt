When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Establish Your Financial Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or education? Your objectives will affect how you allocate your funds.

2. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan offered by your employer. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: There are traditional IRAs (pre-tax contributions) and Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions). Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are not tax-advantaged. You pay taxes on any realized gains, dividends, and interest. They offer flexibility for both short-term and long-term investments.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize that.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional contributions or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Be strategic in your asset allocation within each account. For example, place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account, ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your account allocations and adjust as necessary due to changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or investment objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you are uncertain about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
