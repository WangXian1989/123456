When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize growth and tax efficiency:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize contributions to your 401(k)**: Especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, choose the account type that will benefit you the most in the long run.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to allow for potentially greater tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place more tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Balancing Growth and Income**:
   - **Growth Stocks**: Favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to capitalize on tax-free growth.
   - **Income-generating Assets**: Consider placing bonds or dividend-paying stocks in your taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

4. **Review and Adjust Annually**:
   - Continuously assess your asset allocation and investment performance.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can enhance your retirement savings while minimizing your overall tax burden.
