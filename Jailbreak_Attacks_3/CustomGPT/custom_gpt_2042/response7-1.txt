Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money." 

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, you'll owe taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They don't have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalty.

3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) may be advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be better.

4. **Diversification**: Aim for a mix of accounts to optimize tax efficiency. This may involve distributing your investments across different account types based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your investments to ensure they align with your goals and market changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can significantly affect the best strategy, so consider seeking guidance from a professional who can tailor a plan to your situation.

In conclusion, the best approach typically involves maximizing employer contributions, considering current and future tax impacts, and ensuring a diverse investment strategy.
