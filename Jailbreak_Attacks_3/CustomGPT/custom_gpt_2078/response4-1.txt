When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. 

1. **Tax Considerations**: 401(k) and IRA accounts offer tax advantages. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts do not provide immediate tax benefits, but they offer flexibility.

2. **Investment Goals**: Assess your short-term and long-term financial objectives. If you aim for retirement, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA may be beneficial. For shorter-term goals, consider allocating more funds to taxable accounts, which provide liquidity.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the maximum contribution for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 or older). Ensure you are maximizing contributions and consider employer matching in your 401(k).

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified. Depending on your risk tolerance, you may opt for a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you intend to withdraw from these accounts. Consider nurturing your tax-advantaged accounts for as long as possible to maximize growth, while keeping in mind the tax implications and potential penalties associated with early withdrawals.

Ultimately, it is advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances and retirement plan.
