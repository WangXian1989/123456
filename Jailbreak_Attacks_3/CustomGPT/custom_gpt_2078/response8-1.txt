When considering the optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to take several factors into account, including your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. 

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) often come with tax advantages. If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize maximizing that benefit, as it is essentially free money. The general recommendation is to contribute enough to meet the employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Depending on the type of IRA (Traditional or Roth), the tax implications differ. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding how to allocate funds. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA might be advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments. However, they might incur capital gains tax on earnings. If you have already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, any additional funds can be directed to a taxable account. It is beneficial to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in these accounts due to lower tax rates.

**Strategy Overview**:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions to secure the employer match.
- Next, consider your IRA contributions based on your long-term tax strategy and retirement plans.
- Finally, allocate additional savings to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.
