To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, so this account is beneficial for higher-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that may be accessed before retirement without penalties. They are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

3. **Investment Options**: Diversify your investments within each account type. Generally, higher-risk assets may be more suitable for long-term accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA), while more liquid investments might be better in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Location**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your distribution based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Younger individuals may want to lean more heavily into growth investments.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
