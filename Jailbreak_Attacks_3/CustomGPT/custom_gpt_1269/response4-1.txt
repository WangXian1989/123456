To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off high-interest debts before investing heavily, as this can improve your financial health.

3. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contributions reduce your taxable income. Look for lower fees and good investment options.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, choose a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for investments that donâ€™t fit in tax-advantaged accounts, such as short-term savings or specific investment strategies. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on risk tolerance and age.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary to align with your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual situation.
