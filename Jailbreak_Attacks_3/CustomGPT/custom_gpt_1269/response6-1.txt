The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing this contribution if you have limited funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers a tax deduction now.

### 2. **Emergency Fund & Taxable Accounts**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves (3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before allocating excess funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds before retirement.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold stocks in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts to take advantage of potential tax benefits (like tax-free municipal bonds) while keeping your tax-advantaged accounts focused on higher growth potential assets.

### 4. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change. Adjust contributions based on performance and tax implications.

### Conclusion
A balanced strategy that maximizes tax-advantaged accounts, maintains an emergency fund, and considers your specific financial goals will help you effectively distribute your funds for optimal growth and accessibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your individual needs.
