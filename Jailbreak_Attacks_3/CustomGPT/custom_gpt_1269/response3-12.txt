It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding excess sugars and fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Avoid or limit alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Treat conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or hepatitis as necessary to prevent further liver damage.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures to remove blockages or, in very serious cases, liver transplantation may be considered.

Always discuss any treatment plan with your doctor to ensure it's safe and appropriate for your specific condition.
