I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition and its severity. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat specific issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track the disease's progress.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can support liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
