Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefitâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for more flexibility. These can be beneficial if you need funds before retirement or want to invest in assets that may generate favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks might be better in retirement accounts (due to their growth potential) and bonds in taxable accounts (to manage tax implications).

5. **Tax Management**: Be mindful of tax efficiency; for instance, hold investments with high tax burdens (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and let high-growth investments flourish in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations regularly based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations tailored to your unique circumstances.
