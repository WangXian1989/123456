When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These are beneficial for long-term growth since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold lower-growth, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax exposure.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on your tax bracket to minimize tax implications during retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and ensure alignment with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, goals, and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you can maximize your returns while minimizing tax liabilities.
