To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high income, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to the limit to benefit from tax deferrals.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. If eligible, aim to max this out as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and timeline:
   - Place higher-risk investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor a plan specific to your situation, especially if youâ€™re unsure about the best strategy for tax implications.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
