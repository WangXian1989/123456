Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions may be pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for immediate access to funds or if you anticipate needing money sooner.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks may be weighted more heavily in accounts for long-term growth, while bonds might be prioritized in accounts for shorter-term needs.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax Location Strategy**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
- Max out your IRA contributions next.
- Use any remaining funds for your taxable account to achieve a balanced and diversified portfolio.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can tailor advice to your specific situation and goals.
