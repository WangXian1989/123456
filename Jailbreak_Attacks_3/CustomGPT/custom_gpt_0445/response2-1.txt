Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **If available**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which can reduce your taxable income now. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax advantages as a 401(k) for contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While not tax-advantaged, you can withdraw funds freely, and long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Retirement Goals**: For long-term goals like retirement, prioritize 401(k) and IRAs to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Short- to Medium-Term Goals**: For goals within the next 5-10 years, consider keeping more funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and market exposure preferences.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Income**
   - If you're in a high-income bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you're in a lower bracket, consider Roth options to lock in a lower tax rate on your contributions.

### Example Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k) to employer match**.
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** (if eligible), taking advantage of tax-free growth.
3. **Any additional savings** can go into your 401(k) until the annual limit is reached, then into a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### Re-evaluate Regularly
Review your strategy annually or when significant life changes occur, such as a raise, job change, or changing retirement goals.
