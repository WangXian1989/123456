To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax benefits, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep liquid funds in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k) with options for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains tax applies upon selling investments; consider holding onto investments long-term to reduce this.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on risk tolerance. 
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

### Conclusion
By strategically distributing your funds based on these guidelines, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
