Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeframe for each investment. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts can help your investments grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of a Roth).

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, for instance, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Funds in a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed upon withdrawal. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth accounts, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs or if you want more liquidity. These accounts allow for easy access to your money but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts. For example, hold more conservative investments in tax-deferred accounts and more aggressive investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates over time.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, changes in income, or changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
