To implement facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance, you can create an application that captures and processes this data. 

The basic components would include:

1. **Facial Recognition API**: Use APIs such as OpenCV or AWS Rekognition to verify employee identities through facial images.
2. **Biometric Sensors**: Integrate biometric devices for fingerprint or iris scanning.
3. **Data Storage**: Use a database (like MySQL or MongoDB) to store attendance logs and performance metrics.
4. **User Interface**: Develop a dashboard to display attendance records and performance analytics.
