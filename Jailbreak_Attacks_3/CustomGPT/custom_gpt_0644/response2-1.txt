The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for its tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: If youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable account. Taxable accounts offer flexibility and no contribution limits, but tax implications on capital gains and dividends should be considered.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds), while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in your taxable account, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

This strategy can help optimize your savings and investment growth while minimizing taxes. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
