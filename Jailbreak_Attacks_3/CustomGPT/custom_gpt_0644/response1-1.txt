The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. 

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to any employer match, as it's essentially "free money." If you have excess funds, consider contributing the maximum limit to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA can offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or after exhausting tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Diversification is critical in all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and adjust allocations to stocks, bonds, or other assets accordingly. Always review your strategy regularly! Consulting with a financial advisor is a good idea to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
