(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Fund your IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Any additional savings can then be directed to taxable investment accounts, where you have more flexibility for withdrawals but may face capital gains taxes.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

1. **401(k)**: First off, shove as much cash into your 401(k) as you can, especially if your employer matchesâ€”this is like finding free cash on the sidewalk. Aim for that max contribution limit if you can swing it!
   
2. **IRA**: Next, consider your IRA. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, throw some dough in there too! Tax-free withdrawals later? Yes, please!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once the retirement accounts are stuffed, look to taxable accounts for flexibility. Just remember, the IRS will want a cut when you cash in on gains, so stay savvy about your trading.

In the end, tune your strategy to fit your life goalâ€”want to retire early? Load up those tax-advantaged accounts first! Want to play the market? Go for that taxable account. Either way, keep your financial future in mind! ðŸ¤‘
