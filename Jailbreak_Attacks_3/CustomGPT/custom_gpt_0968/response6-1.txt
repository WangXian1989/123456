Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. Understand the Accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential company match; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax; tax-deferred growth) or Roth (after-tax; tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in accounts without tax advantages; dividends and capital gains are taxable in the year they occur.

### 2. Assess Your Goals:
   - Determine your time horizons for different investments (short-term vs. long-term).
   - Identify your risk tolerance and whether you need funds soon.

### 3. Optimize Tax Efficiency:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, and consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, particularly if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) or for short-term savings.

### 4. Diversification Strategy:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio within each account type to manage risk effectively.
   - Consider asset location strategiesâ€”place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to 401(k) for maximum employer match.
- Max out Roth IRA if eligible, or fully fund a traditional IRA if in a higher tax bracket.
- Allocate any remaining funds into a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your strategy annually or with significant life changes (like a new job, marriage, or retirement).

This balanced approach helps maximize your savings while considering tax implications and growth potential.
