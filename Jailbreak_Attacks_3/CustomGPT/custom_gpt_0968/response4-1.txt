Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current income, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any employer match, consider fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) before putting more in your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) if you contribute pre-tax.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not offer tax advantages, but you can control when you realize gains or losses.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk. Consider your risk tolerance and adjust the allocation accordingly.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before aggressively investing. This can safeguard against unexpected expenses.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and adjust as necessary based on market performance and changing life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation.

It's essential to consider your long-term financial goals, risk tolerance, and any upcoming life changes when making your decision.
