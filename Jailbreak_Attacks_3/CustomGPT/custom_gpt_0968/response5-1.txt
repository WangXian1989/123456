(üîíNormal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially ‚Äúfree money.‚Äù

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in savings for emergencies before investing aggressively.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions next, as these offer tax advantages that can significantly improve your long-term savings.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals and fewer penalties but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure proper diversification of your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your unique situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, throw enough into your 401(k) to grab that free cash‚Äîit‚Äôs basically like winning the workplace lottery.

2. **Tackle the IRA**: Next up, consider a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional is great for deferring taxes, while Roth lets you cash out tax-free later on. Go for the max contribution if you can swing it!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've hit the limits on tax-advantaged accounts, throw some dough into taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax breaks, but they‚Äôre super flexible for when you want to access your funds without penalties.

4. **Balance and Diversify**: Make sure your investments are spread out‚Äîdon‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket! Look at risk tolerance and long-term goals for guidance.

Always wise to tweak this strategy with a financial pro who knows your personal situation, though! Keep your money working while you chill!
