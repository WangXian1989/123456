To efficiently distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax benefits. Contributing to your 401(k) can reduce your taxable income, and IRAs can offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals depending on whether theyâ€™re traditional or Roth.

2. **Consider Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Understand your current tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) might be wise, as they offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement age, such as short-term savings goals or for emergencies.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA), and last from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
