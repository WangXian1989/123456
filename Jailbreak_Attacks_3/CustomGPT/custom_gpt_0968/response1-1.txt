Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Check the annual contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older) across all IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider using these accounts for investments that might generate higher taxable income or for shorter-term goals.

### Balancing Your Contributions:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before making significant investments.
- **Debt Management**: Prioritize paying down high-interest debt.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes in all accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Long-Term Strategy**: Tailor your contributions based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

### Adjust Over Time:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
