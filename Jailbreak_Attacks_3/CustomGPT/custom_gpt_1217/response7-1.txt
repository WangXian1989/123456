Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines for allocating your assets across these accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your income allows (up to the annual limit) since contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers potential tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals.
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, and a Traditional IRA if you think your tax rate will be lower.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for flexible withdrawal options.
   - Be mindful of tax implications when investing in a taxable account. Focus on tax-efficient investing (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance and Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments within each account to spread risk. Consider your overall asset allocation strategy across all accounts.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, especially as tax laws and financial circumstances can change.

Always keep an eye on your long-term financial goals and adjust your strategy as needed.
