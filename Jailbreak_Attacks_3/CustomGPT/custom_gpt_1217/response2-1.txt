When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which means you won’t pay taxes on this money until you withdraw it in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider investing in a Roth IRA. Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them, so consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Keep a diverse portfolio across all accounts. This can involve different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment styles (growth, value, etc.) to help reduce risk.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - If you have a longer timeline until retirement, you might allocate more to equities for higher potential returns.
   - If you expect to need the money sooner, prioritize more stable, less volatile investments.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your goals and market performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial situations can be complex, and a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.

Always remember that it’s essential to have a clear understanding of your individual financial goals and risk tolerance when making investment decisions.
