The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you with the allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Evaluate Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k). Consider this if you're looking for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Generally, it’s wise to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow without immediate tax implications.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure that you're diversifying your investment selections based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.).

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you plan to withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Ideally, you might want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Reassess and Adjust Periodically**: Financial situations change, so it’s important to reassess your contributions and investment distributions periodically based on performance and any changes in your personal situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that takes into account your entire financial picture, speak with a professional financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, tailored to your individual circumstances.
