When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, keep the following principles in mind:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, with taxes owed on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with income limits for tax-deductible contributions. Withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These do not have tax advantages but allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Capital gains and dividends are taxed, but you can control when you realize those gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Determine your short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (10+ years) financial goals. For longer-term goals, focus on tax-advantaged accounts first.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 4. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **Max out contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for a 401(k) for those under age 50, and $6,500 for both traditional and Roth IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).
   
### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment time frame. Consider using low-cost index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place investments that generate high taxes in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., bonds in IRAs) and consider holding stocks with lower turnover in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 7. **Reevaluate Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution and contributions, especially after significant life changes (job changes, marriage, etc.) or market fluctuations.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out 401(k) contributions** to the limit, especially to secure employer matching.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth), depending on eligibility and tax strategy.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** as needed for goals outside of retirement (like buying a home).

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution largely depends on personal circumstances, tax situation, and market conditions, so adjusting your strategy as necessary is key. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific needs.
