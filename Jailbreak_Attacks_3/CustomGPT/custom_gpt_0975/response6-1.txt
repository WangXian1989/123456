When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for maximizing tax benefits, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**   
     - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal; may lower your taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Best if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains are subject to capital gains tax, but you can access your money anytime without penalties.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Retirement Goals:** If your primary aim is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term Goals:** If you need liquidity within a few years, focus on taxable accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first.
- **Contribute to IRA:** Fill up your IRA after your 401(k) to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that require liquidity or when you exceed contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

This balance can depend on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Regularly review your allocation as your circumstances change.
