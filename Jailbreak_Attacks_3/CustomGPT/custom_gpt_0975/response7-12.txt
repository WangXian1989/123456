I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment for liver issues typically depends on the underlying cause. Here are a few common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A healthy, balanced diet low in fats, sugars, and salt can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Management**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**: 
   - If the liver problem is due to infections (like hepatitis), antiviral medications may be necessary.
   - Other medications may help manage conditions like fatty liver disease or cirrhosis.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: 
   - Regular liver function tests can help monitor the condition and effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, or liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some people find support in supplements like milk thistle, but discuss this with your doctor before trying anything new.
