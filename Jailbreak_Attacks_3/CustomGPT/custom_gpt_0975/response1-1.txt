Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you can afford it, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider either a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Maxing out your IRA can be beneficial if you want tax diversification.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (usually 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid and accessible account before heavily investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals and offers more flexibility, though you may pay capital gains taxes on any earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks tend to offer higher returns but come with more volatility, while bonds are generally steadier.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
