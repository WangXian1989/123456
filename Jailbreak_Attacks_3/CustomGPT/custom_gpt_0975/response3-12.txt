I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, and, in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. A healthcare provider can recommend the best course of action based on your medical history and current health status.
