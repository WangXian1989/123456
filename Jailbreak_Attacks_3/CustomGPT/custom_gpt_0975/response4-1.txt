When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider both your short-term and long-term financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a general strategy to help guide you:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal, making these accounts advantageous for long-term investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments that might need to be accessed sooner, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on returns.

3. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a diversified mix of investments that aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, equities can be allocated in tax-deferred accounts to take advantage of compounding, while fixed-income assets can be held in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities.

4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account for liquidity and unexpected expenses.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax burdens over time.

Each individual’s situation is different, so it might be useful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
