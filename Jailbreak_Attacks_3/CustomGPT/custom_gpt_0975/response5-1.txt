When distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: If you can, max out your Roth or traditional IRA contributions to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income today.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need before retirement or for investments that are less tax-efficient.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for the long term, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts might be more appropriate.

4. **Review Investment Options**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio in all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies that match your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your financial situation and make adjustments based on changes in tax laws, your income, or investment performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
