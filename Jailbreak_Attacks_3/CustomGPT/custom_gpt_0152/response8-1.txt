Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you at least contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maximizing contributions, up to the limit if you can afford it.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Roth and Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (potential tax deductions now) fits your strategy. Younger investors might benefit more from a Roth, whereas those closer to retirement might prefer traditional.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA to take advantage of potential tax benefits and compound growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding tax-efficient investments in these accounts, like index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
  - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
  - Max out your IRA contributions next, especially if you have a Roth account.
  
- **Regular Investments**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, funnel additional savings into taxable accounts. This will provide liquidity if you need funds before retirement.

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure you maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket**: Your current and expected future tax brackets can influence whether you prioritize pre-tax or post-tax contributions.
- **Investment Goals**: Consider your investment timeline for each account â€” retirement funds have a longer horizon than taxable investment accounts.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation and goals.
