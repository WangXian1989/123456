To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes effectively.

3. **Tax Management**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains in taxable accounts. Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.
   - Withdraw from tax-deferred accounts in retirement strategically to minimize tax exposure.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial goals and tax situation.
