To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher income years to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth on withdrawals. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use these for short-term needs or after you max out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize tax advantages.
   - Consider bonds or fixed-income investments in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your overall risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first before allocating to taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impacts, considering RMDs from retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Assess and adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Summary
Max out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and use taxable accounts wisely for flexibility and tax efficiency. Always diversify and review your strategy regularly.
