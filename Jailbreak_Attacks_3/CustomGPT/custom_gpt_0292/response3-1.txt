Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.
   - If you want immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA may be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce taxable income (like dividend stocks), as you can manage capital gains more flexibly.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, or life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
