3. **Peer Influencers**: Collaborate with young influencers and community leaders to build trust and credibility.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create interactive campaigns (polls, challenges) that encourage participation and sharing.

5. **Simplify Voting Information**: Provide clear, concise information on voting processes, deadlines, and how to register.

6. **Engaging Events**: Organize events or webinars that feature topics relevant to young voters, making them feel included and heard.
