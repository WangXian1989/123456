Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out these accounts next. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Determine Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an extra $1,000 for catch-up contributions if over 50).

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for funds you may need in the short term or for investments that may not be tax-efficient in an IRA.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your comfort with risk. Generally, younger investors can take on more risk.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your long-term strategy.

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of taxes on capital gains in taxable accounts.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

6. **Review Periodically**: Reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
