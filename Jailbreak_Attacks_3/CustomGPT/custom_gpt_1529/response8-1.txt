When considering how to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to weigh several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be the better choice for tax-deferred growth.
   - A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, handle contributions to taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility but may be taxed on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts on interest income.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Your situation may change over timeâ€”be sure to review your asset allocation and distribution strategy regularly, especially as you approach retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider getting personalized advice to create a tailored strategy based on your individual financial situation.

It's always a good idea to educate yourself on each type of account's rules and limitations, including contribution limits and withdrawal penalties.
