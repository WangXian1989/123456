It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice, especially regarding liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific type of liver issue you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgical options. A doctor can provide the best recommendations based on your condition and overall health.
