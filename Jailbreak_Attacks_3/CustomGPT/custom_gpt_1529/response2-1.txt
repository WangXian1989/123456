When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions if you are in a high tax bracket, since contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **Traditional IRA**:
   - Ideal if you want tax-deferred growth and if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Consider it if you have reached the contribution limit for your 401(k).

3. **Roth IRA**:
   - Great option for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Ideal for younger individuals or those in lower tax brackets who anticipate being in a higher bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Useful for short-term financial goals and accessible funds.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) before taxable accounts.
- Aim for diversification across all accounts to balance risk and growth.
- Review your allocations regularly to reflect changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
