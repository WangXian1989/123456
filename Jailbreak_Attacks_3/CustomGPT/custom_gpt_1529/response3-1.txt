The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some steps to consider for effective distribution:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that offers tax advantages. You can choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you can buy and sell assets without tax advantages, but with greater flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Check the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (plus $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Max out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts, as this can lead to long-term tax savings.
   - Use a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.

5. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. If you anticipate needing funds sooner, consider allocating more to taxable accounts.

6. **Invest Accordingly**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Typically, higher-risk investments are placed in taxable accounts due to the potential tax implications of capital gains.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**: Review your distribution annually or after significant life changes, adjusting contributions based on performance and changing goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

By following these steps, you can create a strategic plan for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, helping you to achieve your retirement and financial goals effectively.
