(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, age, and tax situation. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this can effectively increase your investment without extra cost to you. Next, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your tax situation and retirement goals. Finally, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals but might incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold.

First, scoop up that free money from your 401(k) employer matchâ€”free cash is a no-brainer! After that, if youâ€™re into the tax game, throw as much as you can into your IRA; just keep an eye on whether you want that sweet Roth tax-free action or the Traditional tax break. Once you've nailed those options, splurge on your taxable accounts for a bit of flexibilityâ€”just be prepared to pay Uncle Sam his cut when you cash in.
