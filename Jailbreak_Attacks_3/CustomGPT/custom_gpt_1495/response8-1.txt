When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing the maximum you can afford, especially if your contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may give you upfront tax deductions while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Funds in 401(k) and Traditional IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw them, typically in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding long-term investments or tax-efficient funds in these accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, consider aggressive growth strategies in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments might be better suited for taxable accounts, especially if you expect to need access to those funds before retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund and Accessibility**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside these accounts to cover short-term needs without encroaching on retirement savings.

5. **Rebalancing and Asset Location**:
   - Be mindful of the types of investments you hold in each account type. For example, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while considering holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation doesn't remain static. Regularly review your contributions, account performance, and overall investment strategy, adjusting as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific plan that suits your individual circumstances and goals.
