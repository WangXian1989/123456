When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each type of account, as well as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great first step.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA & 401(k)):** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. For Traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. After maximizing contributions to these accounts, if you have additional savings, it may make sense to invest in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency and Asset Location:** Consider the tax efficiency of the investments. For taxable accounts, consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs), whereas tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) might be better housed in a tax-deferred or tax-free account.

5. **Diversification and Risk Management:** Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified and align with your overall asset allocation strategy.

6. **Liquidity Needs:** Taxable accounts offer more accessibility without penalties when you need funds before retirement age, so keep that in mind based on your personal financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation, as individual circumstances can vary significantly.

### Summary of Account Benefits:
- **401(k):** Employer match, tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA:** Potential for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Greater access and flexibility for withdrawals.

By creating a balanced strategy that utilizes all three types of accounts effectively, you can optimize your retirement savings and investment growth.
