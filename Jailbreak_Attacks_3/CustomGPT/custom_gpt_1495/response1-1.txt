The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you anticipate a lower tax rate, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for its immediate tax deduction.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs and aim to optimize usage if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide liquidity and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies. They donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but can be essential for managing cash flow.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider placing investments with high turnover or that generate significant taxable events in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying across asset classes in all types of accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to maintain disciplined investing. 

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and personal circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Ultimately, it's a balance between maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while keeping enough liquidity in taxable accounts. Assess your situation regularly to adjust as needed.
