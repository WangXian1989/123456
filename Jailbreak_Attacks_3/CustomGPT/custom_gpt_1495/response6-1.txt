To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Allocate funds based on your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect higher taxes later, focus on Roth accounts or taxable accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund & Debt Management:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. Pay down high-interest debt, as the return on eliminating debt often outweighs investment returns.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Balance your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and ensure you're diversified within those classes to mitigate risk.

5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review your investment strategy and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

By following a strategic approach, you can optimize your investment distribution for both short-term flexibility and long-term growth. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
