Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account (Traditional or Roth); offers tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts subject to capital gains tax; no tax advantages.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**

- **First Priority**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**

- **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals taxed as ordinary income.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**

- After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider fully funding your IRA (either type) for its tax advantages.

### 5. **Assess Contribution Limits**

- Be aware of annual contribution limits:
  - **401(k)**: $22,500 for 2024 (plus catch-up contributions if over 50).
  - **IRA**: $6,500 (plus catch-up contributions).

### 6. **Allocate Remaining Funds**

- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term savings or investments not covered by retirement accounts, understanding theyâ€™ll be taxed on dividends and gains.

### 7. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**

- Allocate your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 8. **Regular Review and Adjustments**

- Consistently review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, financial goals, and changing circumstances.

### Conclusion

This method balances immediate tax benefits and long-term growth potential while ensuring youâ€™re prepared for future financial needs. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
