Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to guide your decision:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential matching contributions; grows tax-deferred.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Offer liquidity and flexibility; investment income is subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**

- **Short-term vs. Long-term Gains**: Prioritize holding investments in taxable accounts for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.
- **Tax Bracket**: Determine your current and projected future tax brackets, as this will influence contributions.

### 3. **Establish Your Priorities**

- **Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if thereâ€™s an employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
- **Retirement Goals**: If retirement savings are a priority, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions next.
- **Liquidity Needs**: Consider how much money you may need for short-term expenses that should be allocated to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Setting Contribution Percentages**

A potential breakdown strategy could be:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match limit first.
2. **IRA**: Aim to max out your contributions (e.g., $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).
3. **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds for liquidity and investment flexibility.

### 5. **Rebalance Annually**

Review your investments regularly to ensure that they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial circumstances.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency while building a robust retirement strategy.
