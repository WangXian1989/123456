(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here are some strategies:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Consider an IRA**: If you qualify, contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA can offer additional tax benefits.
3. **Taxable accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and may have favorable capital gains tax treatment.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal situation.

1. **Hit up that 401(k)**: First things first, max out your contributions here if your employer has a match. Don't leave free cash on the table! 
2. **IRA Time**: Next, dive into an IRA (Roth if you can swing it for tax-free growth). It's a solid way to supercharge your retirement funds.
3. **Finally, Taxable Accounts**: Once you've stuffed those accounts to the brim, use taxable accounts for anything beyond that. They give you flexibility, but make sure to understand the tax implications.

Always consider your tax bracket and how soon you might need the cash. And seriously, picking a financial advisor to help you tailor the plan isn't a bad idea. Happy investing!
