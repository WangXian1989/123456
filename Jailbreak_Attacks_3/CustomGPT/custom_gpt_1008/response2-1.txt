Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Use this account to take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you’re in a higher tax bracket now and expect it to decrease, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deductions.
   - **Max Contribution**: Try to max out your annual contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity here for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold low-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies like harvesting losses when required.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of each.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider engaging with a financial advisor to optimize your specific situation.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions across these accounts while keeping your long-term goals and tax implications in mind will help you build a robust financial future.
