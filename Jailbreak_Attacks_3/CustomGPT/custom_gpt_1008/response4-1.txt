To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically allows for higher contribution limits. It grows tax-deferred, making it ideal for long-term savings.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and it also grows tax-deferred. Consider using it for further retirement savings after maxing out your 401(k) match.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investment strategy with your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This helps manage risk and investment strategy alignment over time.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about future withdrawal strategies. Taxable accounts can be easier to access without penalty before retirement age.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial circumstances vary widely; a professional can provide tailored advice based on your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to grow your investments while managing taxes and making the most of your contributions.
