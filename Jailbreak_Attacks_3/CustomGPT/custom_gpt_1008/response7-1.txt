Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First:**
   - Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for potential immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, such as stocks. They can be flexible for withdrawals and provide diversification.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Consider diversifying your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and market conditions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Financial Goals and Timeline:**
   - Adjust your contributions based on your short-term vs. long-term financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.

Always tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances, current laws, and your evolving financial goals.
