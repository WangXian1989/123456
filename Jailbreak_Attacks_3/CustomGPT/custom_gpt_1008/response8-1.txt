Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, with taxes due upon withdrawal.
   - Evaluate whether a Roth option (if available in your 401(k) or IRA) aligns better with your tax strategy, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - If youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider the tax implications of your investment choices; for example, holding high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your changing financial circumstances and retirement goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can offer personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, considering factors like age, income, debt, and investment knowledge.

By strategically allocating your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your savings for both short-term needs and long-term growth.
