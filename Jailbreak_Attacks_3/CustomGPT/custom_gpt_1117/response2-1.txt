When planning how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, including your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). Contribution limits and eligibility for tax deductions vary by income level.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside of retirement accounts. You pay taxes on capital gains and dividends in the year they are realized.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you are eligible for tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or can contribute to a Roth IRA.
   - Evaluate if a Backdoor Roth IRA is suitable for your income level.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds with high turnover) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), where they can grow without annual taxes.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors might consider a higher allocation to stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds or stable investments.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Establish a regular contribution schedule for all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging and stay disciplined with your investing.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations across these accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a certified financial planner or tax professional.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
