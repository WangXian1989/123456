When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to understand the purpose of each account type, their tax implications, and your overall financial goals. Here’s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, contribute the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, meaning you’ll owe taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This could be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell. Therefore, it’s best to hold investments with a long-term growth perspective here.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, consider how to allocate your investments within each account:
   - **Younger Investors**: Emphasize growth stocks or aggressive mutual funds in all accounts, particularly in your 401(k) and IRA, where tax deferral can enhance long-term gains.
   - **Older Investors**: Shift towards more conservative investments like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, especially in taxable accounts to minimize taxable events.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses, ideally in a high-yield savings account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**: Plan how you intend to withdraw funds:
   - Withdraw from your 401(k) and traditional IRA first to keep your taxable accounts growing.
   - Consider Roth accounts last to take advantage of tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits.

6. **Review Regularly**: Financial situations and tax laws change. Review your allocations and contributions annually, adjust for life changes (such as marriage, children, etc.), and rebalance your portfolio as necessary.

Utilizing a combination of these strategies can optimize your savings growth while managing taxes effectively for your financial future. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation is also highly recommended.
