When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, investment options, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach to help you:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: A retirement account offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, and taxes are owed upon withdrawal in retirement. 
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either Traditional (pre-tax contributions, taxes on withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages; you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Identify Your Goals**:
   - Determine if your primary objective is retirement savings, short-term needs, or a combination of both.
   - Assess your time horizon for each goal (e.g., when you'll need access to the funds).

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Generally, prioritize contributing to a 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, for its tax-free growth potential.
   - **401(k) and IRA Limits**: Stay aware of contribution limits. For example, in 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if over age 50) and IRA limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution).

4. **Address Investment Options**:
   - Review the investment choices available in your 401(k). Often, these may be limited compared to those available in an IRA or taxable account.
   - If your 401(k) has high fees or poor options, you might consider contributing less to it and focusing on your IRA or taxable account instead.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - With a Traditional IRA and 401(k), you'll defer taxes but will owe them in retirement, potentially at a higher rate. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes upfront, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be a good place to hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Balance your Distribution**:
   - Depending on your tax situation and financial goals, a common strategy is to fully fund your 401(k) to the match, then maximize your IRA contributions, and finally fund your taxable accounts.
   - A sample allocation could be: 50% to 401(k), 30% to IRA, and 20% to taxable, but this depends on your unique financial situation.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and tax laws change, or as you move closer to your goals.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: Finally, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation, especially regarding taxes and investment strategies.

By following these steps, you should be able to create an efficient distribution strategy for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
