Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income, such as dividend stocks or bonds, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before allocating significant funds to taxable accounts.
   - **Assess Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to lock in the lower tax rate now.

5. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**:
   - **Annual Review**: Regularly review your holdings and asset allocation in all three types of accounts to ensure they align with your investment goals.
   - **Adjust Contributions**: If your financial situation changes (e.g., salary increases, changes in expenses), adjust your contributions accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given the complexities of tax laws and the nuances of investment strategies, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor a distribution plan specific to your financial situation and goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund before significantly investing in any retirement account.

By following these guidelines and considering your unique financial situation, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy that leverages the advantages of each account type.
