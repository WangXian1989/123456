Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several individual factors, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Below are some general strategies to consider for optimal asset allocation across these account types:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so it may be useful for higher income earners. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it beneficial for younger individuals or those expected to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) regarding tax treatment, allows for tax-deferred growth, and contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and participation in a workplace retirement plan.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer time frame before retirement, you might choose a more aggressive investment strategy in taxable accounts, where capital gains taxes may be lower when held long term.
   - For assets needed in the short term, consider keeping them in more liquid, low-risk investments such as a savings account or a conservative bond fund.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. Consider asset classes like stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds during retirement. It can be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts last to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Continual Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your asset allocation to make sure it aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
