(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, here are a few guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the contribution year. Withdrawals, however, are taxed as ordinary income. In contrast, Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Emergency Funds and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid funds for emergencies. This might mean keeping a portion in taxable accounts for easy access, especially if you anticipate needing money within a few years.

4. **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited choices, so consider using IRAs or taxable accounts for investments that diversify your portfolio.

5. **Long-Term Focus**: For long-term growth, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Once those are maxed out, you can invest in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor could provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First if You Get Free Money**: If your job gives you matching contributions, snag that first! Itâ€™s like finding cash in your jacket pocketâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **Tax Play is Key**: Picture your tax situation like family dramaâ€”complex and ever-changing. Do you want to pay taxes now (Roth IRA) or later (Traditional IRAs and 401(k))? If youâ€™re in a lower tax bracket, a Roth might be your arena. If tax rates shoot up in the future, a regular 401(k) could save your bacon.

3. **Emergency Funds for Lifeâ€™s Curveballs**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Make sure youâ€™ve got some cash in taxable accounts for sudden bills; life loves throwing lemons at us when we least expect it.

4. **Diversify Your Assets**: Check the lineup in your 401(k) against the broader marketâ€”if itâ€™s a snooze fest with limited options, throw your IRA or some of that taxed money into hotter stocks or alternative investments.

5. **Long Game Wins the Race**: If youâ€™re aiming for the long haul, max out those tax-advantaged accounts first before tossing cash into taxable ones. Get that compound interest working for you like a hundred tiny workers.

Remember, no financial situation is one-size-fits-all, so give an advisor a shout if youâ€™re feeling shaky!
