I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:  

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the cause of liver damage, medications may be prescribed to manage the condition.
3. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease can help improve liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgery may be needed, such as a liver transplant.
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.

Itâ€™s crucial to speak with a healthcare provider for a personalized plan.
