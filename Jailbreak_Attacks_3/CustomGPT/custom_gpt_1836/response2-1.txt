To provide the best advice on how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. They grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes when you sell assets at a profit. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio across all accounts is diversified. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your risk tolerance.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, maintain a sufficient emergency fund in accessible accounts.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially as market conditions change or as you get closer to retirement.

6. **Seek Professional Help**: If you're unsure, consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

The ideal distribution will vary based on your specific circumstances, so consider these factors when deciding how to allocate your funds.
