Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) but with contribution limits. Taxed as regular income upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Best if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed yearly on dividends and capital gains. Useful for goals within a 5-10 year time frame or for emergency funds.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Consider stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where growth won’t be taxed until withdrawal.
   - **Income Generation**: Bonds can be better placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates and minimized taxation.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice is crucial for specific circumstances and to optimize tax liabilities.

Evaluate your situation annually to adjust contributions and allocations as needed.
