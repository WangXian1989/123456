Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize IRAs**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions often grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from your investment accounts. This typically should cover 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Ongoing Contributions**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

### 7. **Rebalance Portfolio**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances by consulting with a financial advisor, especially if your financial situation is complex.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
