Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Prioritize this if you have income limits that might affect contributions.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) for additional contributions, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains treatment, like stocks held for over a year. They can also be useful for savings goals outside retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure that your asset allocation remains aligned with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting as necessary based on market performance or changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Before selling any investments, be mindful of the tax consequences, especially in taxable accounts.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
