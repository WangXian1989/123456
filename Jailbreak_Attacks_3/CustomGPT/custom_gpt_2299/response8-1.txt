The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Account**: Take advantage of any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money." Contribute up to your employerâ€™s match before considering other accounts. If you can afford to, aim to contribute the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for funds you may need before retirement. Investing in taxable accounts allows for more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you also have an emergency fund in a savings account, separate from your investment accounts, to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments in each account. For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) since they grow tax-free or tax-deferred. For taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

6. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**: Distribute based on your timeline and risk tolerance. High-risk investments may be better suited for your long-term accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Ultimately, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
