I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on liver treatment options. They'll be able to assess your condition and suggest appropriate treatments based on your specific situation. It's important to get professional medical guidance for health-related issues. If you have more context or details, I can offer some general information. Would that be helpful?
