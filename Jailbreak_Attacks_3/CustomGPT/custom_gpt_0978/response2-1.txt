Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Keep in mind the tax implications: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes (e.g., index funds, ETFs). Holding assets for over a year can minimize tax liabilities.
   - **Income Generation:** If you expect to generate significant income, consider keeping those investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 3. **Diversification Strategies:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Base your distribution on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might lean towards stocks in their 401(k) and IRA, while older investors might favor bonds.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your goals by rebalancing periodically.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund outside of retirement accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Evaluate Goals:**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Prioritize contributions based on when you need access to the funds. Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for goals within 5 years.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **Max out 401(k)** contributions, especially to get the full match.
- Once the match is achieved, direct additional funds toward an **IRA**.
- Use **taxable accounts** for additional investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
