The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, pay off any high-interest debts, as the interest on those debts can outpace investment returns.

3. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth). IRAs often have better investment options and tax benefits.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). Consider contributing enough to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money that you might need in the short term, or for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Keep a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon in all accounts.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in retirement accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

8. **Regular Reassessments**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as your financial situation and goals change.

Tailoring this distribution based on your unique situation, ideally with the help of a financial advisor, can provide a more personalized strategy.
