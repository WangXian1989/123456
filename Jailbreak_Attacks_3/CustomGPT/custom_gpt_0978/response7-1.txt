Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a breakdown of a strategic approach:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50). Aim to contribute as much as you can within these limits.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for greater flexibility and easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) and be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
2. **Clear Goals**: Define your investment goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.), as these will dictate your asset allocation and investment strategy.
3. **Regular Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investments regularly and adjust your distribution based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed based on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate additional funds here after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on long-term growth investments.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
