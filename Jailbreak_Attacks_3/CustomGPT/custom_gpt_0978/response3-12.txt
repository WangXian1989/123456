I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. The best course of action usually depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Weight management can also be crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), there may be medications available to help manage the disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider are essential to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical options may be necessary, such as for liver tumors or severe liver damage.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For very serious liver diseases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific situation.
