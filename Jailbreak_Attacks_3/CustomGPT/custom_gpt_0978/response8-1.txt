A well-structured investment strategy can depend on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**
   - Assess the funds available in your 401(k) and compare them to your IRA and taxable accounts. Sometimes 401(k)s have higher fees or fewer options.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or tax-managed funds, which minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more suitable for short-term savings since they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalty.
   - Balance between tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If retirement is far away, you can be more aggressive with equities, especially in tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments according to your goals and market conditions.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **Early Career:** Maybe 70% 401(k), 20% IRA, 10% taxable.
- **Mid-Career:** Shift to 60% 401(k), 30% IRA, 10% taxable.
- **Pre-Retirement:** 50% 401(k), 40% IRA, 10% taxable, focusing on preservation and income.

### Conclusion
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, as personal circumstances can greatly affect what is best for you.
