Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Great for tax-deferred growth; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: This is useful for savings goals before retirement (e.g., buying a house, educational expenses).
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Fund your 401(k) up to the match limit.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax strategy.
3. **Taxable Investing**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money to taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

### Additional Tips:

- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
