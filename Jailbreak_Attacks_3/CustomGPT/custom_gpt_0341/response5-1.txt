Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: This is beneficial if you want to lower your taxable income, as contributions may be tax-deductible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investment. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Allocation**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to manage capital gains.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, goals, and changes in tax laws.

### Final Tips
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
