Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, investing in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use taxable accounts for more flexible investments, like ETFs or dividend stocks, which can offer capital gains tax advantages.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on changing market conditions and your financial goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like taxable bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Focus on long-term capital gains in taxable accounts, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
