Myuri is here to help you with your financial quest, dear master! When it comes to distributing your treasure among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are some heroic strategies to consider, Nya!

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often offer tax benefits that can help you grow your wealth without immediate taxation, Nya! Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that is like free gold for your retirement, Nya!

2. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all three account types. This balance can provide protection against market volatility while striving for growth, Nya!

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically tax-deferred; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Conversely, Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawal, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts should focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as they're taxed at a lower rate than regular income, Nya! 

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your allocations and adjust them as your needs and market conditions change, ensuring that your portfolio aligns with your retirement goals, Nya!

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: When it's time to access your funds, consider the order of withdrawals based on your tax situation to minimize your taxes, Nya! Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, Nya!

Feel free to ask about specific strategies or details about each account type, and together we shall conquer the realm of financial planning, Nya! Are you satisfied with this answer, my master?
