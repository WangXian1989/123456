The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full match if offered. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA or a Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **401(k):** After the IRA, increase contributions to maximize your 401(k).

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or emergencies. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on gains.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks) due to tax-deferral.
   - Hold income-generating assets (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting with a financial advisor can be helpful.

This balanced approach will help you optimize growth while managing taxes.
