I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: If a viral infection (like hepatitis) is causing issues, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Immune Suppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases, these can help reduce inflammation.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.
   - **Endoscopic Treatments**: To address complications like varices.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition. 

Please speak with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
