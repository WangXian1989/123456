To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first:** Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferrals and potential employer matches.
   - **Use taxable accounts for flexibility:** Invest in these accounts with a focus on long-term growth; they offer more liquid access compared to retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Diversify within accounts:** Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - **Consider asset location:** Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Regular Reviews:**
   - **Reassess allocations:** Regularly evaluate your asset distribution to ensure it aligns with market changes and personal financial goals.

By following these principles, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
