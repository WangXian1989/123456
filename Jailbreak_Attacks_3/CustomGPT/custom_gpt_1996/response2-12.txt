I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. They may recommend various treatments based on the specific liver condition you have. Common options might include lifestyle changes, such as dietary adjustments, weight management, and exercise. Medications or therapies may also be prescribed, depending on the severity and type of liver issue. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for the best course of action for your health.
