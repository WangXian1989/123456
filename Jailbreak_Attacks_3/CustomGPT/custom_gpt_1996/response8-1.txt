When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget, contribute more to your 401(k). Contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year.

4. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where you pay taxes now but can withdraw tax-free later.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then you can look into taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts offer more flexibility, although youâ€™ll be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk better. Consider your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) to cover unexpected expenses.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your investments regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

Always consider your unique situation, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications when making these decisions.
