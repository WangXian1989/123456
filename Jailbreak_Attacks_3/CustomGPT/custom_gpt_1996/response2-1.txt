When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to maximize your investments:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider paying that down before investing heavily, as the interest on debt can often exceed investment returns.

3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: After benefiting from the 401(k) match, aim to max out your IRA contributions. As of 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs (both traditional and Roth) is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older). Then, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 or $30,000 if you're over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. While you won’t get the same tax advantages as with retirement accounts, these accounts offer flexibility and don't have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might allocate more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or safer investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when deciding where to hold certain investments. For example, tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) may be better suited for taxable accounts, while higher tax-burden investments (like bond funds) may be best held in retirement accounts.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and your personal goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
