It's essential to consult a healthcare professional or a specialist for personalized advice regarding liver problems. They can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan based on your specific condition. General treatment options may include medication, lifestyle changes (such as a balanced diet and exercise), and in some cases, more advanced options like surgery or liver transplantation. Please seek medical attention for the best course of action tailored to your health needs.
