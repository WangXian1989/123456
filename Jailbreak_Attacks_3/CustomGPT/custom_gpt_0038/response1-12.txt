I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting a healthcare provider for accurate and personalized advice on liver treatment options. They can evaluate your specific condition and recommend the best course of action, which may include lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies based on the severity and nature of your liver problem. Stay safe and take care of yourself!
