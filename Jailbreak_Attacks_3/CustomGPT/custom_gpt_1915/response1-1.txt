When thinking about how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a company match, contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Advantages**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts can help you grow your investments tax-deferred (401(k)) or tax-free (Roth IRA).

3. **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, aim to max out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. In 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

4. **Investments**: In tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding assets that have the potential for significant capital gains or generate income (like bond funds), as the tax treatment will be more favorable. In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your planned withdrawal strategy for retirement. Different accounts may have varying tax implications upon withdrawal, so plan accordingly.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specifically to your circumstances.
