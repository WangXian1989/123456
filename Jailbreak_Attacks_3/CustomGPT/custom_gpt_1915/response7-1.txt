The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This allows you to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA** contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts** donâ€™t provide tax advantages, but you can manage capital gains and losses more flexibly.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified. This can help mitigate risk and may improve your overall returns.

5. **Retirement Goals**: Keep your long-term retirement goals in mind. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial, while a Traditional IRA might be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to decrease.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your liquidity needs. Taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties compared to retirement accounts, which have withdrawal restrictions.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments across all accounts to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
