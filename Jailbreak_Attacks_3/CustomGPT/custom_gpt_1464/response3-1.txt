Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions if possible. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Taxable accounts will have capital gains taxes on investment profits when sold. Consider holding investments long-term to reduce capital gains taxes.
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - If you're younger and many years away from retirement, focus on growth in retirement accounts (which may have higher volatility).
   - As you near retirement, shift towards more stable investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Keep a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Consider placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on interest.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first before tapping into retirement accounts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- Contribute 15% of your salary to the 401(k) (up to match limits).
- Max out Roth or Traditional IRA contributions.
- Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your personal situation.
