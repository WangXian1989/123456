Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your contributions (especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth).

### 2. **Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Use these accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, index funds) due to their tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in more tax-efficient assets (like ETFs or municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Brackets:** Be aware of your current and expected future tax brackets. You may want to prioritize Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Withdrawals:** Plan for when you might need to access funds. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are typically subject to taxes, while long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may have lower rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) to manage risk.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Review your allocations regularly to ensure they still align with your goals and risk tolerance, and make adjustments as necessary.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial objectives.
