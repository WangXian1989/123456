Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are generally for investments meant to be accessed sooner without penalties. Use them for assets that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments:** In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment mix across all accounts. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer or avoid taxes), while holding more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Revisit Annually:**
   - Review your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Maximize to employer match, then contribute up to IRS limits.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use remaining funds for additional investments, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor this strategy to your unique situation, especially regarding contributions limits and withdrawal strategies for retirement.
