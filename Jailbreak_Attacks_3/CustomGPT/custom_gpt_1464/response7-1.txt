To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Evaluate which type suits your tax situation better.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are tax-deferred; withdrawals are taxed as income. Good for those in higher tax brackets now.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax; withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**
   - Review the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) compared to your IRA and taxable accounts. Invest in lower-cost options where possible.
   - Utilize your IRA for investments that might have higher growth potential, as it allows tax-free growth (in the case of Roth) or tax-deferred growth (in Traditional).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner, as they have fewer penalties for withdrawals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and long-term financial goals.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If uncertain about specifics, speaking with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help you maximize growth and manage taxes effectively over the long term.
