To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Optimization**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow for tax-free growth until withdrawal. Prioritize contributions here for the immediate tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider funding this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account before maximizing retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align your investments with your goals and risk tolerance. Consider asset allocation that fits your retirement timeline.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Revisit your allocations regularly or as your financial situation changes, ensuring youâ€™re on track with your retirement goals.

If you're unsure specific percentages, consult a financial advisor who can offer tailored advice based on your individual situation.
