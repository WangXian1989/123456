(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money. After that, consider the investment options available.
   
2. **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Roth or Traditional IRA, the tax implications differ. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may be tax-deductible now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you'll need in the short to medium term, as they don't have the tax advantages of retirement accounts. Focus on more liquid investments or those that produce qualified dividends to minimize tax burden.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a smart move.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! When spreading your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it like layering a delicious cakeâ€”each layer serves a unique purpose! 

1. **401(k)**: First, throw enough into your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match. Itâ€™s basically like finding a five-dollar bill on the ground! After that, think about maximizing contributions if the investment choices kick butt.

2. **IRA**: Next, consider your IRA. A Roth is like putting money into a time machineâ€”you pay taxes now, but in the future, itâ€™s tax-free goodness! On the flip side, a Traditional IRA gives you that immediate tax break, so choose based on your crystal ball predictions for your future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Last stopâ€”taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re your go-to for anything you might need in a pinch. Just donâ€™t go dumping everything here; keep some for the short-term hustle to avoid tax headaches.

In the end, find that sweet balance, and if you still feel lost, it might be worth chatting with a financial wizard (a.k.a. advisor) to tailor it to your life situation. Now go rake in those dollars like a champ! ðŸ’°
