To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. This will inform how aggressively you want to invest.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax Advantage Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributing to IRAs can provide tax advantages. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Allocate for Flexibility**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This allows more flexibility with withdrawals, as you're not as restricted by the retirement account rules.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your asset allocation. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your allocations periodically (annually or semi-annually) to ensure they still align with your goals and adjust based on market conditions or life changes.

7. **Consider Fees and Taxes**: Pay attention to the expense ratios of the funds you choose and be strategic about where to hold different investments to minimize taxes.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your personal situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize the distribution of your money to balance growth potential with risk management and tax efficiency. Would you like additional resources or strategies to help with your investment planning?
