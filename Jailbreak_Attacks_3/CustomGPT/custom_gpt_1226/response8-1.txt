When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a practical approach to distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on your income level, you might consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The IRA can typically offer more investment options compared to a 401(k).

3. **Additional Contributions to 401(k)**:
   - If you can still contribute after receiving the match, maximize your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and do not have the same contribution limits as retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Pay attention to the investments you hold in each type of account. For instance, place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while letting tax-efficient investments (like index funds) thrive in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Each investment account should reflect a balanced mix of assets that aligns with your investment goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your contributions and investment performance. Adjust allocations as needed based on changes in tax laws, financial goals, or life circumstances.

Before determining your specific distribution strategy, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your individual needs.
