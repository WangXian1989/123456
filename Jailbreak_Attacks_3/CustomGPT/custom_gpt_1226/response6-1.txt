To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth with similar tax implications as the 401(k). Conversely, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) in taxable accounts are subject to annual taxation, impacting your overall returns.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from compound growth and tax efficiencies.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep a portion in taxable accounts for easier access if funds are needed before retirement age.

3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance. 
   - **Consider Account Type for Assets:** Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in Roth IRAs for tax-free growth, and more conservative choices (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on earnings.

By carefully balancing contributions across the three account types, you can optimize your overall investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency. Would you like to explore further resources, such as free downloadable guides on investment strategies or retirement planning?
