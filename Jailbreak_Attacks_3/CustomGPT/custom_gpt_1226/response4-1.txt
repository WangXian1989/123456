To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money. The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: For a traditional or Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older) in 2023. If you can, aim to max out this account as well.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made after tax, but earnings and withdrawals qualified for retirement are tax-free, making this account beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for more flexible investing without contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals. However, you will face capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps mutual funds or ETFs based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - In your taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds, which tend to generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review the allocations of your accounts to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. This can help you manage risk and capture gains.

5. **Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have losing investments in your taxable accounts, consider selling them to offset capital gains in other areas, which can help minimize your overall tax burden.

6. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund that can cover 3-6 months of living expenses, ideally in a savings account or low-risk investment.

In summary, start by maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts for tax benefits, then assess your investments for optimal tax efficiency and diversification. Finally, maintain flexibility with taxable accounts for additional investments and rebalancing as needed.
