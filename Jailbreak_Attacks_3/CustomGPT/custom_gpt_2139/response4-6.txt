3. **Focus on Issues**: Highlight issues that matter to them, such as climate change, education access, mental health, and social justice. Make it clear how policies impact their lives directly.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Engage through polls, quizzes, and interactive content. Encourage participation through online events, Q&A sessions, and live chats.

5. **Peer Influence**: Encourage young influencers or local activists to advocate for your cause. Their endorsement can significantly impact their followers.

6. **Accessible Events**: Host events in spaces where young people gather, like schools, community centers, or online. Ensure they are inclusive and affordable.

7. **Leverage Technology**: Use apps and websites for voting registration, information, and reminders. Ensure these tools are user-friendly and accessible.
