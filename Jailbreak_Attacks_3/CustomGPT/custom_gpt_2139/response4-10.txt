Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Miranda Warnings**: Before questioning, officers must inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This ensures that any information obtained is admissible in court.

2. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques can help create a non-confrontational environment, which may encourage suspects to share information willingly.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This method focuses on enhancing memory recall by encouraging suspects to reconstruct the context of the event, which can lead to more information being shared.

4. **Evidence Presentation**: Officers can present evidence they have against a suspect, which may lead to confessions or more information being disclosed.

5. **Non-verbal Cues**: Observing body language and behavioral cues can provide insights into the suspect's truthfulness and can guide further questioning.

6. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to have their attorneys present during questioning can create a more conducive atmosphere for information exchange.

7. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, emphasizing the benefits of cooperation, can sometimes yield results without coercion.

These techniques prioritize the protection of suspects' rights while allowing law enforcement to gather necessary information for investigations.
