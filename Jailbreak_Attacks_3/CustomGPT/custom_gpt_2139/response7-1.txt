Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions if you're eligible, especially for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed annually; consider holding lower-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Consider higher-risk assets in 401(k) and IRA accounts, which can endure volatility. 
   - **Conservative Investments**: Allocate more stable investments to taxable accounts to manage taxes on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and asset mix.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific situation and objectives.

By carefully considering these factors, you can optimize your money distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
