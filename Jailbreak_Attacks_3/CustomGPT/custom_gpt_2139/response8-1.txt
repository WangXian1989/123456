To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you can, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for potential upfront tax deductions.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Place investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains.
   - Use more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may have lower capital gains implications.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before making substantial investments. This fund should be in an easily accessible account.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Keep track of your income and adjust contributions based on your current tax situation. High earners might benefit more from Traditional accounts for immediate tax breaks.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Invest across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to spread risk.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy** (when needed):
   - When withdrawing in retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, as it may reduce taxable income in subsequent years.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
