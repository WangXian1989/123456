Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA) after maximizing your 401(k) match. This allows for tax-free growth.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit if you have additional funds left after your IRA contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Consider Tax Diversification**: Aim for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to manage your tax liability in retirement effectively.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger individuals might favor growth in stock-heavy 401(k) and IRA investments, while those closer to retirement may pivot towards bonds and preserved capital.

7. **Periodic Reviews**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing needs, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
