Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for reducing taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It’s beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Lower capital gains tax rates on long-term investments, but interest and short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary rate.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Place more aggressive investments in accounts that allow for tax-free growth (like Roth IRA) or tax-deferred accounts because taxes won’t affect your growth until withdrawal.
   - Consider more stable investments in taxable accounts, as you might need to access these funds sooner.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on your changing financial situation and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
