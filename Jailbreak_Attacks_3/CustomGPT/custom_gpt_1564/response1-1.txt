Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investing once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged options. They provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you want more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax exposure on gains.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
