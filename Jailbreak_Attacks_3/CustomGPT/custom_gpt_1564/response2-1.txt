Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim to max out if you can.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Balance Between Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are tax-deductible, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have shorter time horizons or need liquidity.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Keep income-generating investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts, as they are often taxed at regular income rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
