Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Fund 401(k) to Limit**: After maximizing the match, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These offer flexibility and may be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and time horizon. Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Capital gains taxes apply to taxable accounts, while tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) help delay tax payments.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio as needed to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.
