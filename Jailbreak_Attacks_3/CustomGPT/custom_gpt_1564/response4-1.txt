To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices but can include employer stock; check fees.
   - **IRA**: Typically offers broader investment options, giving you more flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for liquidity. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatments (like index funds).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals to minimize tax implications, potentially using taxable accounts first, then traditional 401(k)/IRA, and lastly Roth accounts.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and how soon you plan to access the funds. Typically, a more aggressive approach works with longer time horizons.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's always beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
