Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of employer matches, contribute to an IRA (either a Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax strategy. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: After maxing out IRA contributions, focus on contributing more to your 401(k), especially if you have access to a good selection of low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investing that you may want to access before retirement. They can also offer tax advantages through long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Keep in mind your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect a higher bracket, a Roth option could be advantageous.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you’re diversifying within each account type to balance risk and growth potential.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your contributions and investment performance to align with your goals and change your strategy as needed.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, it might be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.

Remember, your strategy should align with your individual goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
