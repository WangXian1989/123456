The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings. Aim to contribute up to at least the match limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax rate versus expected future rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts and still want to invest, put your money into a taxable account. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across your accounts. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while using tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth assets that may generate more short-term capital gains.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your allocation regularly to maintain your desired risk level and ensure it aligns with your retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal situation.
