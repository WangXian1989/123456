The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your financial situation allows for it.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions depending on your income, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. You should choose based on your current taxation situation and anticipated income in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts or are unable to contribute due to income limits, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of capital gains tax on investment profits.

4. **Overall Balance**: A common strategy is to use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth investments, while holding more liquid or shorter-term investments in taxable accounts. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your allocations and investment options periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.
