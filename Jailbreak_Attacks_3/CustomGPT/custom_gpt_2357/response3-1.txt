Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider this for long-term growth, but remember you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) in terms of tax deferral. If you’re eligible, max this account out after your 401(k) contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for flexibility and short-term needs. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, which may generate less taxable event income.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If your timeline is long, focus on maxing out retirement accounts first. If you need access to funds sooner, balance your contributions more evenly, including taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. This will ensure your strategy aligns with your income, savings goals, and investment preferences.
