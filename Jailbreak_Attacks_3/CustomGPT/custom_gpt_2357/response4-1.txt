Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

3. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. Keep an eye on your investment options to ensure they're suitable for your goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts don’t have contribution limits and offer immediate access to funds, although they may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to manage tax burdens more effectively.

6. **Long-term Planning**:
   - Consider your projected income needs during retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be taxed at your ordinary income rate, while distributions from a Roth IRA can be tax-free.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights and optimization based on your specific circumstances.
