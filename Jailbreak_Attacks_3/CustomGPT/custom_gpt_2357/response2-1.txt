Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider if a Roth IRA or traditional IRA is better for you based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. The allocation can be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts, as the tax impact is deferred or avoids taxes altogether.
   - **Rebalance:** Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation, regardless of account type.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies here to minimize capital gains taxes. Prioritize holding bonds and actively traded stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes—consider the order of withdrawals from accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Keep a liquid emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from your investment accounts.

### 5. **Investment Horizon:**
   - Adjust your investments based on how long you plan to keep the money invested. Longer horizons can afford to take on more risk.

### 6. **Regular Contributions:**
   - Automate contributions to ensure consistency. This takes advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of gross income, up to the match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** Contribute any additional funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion:
Balance is key. Aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your financial goals while making the most of tax-advantaged accounts.
