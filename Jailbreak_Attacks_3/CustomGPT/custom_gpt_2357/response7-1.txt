To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match since it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Brackets**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider utilizing Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals later.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments, like stocks, as they can benefit from compounding. 
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Needs**: Use these accounts for investments that you may need sooner or for goals outside of retirement.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts. This can include stocks, bonds, and alternative investments, maintaining the same overall investment strategy in each account for balance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax implications. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and your life situation.

By blending these strategies, you can optimize your investment across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while minimizing your tax burden and enhancing your growth potential.
