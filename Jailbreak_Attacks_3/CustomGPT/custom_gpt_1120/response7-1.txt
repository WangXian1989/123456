Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. It's suitable for those who expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more flexible in terms of withdrawals and do not have contribution limits. However, interests and dividends are taxable in the year they are earned.

### 3. **Prioritize Savings Based on Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for money you'll need in the next few years.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for retirement savings. 

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and timeframe.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Assess and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough for the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions here if eligible (consider Roth or Traditional based on tax strategy).
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out 401(k) and IRA, allocate any remaining funds here.

This setup can help you balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
