Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them an attractive option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments you may need to access before retirement or for assets expected to generate high dividends or interest, which may be taxed annually.
   - Balance investments to minimize your tax burden, placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and higher-yield assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments based on your comfort with risk, keeping in mind the time horizon for each account.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Use diversified investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and growth potential effectively.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as markets change and your financial goals evolve.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
