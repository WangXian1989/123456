Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for potential tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for short-term goals or after-tax investments. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - Younger investors may focus more on growth-oriented investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

5. **Review Fee Structures**:
   - Compare fees and expenses associated with the investments offered in each account type. Opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.

6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:

- **401(k)**: 50% 
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Marking Guides:

1. **Percentage Contributions**: Allocate based on retirement needs and employer matches.
2. **Investment Types**: Ensure a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets.
3. **Tax Strategy**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
