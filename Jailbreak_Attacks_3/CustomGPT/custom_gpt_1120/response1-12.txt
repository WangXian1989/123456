I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition. Common liver issues include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Here are some general options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Eat a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Exercise regularly.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
