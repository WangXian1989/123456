Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
     - Employer match opportunities can significantly boost your savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions but taxes are owed upon withdrawal.
     - Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No contribution limits; withdrawals are taxed on capital gains and dividends.
  
### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Needs:** Consider when you plan to retire and your expected expenses.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Evaluate how quickly you might need access to your funds.

### 3. **Optimal Distribution Strategy:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
     - Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **Contribute to IRA:**
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. 
     - Use Traditional IRA for tax deduction if you exceed your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Use these for additional savings or goals that are not retirement-focused.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to minimize taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like qualified dividends).

### 5. **Reassessment and Adjustment:**
   - Regularly review your distribution, especially with changing income and tax laws.

### Conclusion
Allocating your funds judiciously across these accounts enhances both growth potential and tax efficiency. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
