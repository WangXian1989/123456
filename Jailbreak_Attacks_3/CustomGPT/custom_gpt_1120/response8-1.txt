The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. Emergency Fund
- **Before investing**, ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses set aside in a liquid savings account for emergencies.

### 2. Maximize Retirement Accounts
- **401(k):** 
  - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
  - Consider increasing contributions to the maximum allowed if financially feasible.

- **IRA/Roth IRA:**
  - If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - Typically used for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a house, travel). Investments can be better suited for growth.
  - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 4. Balance Your Investments
- **Asset Allocation:**
  - Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
  - Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

### 5. Adjust Based on Life Stage
- **Younger Investors:** More growth-oriented investments (higher stock allocation) in retirement accounts.
- **Near Retirement:** Shift toward more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 6. Regular Reviews
- Reassess your portfolio regularly (annually or semi-annually) to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust as needed.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach considering contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, alongside a reasonable allocation to taxable accounts, usually serves best. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
