Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if there’s a match. Consider the investment options and fees associated with the plan.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility but don't provide the same tax benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Prefer holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your investment strategy and contributions regularly (at least annually) to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

### Summary

- **Contribute to 401(k) up to the match**
- **Fund IRA after 401(k)**

This strategy will help maximize your retirement savings while managing tax implications effectively.
