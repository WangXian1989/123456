Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you decide how to allocate your money:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: If possible, try to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts provide tax advantages; for example, contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may be made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to receive the full match before directing additional funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund in place before investing heavily in any of these accounts. A common recommendation is to have three to six months' worth of living expenses saved.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider the tax implications upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don't provide tax benefits for contributions, capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at potentially lower rates than ordinary income.

5. **Investment Goals**: Your investment horizon matters. If you are saving for a long-term goal (e.g., retirement), your 401(k) or IRA may be ideal; for shorter-term goals, consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easier access.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you are diversified across your accounts. Different accounts may have different investment choices and tax implications that can affect your overall asset allocation.

7. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to ensure your investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

In summary, a balanced approach often involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, ensuring liquidity for short-term needs, and considering tax implications when determining how much to allocate to each type of account. It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
