To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high, use a traditional IRA.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains rather than income (e.g., stocks, index funds). This minimizes the tax impact since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly assess your allocations to ensure they stay aligned with your goals.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement: prioritize tax-deferred accounts first to allow tax-free growth in Roth accounts for longer.

### Final Tips:
- Re-evaluate your strategy annually based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
