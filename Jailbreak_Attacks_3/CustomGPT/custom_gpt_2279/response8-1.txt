Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions lower your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Balanced Contribution:** Consider contributing to both a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals).
- **Income Limits:** Be aware of income limits for Roth IRA contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility:** Use these for goals with a shorter time horizon (like buying a house).
- **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; try to hold investments long-term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Max Out Retirement Accounts:** Aim to max out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, then invest in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust allocations based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
