Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Usually offers tax-deferred growth and may include employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Focus on Taxation**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) up to the annual limits.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use these accounts to diversify your investment strategy. For example, stock investments might be better in a Roth IRA for their potential for long-term growth.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering which accounts to tap first for tax efficiency.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Strategy
1. **Max out your 401(k)** up to the match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. Use any leftover funds for **taxable accounts** for flexibility.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution based on your unique situation is crucial. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your needs and tax scenario.
