To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is tax-deferred, so it's great for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you qualify. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now but tax you upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment income that benefits from lower capital gains tax rates. Focus on tax-efficient investments.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity outside these accounts for emergencies. Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your financial goals. Use more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Keep conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk. Keep an eye on asset allocation to avoid being overexposed in one account.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Automate contributions to stay consistent. Increase contributions to your 401(k) and IRA as your finances improve.

6. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
