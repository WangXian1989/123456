When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation and retirement goals. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Both are tax-deferred, reducing taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Place growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding without immediate tax burdens.
   - **Income-generating Assets**: Keep bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-deferred accounts to postpone taxes on income.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure an appropriate mix of asset classes based on your risk tolerance and timeline for retirement.
   - Regularly rebalance across accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy Planning**
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, considering the order of withdrawals (usually starting from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts).

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial planner to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider the tax implications of each account type, and ensure your investment strategy aligns with your retirement goals. Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy as needed.
