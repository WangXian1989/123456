Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth:** Decide based on your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate.
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Funds can be accessed at any time without penalties, useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower rates.

### 4. **Prioritization Strategy:**
   - Start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (up to the match).
   - Then, consider funding an IRA (maxing out if possible).
   - Lastly, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional savings, using this for shorter-term goals or liquidity needs.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review asset allocation and performance; adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
