To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth. If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) limit for 2024 is $22,500; IRA limit is $6,500). Plan your contributions accordingly to maximize these tax benefits.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate different asset types based on the accountâ€™s tax implications. For example, consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, while placing investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Review the tax efficiency of your investment choices. In taxable accounts, favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable distributions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes, potentially withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and consider the tax implications of selling assets in your taxable accounts.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, working with a financial advisor can provide a tailored plan that suits your financial situation and goals.

This structured approach can help maximize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
