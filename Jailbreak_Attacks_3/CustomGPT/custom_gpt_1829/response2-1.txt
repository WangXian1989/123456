Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if your finances allow.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and can offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After youâ€™ve contributed to your retirement accounts, you can add to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Distributions from these accounts are typically taxed as ordinary income. Planning when and how much to withdraw in retirement can impact your tax situation.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that you're diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within your investment strategies. This can help manage risk.

5. **Long-Term Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance should influence how aggressively you invest in each account type. Younger investors may lean more towards equities in tax-advantaged accounts for growth.

6. **Revisit and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Financial situations change, so regularly review your asset distribution and adjust your contributions based on performance, changes in income, or life events.

### A Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Retirement Focus (401(k) + IRA)**: 70% of total savings
  - 401(k): 40%
  - Traditional IRA: 20%
  - Roth IRA: 10%

- **Taxable Accounts**: 30% of total savings

This distribution can be adjusted based on your specific needs. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
