To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors: 

1. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term investment goals. Retirement accounts typically serve long-term goals.

2. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals during retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains, interest, or dividends earned are taxable in the year they are realized.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50.
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50.
   
4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and diversify your investments. Generally, you might hold more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts and safer, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement, as different accounts have different rules for withdrawals.

6. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

7. **Financial Consultation**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation.

By evaluating these elements, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and minimizes your tax burden.
