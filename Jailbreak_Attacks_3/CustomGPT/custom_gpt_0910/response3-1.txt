Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; often includes employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA), with different contribution limits and tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term needs**: Focus on taxable accounts for easier access.

### 3. **Max Out Contributions**:
   - If possible, max out contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matches.
   - Consider maximizing IRA contributions if eligible.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-producing investments (like bonds) that may be taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your investment distribution and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Use it for funds you might need soon or for specific goals (like a house down payment).

### Consult a Professional:
- Financial advisors can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture.

By tailoring your contributions to your personal situation, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
