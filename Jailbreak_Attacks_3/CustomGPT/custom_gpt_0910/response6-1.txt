Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
     - Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred, benefiting long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first for tax benefits.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's free money.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds; consider target-date funds if available.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that complement your 401(k) for overall diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impact.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** (up to the employer match).
- **Fund IRA** (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and tax situation).
- **Allocate remaining funds to a taxable account** (for flexibility or emergency needs).

### Final Thoughts:
- Review your investment strategy regularly and adjust based on performance, contributions, and changes in financial goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
