Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contribution. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-income years, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions first, especially if it offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate higher taxable income, like bonds or actively managed funds, since you’ll pay taxes on this income each year.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on long-term investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before maximizing contributions to investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of the account type.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly to stay aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about how and when you'll need to access your funds in retirement, as this can impact your distribution strategy.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
