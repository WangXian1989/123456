Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize your tax advantages and investment growth. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you can (for 2024, it's $23,000 for those under 50, and $30,500 for those 50 and older).
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose based on your tax situation: a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions today.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, maxing out a Traditional 401(k) or IRA can lower your taxable income. Roth accounts may be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider a Taxable Investment Account**:
   - Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments here, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across your accounts. Asset allocation (balancing stocks, bonds, and cash) should align with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon, not necessarily evenly across accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account the performance of investments and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Withdrawals in Retirement**:
   - Strategically plan withdrawals in retirement based on tax implications. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first could allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that considers your unique circumstances and goals.
