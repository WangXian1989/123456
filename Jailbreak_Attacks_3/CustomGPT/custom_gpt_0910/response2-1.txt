Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Focus on Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can reduce your taxable income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Whether to choose a Traditional or Roth IRA depends on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

### 3. **Build Up Your 401(k)**
   - After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short to medium term and for any investments that generate lower tax liabilities (e.g., long-term capital gains or investments in municipal bonds).

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Consider Your Goals and Timeline**
   - Align your investment choices with your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and time horizon (short-term vs. long-term).

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

This framework should help you make informed decisions based on your unique situation!
