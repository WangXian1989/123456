The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if you can. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow faster. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Consider Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

4. **Account Type Matters**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawals. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while profits from taxable accounts may be taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Your timeline can affect distribution; if you're planning for retirement in the long-term, focus on growth-oriented assets in your 401(k) and IRA. For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in a taxable account to maintain liquidity.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your portfolio grows, regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.
