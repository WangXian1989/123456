The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth accounts).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This can be in a savings account, not tied up in any of the three account types.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, so consider putting investments with high expected returns or high turnover in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Individual Circumstances**: Tailor your strategy based on your age, retirement timeline, and financial goals. Younger investors might favor growth assets, while those closer to retirement might focus on stability and income generation.

It's often beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to create a strategy that meets your specific needs and situation.
