2. **Lifestyle Modifications**: 
   - Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption.
   - Engage in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

3. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the underlying liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), a healthcare provider may prescribe specific medications.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor your condition.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide a personalized treatment plan based on your specific liver condition and overall health.
