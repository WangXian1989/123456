(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's recommended to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a potential order of operations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions depending on your income.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest any additional money in taxable accounts. Here you may want to consider the tax implications of your investments.

It's essential to regularly reassess your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
