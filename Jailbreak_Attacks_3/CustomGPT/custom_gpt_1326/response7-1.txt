Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider your tax situation and whether you have high-fee investment options in your plan.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If you can contribute to an IRA, it can provide tax advantages either through tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA). Evaluate your eligibility for Roth contributions based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are accessible without penalties. This is suitable for shorter-term goals and provides flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in these accounts. 

The best strategy typically involves prioritizing contributions based on employer matches first, followed by tax-advantaged accounts, and finally, taxable accounts. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances, risk tolerance, and investment timeline.
