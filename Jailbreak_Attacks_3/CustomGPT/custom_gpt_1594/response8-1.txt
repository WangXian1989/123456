When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible (reducing your taxable income) but will be taxed as regular income upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If eligible, consider maximizing these contributions for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk and optimize returns based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Consider Retirement Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, strategize how to withdraw from these accounts to minimize tax liability while meeting your income needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Always remember to periodically review your strategy as your circumstances and market conditions change.
