Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Take advantage of employer matches if available; it’s essentially free money. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match before moving to other accounts.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, whereas contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account. This can help manage risk and enhance returns.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use them for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Focus on Long-Term Growth:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments, as the compounding effect can significantly increase your retirement savings.

5. **Maintain Adequate Liquidity:**
   - Ensure you have enough funds in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs without penalties or additional taxation.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions, and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
