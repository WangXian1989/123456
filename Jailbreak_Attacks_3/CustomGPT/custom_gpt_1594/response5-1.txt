(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. The tax-deferred growth can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs also provide tax advantages, particularly if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that are less tax-advantaged. They also provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

Balancing these accounts can optimize long-term growth and manage your tax burden effectively.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really boils down to a mix of strategy and personal circumstance, but here's a fun take:

1. **401(k)**: Go all in here first! If your employer's tossing in matches, itâ€™s like free money raining from the skyâ€”grab it! Maxing out your contributions is key. Tax-deferred growth is a magic potion for your retirement.

2. **IRA**: Think about your future selfâ€”sheâ€™s gonna love a Roth IRA if your income allows it! Tax-free growth is like having a VIP backstage pass to your retirement party. If you think youâ€™ll be making less when you retire, rock a traditional IRA instead.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for your financial side hustles. No penalties for getting your money out anytime? Heck yes! Plus, you can play around with investments that might not be fit for tax-advantaged accounts.

In short, load up the tax shelters first, but donâ€™t forget your liquid cash for fun or emergencies! Mix it up according to your life goals and financial vibe.
