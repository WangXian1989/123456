To effectively allocate your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. Aim to at least get any employer match in your 401(k) since it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax advantages as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type, keeping in mind your risk tolerance and investment goals. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts. Typically, this is 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account.

5. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Think about your long-term retirement strategy. Different accounts may have varying time horizons and investment opportunities.

Ultimately, the right mix will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
