Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These have no tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices. Capital gains tax applies on profits.

2. **Investment Horizon and Goals**:
   - **Retirement Goals**: If retirement is your main focus, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Funds you need in the next few years should be in more liquid or conservative investments, typically in taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - Consider placing lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they often generate interest, which is taxed annually.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment mix across all accounts aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation in response to changing financial situations, market conditions, or tax laws.

By carefully weighing these factors, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes your tax advantages.
