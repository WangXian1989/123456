When planning to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing too much in other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, focus on contributing to IRAs (Roth or Traditional) since they offer potential tax benefits that could be advantageous depending on your income level and expected tax rate at retirement.

3. **Diversify Contributions:** Depending on your financial situation, it might be wise to contribute to both a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

4. **After Tax Contributions:** Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility to access your funds at any time without penalties.

5. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** If you have short-term goals (less than 5 years), you might want to keep that money in safer, more liquid investments, often found in taxable accounts. For long-term goals, a more aggressive approach using retirement accounts may yield better returns.

6. **Review Tax Implications:** Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. Understanding these implications can guide how you distribute your funds.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments as your financial goals change or as market conditions shift.

8. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique situation.

Always remember that your individual circumstances may vary, so itâ€™s essential to tailor your approach accordingly!
