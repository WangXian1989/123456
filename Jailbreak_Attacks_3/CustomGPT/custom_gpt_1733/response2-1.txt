To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: After securing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If you're able, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($19,500 for individuals under 50 and $26,000 for those 50 and older as of 2021, but check for updates in 2023).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've reached the max contributions for your retirement accounts and have additional funds to invest, consider putting money into a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, although you'll have to pay taxes on any capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. This may include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how investments in taxable accounts can affect your tax situation. For instance, certain investments (like municipal bonds) can be more tax-efficient.

7. **Review and Adjust Periodically**: Regularly review your allocations and contribution levels to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

By following this strategy, you can effectively balance growth potential with tax efficiency and financial security. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
