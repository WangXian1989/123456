(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, try to max out annual contributions to your IRA as well, which can offer tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** Consider the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

3. **Allocate Investments Wisely:** Your asset allocation should align with your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth, while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts to allow for easier access if needed.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations as necessary based on market performance and your financial situation, ensuring you stay aligned with your goals.

5. **Keep Your Eye on the Prize!** ðŸŽ¯ Regularly check on your allocations. If something's underperforming, don't hesitate to make moves!
