To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your plan offers a match, prioritize contributing to it. You can also benefit from higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions for contributions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These accounts allow for capital gains and qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. It might be strategic to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset allocation annually and adjust your contributions if necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy based on your personal circumstances, investment goals, and retirement timeline.

This approach will help you balance growth and tax efficiency as you save for retirement. If you need more detailed advice specific to your situation, let me know!
