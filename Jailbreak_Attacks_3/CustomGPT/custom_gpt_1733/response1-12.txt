I'm not a medical professional, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare provider. They can assess your specific condition and recommend appropriate treatment options based on factors like the type of liver disease, its severity, and your overall health.

Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms or slow disease progression, and in severe cases, procedures or surgery. If you're looking for specific advice or options, it's best to have a conversation with your doctor or a liver specialist.
