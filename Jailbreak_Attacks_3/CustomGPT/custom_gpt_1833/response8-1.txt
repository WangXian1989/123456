When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some strategies to keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to employer-sponsored accounts like your 401(k) if they offer a match, as this is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. Contributions may reduce your taxable income now, and growth in these accounts is tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2024, for instance:
   - 401(k): $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+)
   - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+)

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and retirement goals. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can be mixed based on your strategy.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of the investment types:
    - Place higher-growth and higher-interest investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to avoid immediate taxation on gains.
    - Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategies for retirement to optimize tax liabilities. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs), as tax implications vary upon withdrawal.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to adjust to market conditions or changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If feasible, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor strategies specifically to your financial goals and situation.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work towards your long-term financial goals. Always adapt your approach based on personal circumstances and market conditions.
