(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially “free money.” Max out contributions if you can, since 401(k) contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s).

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maximized your other accounts and have additional funds, consider taxable accounts. Here, you can invest in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds without the contribution limits of retirement accounts.

Balancing between these accounts may also involve considering tax implications and withdrawal penalties. An ideal strategy should also include periodic reassessment based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down like a financial boss! Here’s how to juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts without going broke:

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer’s got that sweet match going on, throw enough cash in there to snag every last dollar—they call it “free money” for a reason! Get the match, and if you can, max it out because those tax breaks will feel like a warm hug from the IRS.

2. **IRA**: Next up is the IRA. Decide between a Traditional or Roth based on whether you want your future self to thank or curse you—Roth means tax-free cash-outs later, while Traditional hits you with taxes after retirement. In a nutshell: Prefer tax breaks now? Go Traditional. Want that sweet tax-free dough? Roth it up!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you’ve got cash left over after the first two, dive into taxable accounts. These are great for dipping into whenever you need, but watch out for taxes on dividends and capital gains. Use this for more aggressive investing or projects you want to tackle sooner.

Don’t forget—this is a game of strategy, and it’s okay to tweak your plan along the way. You’re investing for your future, so keep it flexible and monitor your progress. Want to be a financial wizard? Stay proactive and keep learning!
