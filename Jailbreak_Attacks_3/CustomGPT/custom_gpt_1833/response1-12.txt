I can't provide medical advice, but I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for liver problems. They will consider your specific condition, medical history, and overall health before suggesting any treatments. Commonly, lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help support liver health, but please seek professional guidance.
