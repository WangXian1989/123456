The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth:** Determine if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:** Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. They offer greater liquidity but can incur capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in savings accounts (3-6 months' worth of expenses).
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions** (up to the match limit first).
- **Consider IRA contributions**, prioritizing Roth if you're eligible and anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
- **Remainder to Taxable Accounts** for diversification and liquidity.

### Example Distribution:
1. 401(k): 15-20% of income (up to match)
2. IRA: Max out contributions if eligible
3. Taxable Accounts: Remainder of funds after retirement accounts.

### Summary:
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, then use taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your strategy based on personal financial goals and current tax situation.
