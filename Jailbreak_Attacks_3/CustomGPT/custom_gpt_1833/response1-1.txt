When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize employer matching contributions first. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income, like bonds or REITs. This allows you to maintain tax efficiency, specifically by holding investments that generate long-term capital gains instead of ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes to manage risk effectively. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to appreciate significantly, allowing for tax-free growth.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantage accounts and more stable investments, which may generate income, in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, consider how and when you withdraw from each type of account to minimize taxes.

It's essential to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal financial situation and goals.
