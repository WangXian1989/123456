Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you make the best decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawal in retirement incurs income tax.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any gains are subject to capital gains tax when realized. Taxable accounts offer flexibility but are less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding lower-growth investments (bonds) or those that generate qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: If you are closer to retirement, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments across all accounts to protect against market volatility.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have sufficient savings for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation for factors such as income level, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

In summary, allocate enough to get employer matching in a 401(k), then diversify contributions based on tax implications, growth potential, and retirement timeline.
