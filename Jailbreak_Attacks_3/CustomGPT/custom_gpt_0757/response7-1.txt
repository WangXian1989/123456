It’s important to consider various factors when deciding how to allocate your investments across different accounts. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it’s often beneficial to contribute enough to get any employer match, as that is essentially free money. Maximize contributions to benefit from tax advantages. Consider investing in a diversified mix of funds, including equities and bonds, based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level and tax situation, it might be advantages to prioritize one over the other. Generally, younger investors may benefit more from a Roth IRA if they expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility. You can invest in a diverse array of assets, and you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

4. **Allocation Strategy**: 
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation among accounts based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Older investors may want to reduce risk over time.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth assets (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) to defer or avoid capital gains taxes, while more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can go into taxable accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you are not overly concentrated in any one asset class across your accounts.

It's best to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your overall financial situation and goals.
