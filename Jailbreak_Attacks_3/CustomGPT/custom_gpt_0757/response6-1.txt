When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account several factors, including tax implications, your current financial situation, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here are some key points to consider for optimal allocation:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax benefits while contributing, but with different withdrawal rules.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are made with after-tax dollars, and you’ll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

2. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and how soon you plan to access the funds. For instance, funds in a 401(k) or IRA are typically intended for retirement and can benefit from long-term growth.
   - Allocate a higher percentage to riskier assets (like stocks) in accounts with a longer time horizon (like a 401(k) or IRA) to take advantage of compound growth.

3. **Maximize Employer Matches and Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages, especially if you qualify for tax deductions.

4. **Diversification Across Account Types:**
   - Distributing investments across account types can enhance liquidity options and manage tax liabilities effectively.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains, while holding higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

In conclusion, a balanced approach that prioritizes tax efficiency, reflects your investment timeframe, and aligns with your overall financial strategy will serve you well in distributing your funds among these accounts. Regularly assessing and reallocating based on performance and changes in your financial goals is also crucial.
