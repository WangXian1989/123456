To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income and deferring taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax). Understand the tax benefits of each type. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they are realized.

2. **Define Your Goals**:
   - Determine your long-term vs. short-term financial goals. If saving for retirement is your priority, lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. 

3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after ensuring youâ€™re maximizing your 401(k) match.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep high-growth, high-volatility assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in 401(k) and Roth IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider holding more stable investments or bonds in your taxable account, as they may generate more taxable income.

5. **Consider the Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impact. For example, you may want to start withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess the performance and allocations of your accounts to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice, especially regarding tax implications and personalized investment strategies based on your financial situation.

By carefully considering these factors and regularly monitoring your investments, you can create a balanced and effective portfolio that meets your financial goals.
