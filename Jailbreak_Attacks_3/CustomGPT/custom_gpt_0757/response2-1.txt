Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility with withdrawals and potentially lower long-term capital gains tax rates on investments held for over a year.

3. **Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is far off, consider putting more funds into tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to maximize growth. If you are nearing retirement, it may be prudent to maintain a balance between these accounts for easier access to funds, especially if you want to minimize penalties or taxes on withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your overall investment strategy, even within each account.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a well-funded emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing funds prematurely, which could incur penalties or taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances by discussing it with a financial professional who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation and goals.

In summary, a balanced approach that maximizes employer contributions, takes tax implications into account, considers your time horizon, and maintains a diversified portfolio can be beneficial.
