Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can be directed towards taxable investment accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you want the flexibility to access your funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each type of account. For example, tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) impact your taxable income in retirement. Taxable accounts allow for easier access to funds but come with capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that all your accounts are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash, etc.) according to your risk tolerance. 

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Each individual's situation is different, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
