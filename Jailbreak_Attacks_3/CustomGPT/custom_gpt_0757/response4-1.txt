When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income level, a traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose the one that best aligns with your tax strategy.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Taxable accounts typically don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. For this reason, it may be beneficial to place investments that generate high taxable income, such as bonds or actively-managed funds, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA). Conversely, investments expected to appreciate significantly over time, like stocks, can be beneficial in a taxable account since they qualify for favorable long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Regardless of where you invest, maintaining a diversified portfolio is crucial. Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and growth objectives. Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk profile.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan ahead for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications, and strategizing withdrawals can save you money in taxes.

6. **Professional Advice**: Depending on your financial situation, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor. They can help create a personalized strategy for allocating your funds across different accounts while considering your overall financial picture.

In summary, the best distribution depends on leveraging tax advantages, your financial goals, and maintaining a diversified investment strategy.
