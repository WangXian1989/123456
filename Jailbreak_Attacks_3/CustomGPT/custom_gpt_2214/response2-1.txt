The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the IRS limit), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may lower your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for investments you might need to access before retirement. Keep in mind that dividends and capital gains may be subject to taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to minimize risk.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your liquidity needs when deciding how much to allocate to taxable accounts. These funds can be accessed without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your financial goals and time horizon. Longer-term investments may warrant a more aggressive strategy.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your investment strategy to ensure it still aligns with your goals, especially after major life changes (like marriage, having children, or retirement).

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's often beneficial to get personalized advice from a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.

By carefully considering the above factors and creating a balanced strategy, you can optimize your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
