I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver issues. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition you're experiencing. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, and, in some cases, procedures. Please seek medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment options.
