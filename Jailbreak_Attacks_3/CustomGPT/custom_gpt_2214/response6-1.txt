Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your overall tax burden.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you may want to balance risk by shifting more towards fixed-income investments, especially in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For long-term growth, allocate more to stocks in all accounts, particularly in taxable accounts where capital gains can be managed.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically reevaluate your asset allocation based on market conditions and changes in your life circumstances.
   - Adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk profile across accounts.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific situation.
