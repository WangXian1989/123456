To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: First, familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

2. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Often, this is where you start because many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially “free money.” Contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Maximize your contributions to an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money that you might need before retirement or for long-term investments that do not benefit as much from tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Assess Asset Allocation**: Determine your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) that might generate capital gains, while holding more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) in your taxable account, as they are subject to different tax treatments.

4. **Review Tax Implications**: Understand how taxes affect your investment returns. Interest from bonds in taxable accounts can be taxed at your income tax rate, whereas qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Create a Balanced Portfolio**: Ensure your overall portfolio is balanced according to your financial goals. This may mean rebalancing between accounts as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Keep track of your investments and adjust your contributions and asset allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following these steps and adjusting your strategy as needed, you can effectively distribute your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your retirement savings and investment returns.
