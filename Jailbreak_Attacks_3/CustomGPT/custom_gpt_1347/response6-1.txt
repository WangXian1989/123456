When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to balance factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some optimized strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you're eligible, fund a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing the 401(k) contribution.
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like a traditional 401(k) or IRA) for investments likely to grow significantly or generate high returns, as this minimizes immediate tax liability.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short to medium term, as they provide flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.
   - Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable tax rates.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts, which can defer taxes on larger gains.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating assets in tax-advantaged retirement accounts, where your tax payments are deferred or minimized.

Review your financial situation and long-term goals regularly to adjust your strategy as needed. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice to align with your specific circumstances.
