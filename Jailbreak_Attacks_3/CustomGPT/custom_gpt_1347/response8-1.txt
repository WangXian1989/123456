Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considerations such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The tax treatment differs—traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k). It allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’ve maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts, consider placing additional savings in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand that distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates. Plan withdrawals accordingly to manage tax burdens in retirement.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes within all your accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
