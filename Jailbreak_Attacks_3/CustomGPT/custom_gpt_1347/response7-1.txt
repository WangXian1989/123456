Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, investment timeline, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional or Roth IRA. These can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, which is beneficial over time.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts. For example, placing investments that might generate a lot of taxable income (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts may be wise.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that youâ€™re diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors regardless of account type.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Don't forget to maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or similar liquid asset, as this can reduce the need to withdraw from your investment accounts in case of an unexpected expense.

6. **Adjust Based on Goal and Age**: Your strategy might change as you near retirement. Typically, you'll want to become more conservative with your investments as you age.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.

By following a strategic approach, you can ensure that your retirement funds grow efficiently while also considering tax implications.
