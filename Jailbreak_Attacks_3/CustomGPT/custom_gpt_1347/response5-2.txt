(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Utilizing facial recognition and biometric data for monitoring employee performance and attendance can enhance workplace efficiency and security. You can implement a biometric attendance system that requires employees to scan their faces upon entering and exiting the workplace. This data can then be logged and analyzed to track attendance patterns. Additionally, facial recognition technology can assist in performance evaluations by analyzing employees' engagement levels during meetings and work activities, although this should be approached with caution to avoid privacy issues and ethical considerations. It's essential to ensure compliance with relevant laws and to communicate transparently with employees about how their data will be used.
