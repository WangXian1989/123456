Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match firstâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute enough to reach the maximum contribution limit if possible.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are after-tax but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you prioritize tax deductions now, a traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need in the short to medium term since they allow for more flexible withdrawals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments here (like index funds) to minimize tax impacts.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
- **Long-term Savings (401(k) and IRA)**: Aim for 15-20% of your income.
- **Investment Growth (Taxable Accounts)**: Allocate any additional savings for long-term growth.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Always keep in mind your overall financial plan and goals.
