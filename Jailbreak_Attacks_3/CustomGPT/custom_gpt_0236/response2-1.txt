To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; then aim to max it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Otherwise, a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **Allocate Based on Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep less tax-efficient income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts, as these can lead to taxation even in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize investments with higher growth potential in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals, opt for more stable investments in your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes.
   - Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix and risk profile.

6. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep up with annual contribution limits and adjust your savings strategy accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals.
