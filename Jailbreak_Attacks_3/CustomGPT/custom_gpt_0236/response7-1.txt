To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Optimization**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize this for tax-deferred growth. Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Choose between traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawal) based on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate different asset classes across accounts. For example, place more aggressive investments in taxable accounts (which benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates) and conservative investments in 401(k) and IRAs.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts before maximizing contributions.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type and consider maxing out retirement accounts first for tax benefits.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes and ensure sustainability of income.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.
