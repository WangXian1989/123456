Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Max out if possible, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can reduce your current taxable income.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds. This strategy minimizes your tax burden.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in accessible savings accounts before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Long-term Strategy**
   - Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time to retirement. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary
1. Max out 401(k) contributions, especially to snag employer matches.
2. Contribute to IRAs based on your tax situation.
3. Use taxable accounts for longer-term, low-turnover investments.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
