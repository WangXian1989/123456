Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; good for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for short-term goals or to provide liquidity. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk toleranceâ€”stocks for growth, bonds for stability.
   - **Time Horizon**: Consider when you'll need access to funds. Long-term investments can take advantage of compound growth.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in cash or a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation to stay aligned with changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Max out to match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to either Traditional or Roth based on tax implications.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds for flexibility and short-term goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your specific situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
