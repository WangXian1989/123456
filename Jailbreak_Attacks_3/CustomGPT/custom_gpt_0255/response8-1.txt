Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions (but taxes on withdrawals in retirement).

### 3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to retirement accounts, invest in a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you exceed contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you’re young and far from retirement, higher-risk investments may be suitable. As you get closer, shift towards more stable, lower-risk options.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. Consider asset allocation strategies that fit your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional savings based on your goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
