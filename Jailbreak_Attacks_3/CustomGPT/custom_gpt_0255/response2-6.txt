1. **Social Media Campaigns**: Utilize platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat for creative and relatable messaging.

2. **Authenticity and Relatability**: Present authentic voices that resonate with young people's experiences and concerns.

3. **Issues that Matter**: Focus on issues like climate change, education, and social justice, which are often top priorities for this demographic.

4. **Interactive Events**: Host virtual and in-person events that encourage participation, such as town halls or music festivals with voter registration booths.

5. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Leverage student organizations and influencers to drive conversations and mobilize their networks.

6. **Simplify the Process**: Provide clear information on how to register and vote, making the process accessible and easy to understand.
