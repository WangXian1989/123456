I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance. 

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications might be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Avoid alcohol or reduce intake, as it can worsen liver issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments and tests to monitor liver health and adjust treatment as needed.
4. **Managing Conditions**: Control diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure if applicable.
5. **Supplements**: Some patients benefit from specific vitamins or herbal supplements, but consult your doctor first.

Please see a medical professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific diagnosis.
