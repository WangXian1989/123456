Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax strategy.
  
### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial for short-term needs or to take advantage of capital gains rates.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Accessibility**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep a portion in taxable accounts for unexpected expenses.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Strategically withdraw from accounts during retirement to stay in a lower tax bracket.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other vehicles to mitigate risk.

**Recommendation:**
- **401(k):** Maximize employer match
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the maximum allowed
- **Taxable accounts:** Use for flexibility and investment opportunities

### Keep Reviewing
Regularly reassess your portfolio based on market conditions, tax laws, and personal goals.
