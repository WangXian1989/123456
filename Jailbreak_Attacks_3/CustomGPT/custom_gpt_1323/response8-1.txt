Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages, depending on your income.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions are often tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here grow tax-efficiently, but dividends and capital gains are taxed annually.

### 3. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Focus on long-term growth (stocks, ETFs) since these accounts are for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient funds (index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavy investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account, typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement. You might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review your strategy annually to adjust for changes in income, employment status, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Conclusion:
Diversifying your investments across these accounts can optimize your taxes and prepare you for a secure retirement. It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
