2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**:
   - Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests are important.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant might be necessary.

6. **Manage Underlying Conditions**:
