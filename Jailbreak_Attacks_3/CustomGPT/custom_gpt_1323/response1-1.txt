Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Consider contributing the maximum allowable, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Roth IRA (If Eligible):** If you're eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Use if you need a tax deduction now or if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you want more immediate access to your funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Asset Allocation:** Balance your investments between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your goals.

### Considerations:
- **Age & Time Horizon:** Younger investors may lean more towards aggressive growth, while those closer to retirement might focus on preservation and income.
- **Tax Implications:** Consult with a financial advisor to optimize your strategy based on your personal tax situation.

This tailored approach can help you make the most of each account type while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
