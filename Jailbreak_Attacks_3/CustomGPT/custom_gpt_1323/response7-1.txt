To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Generally offers pre-tax contributions, which can reduce your taxable income now. Consider using this account for higher growth investments that you'll need to access later.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). If your income allows, this can be used to further reduce tax liability.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free. This is ideal for investments you plan to hold long-term, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider allocating more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can occur tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds or interest-generating assets to minimize the impact of taxes on income.

4. **Rebalance Annually:** Ensure your allocations reflect your risk tolerance, time horizon, and market changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor strategies to your specific situation or objectives.

This diversified approach can help optimize your tax situation while aiming for long-term growth.
