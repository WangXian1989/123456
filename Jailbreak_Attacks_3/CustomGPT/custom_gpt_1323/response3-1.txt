Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so be mindful of turnover and dividend income.

### 3. **Build an Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Inside your 401(k) and IRA, aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on long-term investments to mitigate taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For tailored advice, consider consulting a professional to align your investment strategy with your specific situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions annually if eligible.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

This strategy helps optimize tax efficiency and growth potential over time.
