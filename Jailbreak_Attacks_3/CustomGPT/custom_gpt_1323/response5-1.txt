Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, retirement timeline, and financial goals. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out either your 401(k) or IRA based on contribution limits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth. You won’t pay taxes until withdrawal, helping your investments grow more efficiently.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or emergency funds. Investments in taxable accounts can generate tax-efficient growth, especially in index funds or ETFs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts because you’ll benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax implications.
   - Consider holding lower-return, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level as markets fluctuate.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you’re closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial expert.

This approach ensures you’re making the most of tax advantages while aligning with your financial goals.
