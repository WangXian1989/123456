To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the full match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth), depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) in terms of tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they're received, and capital gains are taxed on realization.

4. **Asset Location**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts. This strategy can minimize taxes over time.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Regular rebalancing helps maintain your desired investment strategy.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

7. **Long-term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and overall financial goals.
