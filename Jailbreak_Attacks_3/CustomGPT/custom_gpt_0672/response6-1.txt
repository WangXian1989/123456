To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, providing immediate tax benefits, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax benefits; however, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, provided certain conditions are met.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment growth is subject to capital gains taxes, which could be advantageous for investments held long-term.

### 2. Prioritize Contribution Levels
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to receive your employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to both Roth and Traditional IRAs to take advantage of different tax benefits.
- **Supplement with Taxable Investments**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility.

### 3. Create a Balanced Asset Allocation
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as market conditions and your personal situation change.

### 4. Consider Withdrawals Strategy
- **Withdrawal Order**: Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. This can help minimize tax implications in retirement.

### Final Thoughts
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities in tax laws and regulations, consider working with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that fits your financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can efficiently manage your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
