When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several strategies to consider, depending on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first – it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made before tax, and you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. This can provide flexibility, but be mindful of the tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to reduce risk. Your allocation may differ by account based on tax implications and investment horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when to take withdrawals. In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts, depending on your income needs and tax situation.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique financial situation, including your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and current financial needs.
