When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and your investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice between these two depends on your current tax rate and expected tax rate in retirement:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can begin putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties before retirement age. However, keep in mind that investment gains will be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Depending on your time horizon, you may want to allocate more aggressive investments in your taxable accounts to take advantage of potential long-term capital gains, while focusing on debt reduction or conservative investments within your retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and investment goals might change over time, so regularly review and adjust your allocations accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: To create a personalized plan, especially if your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help optimize your investment strategy based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, the best distribution strategy will vary based on individual goals, so it's crucial to consider your personal financial situation.
