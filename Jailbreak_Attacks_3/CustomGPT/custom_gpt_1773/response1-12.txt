I'm not a medical professional, but treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you're facing. Common options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions such as hepatitis.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical intervention might be needed, especially for conditions like fatty liver disease or tumors.
5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe cases, such as end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be considered.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
