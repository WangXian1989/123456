When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some key points to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, particularly if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k), as these can vary significantly between plans. Aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,000 for 2021; $7,000 if over age 50) and prioritize contributions up to these limits after maxing out the 401(k) match and contributions.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s. Diversifying your investments here can help reduce risk.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawal without penalties, making them suitable for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of buying and selling investments within these accounts. Long-term investments typically face lower capital gains taxes than short-term investments.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. Keep investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or tax-managed funds) in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA. After that, direct additional funds to your taxable accounts.
- **Balance Growth and Risk**: Distribute your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts, keeping in mind that retirement accounts should focus on long-term growth.
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
