Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding each account's benefits, tax implications, and your financial goals. Here’s a general strategy for allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) before moving on to taxable accounts. This helps lower your taxable income in the current year.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once you have maximized your contributions to retirement accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider factors like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

6. **Adjust Based on Age**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, gradually shift your asset allocation towards safer investments to preserve capital.

7. **Monitor and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about the best allocation strategy for your situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.

Remember to consider your specific financial situation and goals when determining how to allocate your money across these accounts.
