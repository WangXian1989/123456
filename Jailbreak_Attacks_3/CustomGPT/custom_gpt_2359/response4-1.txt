To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Focus on maximizing contributions as long as it aligns with your budget.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so they can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) offer tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts provide no upfront tax savings but allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund. The tax impact of capital gains should be factored in; consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, plan how you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it's often advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation:**
   - Life changes and market conditions should prompt regular reviews of your investment distribution. Adjust contributions and allocations as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider seeking personalized advice to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your individual financial situation and goals.

This balanced strategy aims to maximize growth, minimize taxes, and ensure liquidity as you progress towards retirement.
