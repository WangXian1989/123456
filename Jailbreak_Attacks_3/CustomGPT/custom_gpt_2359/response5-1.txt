Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

### 2. Focus on Tax Efficiency
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits (tax deferrals or tax-free growth).
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxable withdrawals).

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends to benefit from lower tax rates.
- **Bond Investments**: These are often best kept in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher ordinary income tax rates.

### 4. Diversify Asset Allocation
- Aim for a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes in each account type, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review and adjust your investment mix in each account to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a tax-advantaged account.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation, especially regarding tax implications and long-term goals.
