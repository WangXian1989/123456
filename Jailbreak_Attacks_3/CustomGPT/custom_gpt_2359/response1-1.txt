Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - If you qualify, consider maximizing your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth).
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Fund 401(k) to the Limit**
   - After funding your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Fund taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. This could include:
     - **Emergency Fund**: Keep a portion liquid for unexpected expenses.
     - **Short-Term Goals**: Invest for goals within the next 1-5 years.

### 5. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Consider higher growth investments in tax-advantage accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - Be mindful of tax implications:
     - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) will require taxes upon withdrawal.
     - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

### 7. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to ensure they align with your changing financial situation and goals.

### Summary
Start by taking full advantage of your 401(k) match, max out your IRA, then contribute more to your 401(k). Use taxable accounts for flexibility and shorter-term goals. Always consider tax implications and keep your investments diversified.
