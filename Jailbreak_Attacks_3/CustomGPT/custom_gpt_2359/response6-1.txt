Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If eligible, max out annual contributions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or long-term capital gains to minimize tax burden.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) here since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance among these accounts. For aggressive growth, lean toward equities in your 401(k) and IRA, while keeping safer investments in your taxable account.

### 4. **Investment Time Horizon**
   - Short-Term Needs: Fund taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-Term Needs: Favor retirement accounts to leverage compounding.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 40% (maximizing employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: 20% (max contribution if eligible)
- **Taxable Account**: 40% (diversified across stocks, bonds, ETFs)

### Periodic Review
- Regularly reassess the allocation based on life changes, market conditions, and performance of investments. Adjust as necessary to align with your goals.

This strategy can help optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
