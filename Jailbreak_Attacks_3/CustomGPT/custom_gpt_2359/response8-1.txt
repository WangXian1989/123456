Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Generally, taxable accounts are more suitable for short-term investments. For long-term growth, favor tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income and capital gains.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. This helps balance risk and return.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation. This is crucial for managing risk.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for your future withdrawal strategy. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs), leaving tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for last to maximize tax advantages.

### Sample Distribution: 
- **401(k):** 30-50%
- **IRA:** 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20-40%

### Final Tips:
- Adjust based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. 
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
