Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account allows pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you’re within your limit and if your plan has good investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, open an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth if you meet withdrawal conditions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. It's more flexible since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties (though you may have to pay capital gains tax).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Asset Location**: Hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (to protect them from taxes) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash or liquid investments set aside for emergencies before heavily investing in these accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for a personalized approach based on your specific circumstances.
