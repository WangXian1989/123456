Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantage**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
  
2. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain sufficient funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies. This offers more liquidity without early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Account Types**: Use your 401(k) and IRA primarily for long-term retirement savings, as they may have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes within each account. This includes stocks, bonds, and alternative investments, tailored to your risk tolerance.

4. **Account Order of Operations**:
   - Generally, prioritize contributing to your retirement accounts first before taxable accounts. For example, after getting the match in your 401(k), max out your IRA, and then resume contributions to your 401(k).

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and performance. Rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy while preparing for a secure financial future.
