Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider making contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer potential tax advantages (tax-deferred growth for Traditional IRA and tax-free growth for Roth IRA). 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for Traditional IRAs, while Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions but provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer tax advantages, but long-term capital gains rates may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) over taxable accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts might be more suitable to access funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across accounts, considering the types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) and their risk levels.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your distribution strategy to make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, investment performance, and life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your situation, it may be beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective plan to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial goals and maximize your investment potential.
