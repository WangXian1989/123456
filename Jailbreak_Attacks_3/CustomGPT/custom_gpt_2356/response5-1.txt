(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA as they offer potential tax benefits. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions, especially if there's an employer match.** This is essentially "free money" and can grow tax-deferred.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). This can provide additional tax benefits.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for money that you may need before retirement or for your other financial goals. Interest and dividends from these accounts are taxed, but they offer more flexibility.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your personal circumstances.

1. **Go all-in on your 401(k)** firstâ€”especially if your employer's serving up that sweet match! Seriously, it's basically free cash, and who'd say no to that?
2. **Next, tackle your IRA.** Decide between Traditional vs. Roth based on your current income. If you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later, go Roth; if not, Traditional is your friend!
3. **Finally, stash some dough in taxable accounts** for those mid-term goals, or if you just canâ€™t resist buying the latest gadgets. Just remember, everything you earn here gets taxed, so consider that before splurging.
