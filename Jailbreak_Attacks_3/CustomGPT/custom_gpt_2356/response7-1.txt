The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Continue to Contribute to Your 401(k)**: If you've maxed out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) to increase your contributions, especially if you are under 50, as you can contribute more than in an IRA.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you’re looking for more flexibility or if you have maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing surplus funds in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that long-term capital gains tax applies here, so holding investments for over a year can reduce your tax burden.

5. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**: Be mindful of the types of investments held in each account. For example, place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes on capital gains, and consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and interest.

Remember, everyone’s situation is unique, so it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a specific strategy tailored to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
