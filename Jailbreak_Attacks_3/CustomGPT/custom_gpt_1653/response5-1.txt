(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, income, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax preferences.
3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: If you're eligible, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after your IRA contributions.
4. **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable account, giving you flexibility for both short and long-term goals.

Diversifying the investments within each account type is also crucial for balancing risk and return.

1. **401(k) First**: Hit up that 401(k) and snag your employerâ€™s match like itâ€™s candy. Itâ€™s like a freebie on a shopping spreeâ€”donâ€™t leave it hanging! 
2. **IRA Next**: Once the match is secured, pour your love (and funds) into an IRAâ€”traditional if you want that tax deduction now, or Roth if you dream of tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
3. **Ramp Up the 401(k)**: Keep stuffing that 401(k) until you hit the IRS limit. Itâ€™s like maxing out your favorite video gameâ€”go for the high score!
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, after youâ€™ve loaded the first two, go wild with that taxable account. It gives you freedom and flexibility for whatever shiny new investment catches your eye.

Oh, and remember to keep an eye on the investment mix in each account. Diversify like youâ€™re building the ultimate playlistâ€”balance is key!
