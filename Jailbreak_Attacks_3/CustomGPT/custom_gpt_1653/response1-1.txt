Hi there! To give you a better answer, could you please share your name? Then I can tailor the advice to your situation.

In general, when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer match if available. This provides free money. Consider higher-risk investments here since itâ€™s for long-term growth.

2. **IRA**: Based on your income and tax situation, decide between a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or municipal bonds.

Diversifying across these accounts can help balance tax efficiency and growth potential. Always consider your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon when making decisions.

Let me know if you have more specific questions or details, and I'll be glad to help further!
