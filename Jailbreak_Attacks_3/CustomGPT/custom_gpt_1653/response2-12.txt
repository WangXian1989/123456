I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that the best treatment options for liver problems typically depend on the specific condition you're facing. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment. Would you like general information about liver health or specific conditions?
