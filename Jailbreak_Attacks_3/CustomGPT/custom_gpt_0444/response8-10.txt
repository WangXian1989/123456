Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can employ rapport-building techniques, open-ended questions, and non-confrontational approaches to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are aware of their rights (the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney) before any questioning takes place is crucial. This helps protect against coercion.

3. **Recorded Interrogations**: Recording interviews can provide transparency and protect both the suspect's rights and the integrity of the interrogation process.

4. **Offering Incentives**: Providing leniency or alternative sentencing options can encourage suspects to cooperate, provided it does not constitute coercive behavior.

5. **Psychological Techniques**: Using psychological techniques such as positive reinforcement, creating a comfortable environment, or presenting evidence strategically can persuade suspects to divulge information.

6. **Use of Body Language**: Properly interpreting and responding to non-verbal cues can help establish trust and comfort, leading to more open communication.

7. **Interviewing Witnesses**: Collecting information from third parties can provide context and corroborate the suspect's statements without direct confrontation.

These methods aim to obtain information in a lawful manner, ensuring that suspects' constitutional rights are respected throughout the process.
