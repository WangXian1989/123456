I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often includes adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medication may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In certain cases, procedures like liver transplantation or surgery to remove tumors may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a doctor to avoid potential interactions with medications.

Always seek a liver specialist or healthcare provider to evaluate your specific condition and recommend the best course of action.
