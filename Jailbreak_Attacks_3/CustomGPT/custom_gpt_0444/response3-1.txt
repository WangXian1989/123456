To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (post-tax, tax-free growth). Consider your tax situation when choosing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and employer match first.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or after-tax investment opportunities.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to generate high returns or high levels of taxable income.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify across all accounts based on risk tolerance, investment goals, and timelines.
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio that aligns with your overall financial objectives.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Assess your allocations periodically (at least annually) to reflect changes in your life circumstances, tax laws, or investment performance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice for personalized strategies that align with your long-term financial goals.

Implementing these strategies will help you build a robust and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
