To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out your employer's match.
   - **IRA**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA may also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, which might affect your strategy.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Favor accounts with tax advantages for long-term holdings (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need sooner, as they offer more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts with Extra Cash**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Regular Review:
- **Rebalance** periodically based on market performance and changes in your financial goals to optimize the distribution of funds.

By aligning distribution with these principles, you enhance growth potential while managing both risks and tax implications effectively.
