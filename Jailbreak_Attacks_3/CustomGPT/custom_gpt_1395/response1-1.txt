To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Focus on tax-advantaged growth, and choose investments with good growth potential.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for immediate tax advantages or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Diversify investments for growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax implications.

Evaluate your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon to tailor your contributions effectively. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
