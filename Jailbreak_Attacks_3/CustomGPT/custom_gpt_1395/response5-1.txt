(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it’s wise to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.” Next, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, since it offers tax-free growth. After reaching those limits, you can allocate funds to your taxable accounts, which offer flexibility but may have tax implications for dividends and capital gains. It’s recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
