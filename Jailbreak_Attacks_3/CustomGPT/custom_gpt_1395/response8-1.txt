To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit, especially if it's a Roth IRA which allows tax-free growth.

2. **Investment Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals:
   - Use your 401(k) for retirement savings.
   - Utilize your IRA for retirement funds but also consider the tax implications when choosing between a traditional and Roth IRA.
   - Allocate money to taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since these accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility.

3. **Fees and Expenses**: Be aware of fees associated with each account:
   - Compare the investment options and fees in your 401(k) plan.
   - IRAs may offer a broader range of investments, so shop around for low-cost providers.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investments to your risk tolerance:
   - Higher risk investments might be better suited for your 401(k) and IRA since you have a longer time horizon.
   - Consider safer, more liquid investments in your taxable account.

5. **Withdrawal Needs**: Plan based on when you expect to need the funds:
   - Keep in mind the penalties associated with withdrawing funds from retirement accounts before age 59Â½.

6. **Regular Review**: Frequently assess your investment strategy:
   - Adjust your allocations as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
