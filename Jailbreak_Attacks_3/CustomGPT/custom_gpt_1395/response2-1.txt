To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions. This helps you take advantage of tax benefits and potentially free money from your employer.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) accounts ($30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Tax Diversification**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account:
   - **401(k)**: Often holds a mix of stock and bond mutual funds. Keep higher-growth investments here to defer taxes.
   - **IRA**: Can invest in a broader range of options. Beneficial for Roth IRAs as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends) as you pay taxes on gains annually.

4. **Risk Management**: Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk. Allocate based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Lastly, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
