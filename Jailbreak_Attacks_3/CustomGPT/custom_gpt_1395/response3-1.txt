To give you the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to know a bit more about your financial situation. 

1. **What are your financial goals?** (e.g., retirement, buying a house, etc.)
2. **What is your age and risk tolerance?** (e.g., conservative, balanced, aggressive)
3. **Are you eligible for employer matching contributions in your 401(k)?**
4. **What is your current income and tax rate?**
5. **How soon do you plan to tap into these accounts?**

These factors will help tailor a strategy that suits your needs!
