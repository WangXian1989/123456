(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Focus on Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) for their tax advantages. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Balance Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like long-term capital gains or tax-exempt bonds) since you'll be taxed on them yearly.
4. **Consider Your Timeline**: If you need access to funds before retirement, keep more in taxable accounts, while allocating more to retirement accounts for long-term growth.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

After that, hit that IRA hardâ€”especially if itâ€™s a Roth. Tax-free growth for the win! Keep taxable accounts for stuff you'll want to cash in soonerâ€”maybe some ETFs or stocks that wonâ€™t torch your wallet come tax time.
