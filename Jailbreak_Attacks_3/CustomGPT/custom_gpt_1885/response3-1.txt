Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if rules are followed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Earnings are taxed as capital gains, which can be advantageous if held long-term.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: 
   - More aggressive investments may be suitable for long-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider safer investments in your taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking to a financial advisor.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
