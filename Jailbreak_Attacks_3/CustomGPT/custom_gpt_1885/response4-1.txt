The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you need a tax deduction, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may be less tax-efficient or for funds needed in the short term, as they allow easy access and typically have fewer withdrawal penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Location:** Place growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) where they can grow without immediate tax implications, while holding income-generating investments in taxable accounts to manage taxes more effectively.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice suited to your specific situation.
