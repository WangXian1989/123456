Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Retirement Plans**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**:
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider putting money here. Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you want to lower your taxable income now and expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is a good option.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within these accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals, rebalancing your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized strategies can greatly enhance your investment efficiency based on specific needs and conditions.

Assess your individual situation to make informed decisions that align with your long-term financial goals.
