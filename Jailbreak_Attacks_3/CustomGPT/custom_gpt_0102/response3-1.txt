Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have debt with high interest, consider paying it down first before heavily investing.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account.

4. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income level and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **401(k)**: After the match, aim to max out your contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you're maximizing your retirement accounts, consider a taxable account for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

7. **Consider Professional Advice**: If your situation is complex, consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (enough to get the match).
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of available funds after fixing debt and emergency savings.

This approach balances tax advantages with liquidity and growth potential, tailored to your individual circumstances.
