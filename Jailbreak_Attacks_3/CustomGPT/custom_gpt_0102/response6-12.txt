I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet (low in sugar and saturated fats).
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Completely avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
