It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems, but here are some common treatment options that may be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking enough water helps maintain liver function.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed.

3. **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can alleviate stress on the liver, especially in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are important to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

5. **Supportive Therapies**: In some cases, therapies such as antiviral medications for viral hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be needed.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek professional medical advice for a treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
