When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often tax-deferred; employer may match contributions. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged; choose between Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Ideal for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money".

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your match, prioritize contributions to IRAs (especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA, which may offer tax-free growth).

### 4. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize funding them according to their benefits.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Long-term growth investments may work well in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that generate lower taxes, like index funds or municipal bonds. Keep higher-tax-generating assets (like REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio. Changes in market conditions or life circumstances may necessitate adjustments.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your goals and financial situation.

### Summary:
1. **Max out 401(k) match**.
2. **Contribute to IRA** next.
3. **Use taxable accounts for flexibility**.
4. **Diversify investments** across accounts.
5. **Rebalance regularly**.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
