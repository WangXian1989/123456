Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching. Usually best for retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-advantaged; choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Suitable for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After employer matching, focus on maximizing your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).

### 4. **Consider Investment Timeline**
   - **Long-term Focus**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Funds needed in the near future should be placed in taxable accounts for accessibility.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy regularly to align with changing financial situations or goals.

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your circumstances.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions after securing the match.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate additional funds based on liquidity needs and tax efficiency.

By applying these strategies, you can optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency.
