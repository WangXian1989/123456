Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a broader range of investment options, including ETFs and mutual funds, which may not be available in a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to minimize tax implications. Consider holding investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals due to more flexible access without penalties, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation annually or after major life changes to remain aligned with your goals.

### Summary
Balancing your contributions effectively across these accounts will optimize your tax situation and investment growth potential. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
