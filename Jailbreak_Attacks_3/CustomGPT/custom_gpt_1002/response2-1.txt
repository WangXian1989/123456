When planning how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages:** 
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free.
   - Fund a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your asset allocation strategy with your retirement goals and time horizon. Retirement accounts usually focus on long-term growth.
   - For taxable accounts, consider investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Strategically plan for withdrawals during retirement; typically, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts first (401(k) or traditional IRA), followed by taxable accounts, and finally Roth IRAs, to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Stay Diversified:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
   - Keep track of asset allocation and re-balance as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, as they can provide insights based on current tax laws and market conditions.

Every individualâ€™s financial situation is unique, so tailor your approach based on your specific goals, risk tolerance, and time frame.
