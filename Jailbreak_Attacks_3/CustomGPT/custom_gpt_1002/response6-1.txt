Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first. This helps you take advantage of tax-deferred growth and potential employer matching contributions.
   - If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Allocate money to taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds soon, as you can access this money without penalties.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. Different accounts might serve different investment strategies based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to maintain your desired investment strategy and rebalance as necessary.

By carefully balancing contributions and considering the tax implications, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
