When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the current year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Consider this when planning your allocation.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but distributions in retirement will be taxed. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (if certain conditions are met). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on maxing out a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and no contribution limits, but you will owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Use these for investments that produce lower taxable events or if you need liquidity.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Given the tax-advantaged nature of these accounts, it’s often prudent to hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: It may be wise to hold more stable investments (like bonds) or investments that are taxed favorably (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: Consider your age and how close you are to retirement. Younger investors may want to take on more risk with higher equity allocations, while those closer to retirement might want to reduce risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your investment distribution and adjust as necessary. This might be annually or when there are significant changes in your financial situation or investment goals.

A sample distribution strategy could be:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer contributions and invest primarily in stocks.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA, focusing on growth-oriented assets.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for emergency savings or investments aimed at short- to medium-term goals with lower tax implications.

It’s always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
