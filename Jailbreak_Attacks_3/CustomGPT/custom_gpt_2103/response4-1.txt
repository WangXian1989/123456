Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** (tax-deferred): Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits and dividends, but they offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing. This fund should ideally cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to mitigate risk.

5. **Goals and Time Horizon**: Tailor your allocation based on when you plan to use the funds. Longer-term investments can typically be more aggressive.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Investment Options**: Look at the specific investment choices within your 401(k) and IRA. Often, IRAs might offer a wider range of investment options compared to a 401(k).
