Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow more efficiently. Decide between a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes. Therefore, for money you expect to withdraw in the near term, a taxable account might be more appropriate, whereas retirement funds can be held longer in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that you have a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help manage risk and improve returns over time.

5. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so it's important to review your distribution strategy regularly. Adjust your contributions based on income changes, market conditions, and life events.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
