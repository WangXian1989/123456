To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - *401(k) Contributions*: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money. 
   - *IRA Contributions*: Consider the tax benefits of a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - *Short-term vs. Long-term*: Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.
   - *Risk Tolerance*: Adjust asset allocation based on how much risk youâ€™re willing to accept in each type of account.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - *Taxable Accounts*: Favor investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) over interest (like bonds) to minimize tax burden.
   - *401(k) and IRA*: These accounts typically allow for tax-deferred growth, which can be advantageous for long-term investment.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - *Asset Allocation*: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
   - *Rebalance Regularly*: Ensure that your asset allocation remains consistent with your financial goals over time.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investments to achieve a balanced and growth-oriented portfolio. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
