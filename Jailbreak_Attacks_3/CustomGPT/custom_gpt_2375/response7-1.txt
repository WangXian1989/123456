Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages depending on your income level and retirement strategy.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you have funded your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). This will help you maximize your tax-deferred growth.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility since you can access them without penalties. Consider maintaining a balance here for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Review Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing money from these accounts in retirement, as different accounts will be taxed differently.

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a financial planner to create a strategy tailored to your individual circumstances.
