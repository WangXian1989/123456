Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After obtaining the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) since these accounts offer tax benefits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older) to an IRA.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k):** If you still have room to contribute after your IRA, or if your income exceeds the IRA contribution limits (particularly for Roth IRAs), continue to invest in your 401(k). The contribution limit for 401(k) plans is higher, at $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility and Gains:** Once you have maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any remaining funds into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw your money at any time without penalties, and you can invest in a broader range of assets.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains are taxed when sold, and interest and dividends are taxed as income.

6. **Asset Allocation:** Consider diversifying your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and goals. This may mean holding different investment types in your tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts, as assets that generate higher income (like bonds) might be better in tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Review Regularly:** Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure they align with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

It’s also advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
