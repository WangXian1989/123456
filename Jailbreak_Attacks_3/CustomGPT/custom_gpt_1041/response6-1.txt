Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for an effective distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as you’ll only be taxed on gains when sold. Consider holding lower-turnover investments here.
   - **Inflation Protection**: Allocate to investments in taxable accounts that outpace inflation to preserve purchasing power.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Liquidity Needs:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Generally for long-term growth; they can include a higher risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain some liquidity for short-term goals or emergencies, while also aiming for growth.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Life Stages:**
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus on aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRA, with moderate exposure in taxable accounts.
   - **Pre-Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments in retirement accounts while maintaining growth in taxable.

By carefully assessing your goals and tax considerations, you can optimize the distribution of your funds for both short-term needs and long-term growth.
