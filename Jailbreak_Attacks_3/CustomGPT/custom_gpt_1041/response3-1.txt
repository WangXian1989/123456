Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you can deduct contributions based on your income level, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you're eligible.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50 or older), and for an IRA, it’s $7,000 (or $8,000 if you're age 50 or older). 

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) allow you to defer taxes until withdrawal, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals but require after-tax contributions, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversification in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexible access to cash and investments. Keep in mind the impact of capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing and Asset Allocation**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Consider having a more aggressive allocation in tax-advantaged accounts, as they may not be accessed for many years.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate savings in a regular savings account or high-yield savings account for emergencies before focusing solely on retirement accounts.

By thinking strategically about how you allocate your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your tax benefits and investment growth for retirement. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your individual circumstances.
