Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines that may help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money first.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth; deductibility on contributions may vary based on income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on profits, and dividends are taxed annually, so this is often less advantageous for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in cash or liquid savings.

4. **Investment Strategy**: If you're younger or more risk-tolerant, a higher allocation to growth-oriented investments might be suitable. As you approach retirement, shifting to more conservative investments within these accounts can help protect your principal.

5. **Balance and Diversify**: Ensure that your investment choices across all accounts are balanced and diversified to mitigate risk. Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and performance, and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.
