When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money." For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your Traditional or Roth IRA contributions (up to $6,500 or $7,500 if you're 50 or older for 2023). Determine which type is best based on your current and expected future tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: If you need access to your funds in the near future, prioritize contributions to your taxable accounts. For long-term savings, focus on your 401(k) and IRA for their tax advantages.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Align your account types with your investment goals (e.g., aggressive growth strategies in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, while tax-advantaged accounts can be more growth-oriented).

### 3. **Review Your Overall Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to mitigate risks.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

By carefully considering these strategies, you can optimize your overall investment distribution for better growth and tax efficiency. If you would like more personalized guidance or tools to analyze your specific situation, feel free to share more details about your financial goals!
