I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general insights into treatment options for liver problems. Here are some common approaches, but please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This may include a healthy diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), certain medications may be prescribed to manage the condition.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are crucial.

4. **Supplements**: Some might benefit from vitamin E or other supplements, particularly for fatty liver disease, but these should be taken under medical guidance.

5. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy to assess damage or even liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to speak with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
