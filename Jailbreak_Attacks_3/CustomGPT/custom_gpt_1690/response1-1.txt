To help you effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. Next, contribute to your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, it might be wise to favor Traditional 401(k) or IRA contributions to reduce your taxable income. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, consider Roth options where contributions are made after taxes.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: Allocate some funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and short-term needs, as these accounts allow easier access to cash without penalties.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments reflect your risk tolerance and goals. Diversify across asset classes to balance potential risks.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation strategy based on market conditions, tax law changes, or shifts in your financial goals.
