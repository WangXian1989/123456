Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the match, then consider if you want to go beyond that based on your overall financial strategy.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.
   
3. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in long-term accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but have different tax implications (capital gains taxes).

5. **Investment Diversification:** Once you’ve determined how much to allocate to each account type, focus on diversifying your investments within those accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Revisit your allocation at least annually or after significant life changes.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
