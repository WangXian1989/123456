I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity aids in maintaining a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases, these can reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases of liver failure or cirrhosis, a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**:
   - Some people consider options like milk thistle, but always consult a healthcare provider first.

It's vital to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
