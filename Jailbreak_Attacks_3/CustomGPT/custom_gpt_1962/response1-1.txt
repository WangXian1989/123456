Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account covering 3-6 months of living expenses before investing heavily.

5. **Diversification**: In your taxable accounts, focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs. Consider tax implications when selling investments.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider meeting with a financial advisor.

This distribution can vary based on individual circumstances, so tailor these tips to your specific financial landscape.
