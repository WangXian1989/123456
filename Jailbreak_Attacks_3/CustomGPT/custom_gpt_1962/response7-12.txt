I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting fat, sugar, and salt.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - Alcohol: Avoiding alcohol is vital for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups can help track liver function and detect any changes early on.

4. **Nutritional Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin supplements, but it’s essential to discuss this with a doctor.

5. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, treatments like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or surgery for liver damage may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best plan tailored to your specific situation.
