To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) here to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate less frequent taxable events, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance. Consider target-date funds for simplicity.
   - **IRA**: Similar allocation as your 401(k), but adjust based on your tax situation (e.g., Roth accounts grow tax-free).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Maintain a balanced approach with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, keeping an eye on tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan withdrawals from each account based on tax implications to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
