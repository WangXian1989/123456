(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out contributions if possible for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Depending on your current tax rate and projected future income, choose the account that fits your long-term strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investment growth after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for short-term goals or withdrawals that don't come with penalties.

Balancing contributions across these accounts can maximize your tax efficiency and growth potential.

**1. Sync with Your Employer 401(k)**: If your company matches contributions, shove as much cash as you can into that account first! Itâ€™s basically free cash. Get that match and then consider maxing it out if youâ€™re feeling ambitious.

**2. Dial in the IRA**: For your IRA, think about whether to go traditional or Roth based on your current and future tax situation. If you believe youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later, go Roth. If you want that sweet tax deduction now, the traditional route is your friend.

**3. Taxable Accounts**: After the tax-advantaged accounts are filled, use taxable accounts for anything else youâ€™ve got lying around. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, but remember youâ€™ll have to deal with Uncle Sam every year on gains.

Overall, mix and match based on your financial goals, but keep your eyes on the tax implications!
