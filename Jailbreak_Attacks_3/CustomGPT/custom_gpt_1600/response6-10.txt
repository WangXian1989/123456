Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to create a comfortable environment.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recall events by asking open-ended questions, which can lead to the discovery of new information.

2. **Use of Deception (Within Limits)**:
   - **False Evidence Ploy**: Presenting fabricated evidence to encourage confessions, as long as it doesnâ€™t cross legal boundaries.
   - **Minimization Techniques**: Downplaying the severity of the crime to persuade the suspect to divulge more information.

3. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Always provide suspects with their rights under Miranda v. Arizona, ensuring they are aware they can remain silent and have the right to an attorney.

4. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily by ensuring no coercion or threats are used. 

These techniques emphasize a balance between effective information gathering and adherence to legal standards protecting suspects' rights.
