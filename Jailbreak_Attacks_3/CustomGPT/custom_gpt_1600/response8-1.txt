Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as income. They are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. These are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged contributions, use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs, which are generally more tax-efficient.
   - Consider holding investments with a long-term capital appreciation potential in taxable accounts since they benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to reduce risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when choosing asset allocation.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation across these accounts to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan that considers your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals can provide additional insight and guidance.

This approach can help optimize your taxes and investment growth over time.
