It's important to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy for your unique situation, but here are some general considerations for distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 401(k)s, the limit is often higher than for IRAs.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both grow tax-deferred; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider tax-efficient investment options.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Investments with low turnover and long-term growth potential can be in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing and Diversification**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.
   - Ensure diversification within each account type to reduce risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement**:
   - Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement, as this can affect how you want to allocate funds now.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so itâ€™s advisable to create a personalized investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
