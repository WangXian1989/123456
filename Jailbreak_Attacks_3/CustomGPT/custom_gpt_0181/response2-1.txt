Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Higher Income Years**: Focus on pre-tax contributions (401(k), traditional IRA).
   - **Lower Income Years**: Consider post-tax contributions (Roth IRA, taxable accounts).

### 3. **Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a mix of assets across accounts to minimize risk. Consider stocks in taxable accounts for potential tax benefits (long-term capital gains).

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan withdrawals from each account type for retirement or other needs, balancing tax implications.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: 15% of income (maximize match)
2. **IRA**: $6,500/year (if eligible)
3. **Taxable Account**: Remainder or as needed based on cash flow needs.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your situation.
