Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing this out next for tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for additional savings once retirement accounts are maxed.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: These accounts can grow tax-deferred, so prioritize contributions here.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on employer-provided investment options, often mutual funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Broader investment choices; diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves outside of these accounts before heavily investing.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique situation.

By strategically allocating funds, you can maximize growth potential while managing risk and tax implications.
