Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages, either deferring taxes or providing tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) or short-term investments, as these can be more efficiently managed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals across all accounts, keeping in mind tax implications for each type of account. 

5. **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
