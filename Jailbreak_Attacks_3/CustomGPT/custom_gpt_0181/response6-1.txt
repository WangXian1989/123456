To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy and eligibility.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Utilize after-tax funds for investments that generate minimal taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to reduce tax impact.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Favor taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Use tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding tax-free.

### 4. **Consider Fees and Expenses**
   - Minimize high fees in taxable accounts by choosing low-cost investment options.

This balanced approach allows you to optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
