Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in savings.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for tax-deferred growth, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks, index funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider strategies to minimize taxes, such as tax-efficient funds and holding onto investments for over a year for long-term capital gains.

6. **Annual Review**: Regularly reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

### Suggested Approach:
1. Contribute to 401(k) up to employer match.
2. Maximize IRA contributions (prioritize Roth IRA if eligible).
3. Use any additional funds for your taxable account, considering short-term vs. long-term goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor your distribution based on individual needs, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
