I'm not a doctor, but treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the specific condition. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare provider for your particular situation.
