6. **Provide Clear Information**: Make voting information easily accessible. Use visuals, infographics, and videos to explain the voting process, deadlines, and issues at stake.

7. **Focus on Issues**: Highlight issues that matter most to young voters, such as student debt, job opportunities, and climate policy. Tailor your message to show how your platform addresses these issues directly.
