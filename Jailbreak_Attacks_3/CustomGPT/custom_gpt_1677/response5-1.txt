Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax strategy, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can grow your investments more efficiently.

3. **Fund Your 401(k):** After maxing out the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit or your financial goals.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially for short-term goals or if you want greater liquidity.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account, especially as you approach retirement.

### Tailored Strategy:
- **Young Investors:** Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Mid to Late Career:** Balance contributions based on expected tax brackets in retirement, potentially favoring tax-deferred accounts.
- **Near Retirement:** Shift towards more conservative investments, ensuring you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

Consulting a financial advisor can help customize your strategy based on your unique situation.
