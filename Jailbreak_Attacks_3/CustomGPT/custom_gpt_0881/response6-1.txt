Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Contribution Priorities
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Once you've maximized the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for higher-income investments that may generate significant taxable income. 
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be held for shorter periods or for funds you may need access to without penalty.

### 3. Account Type and Investment Strategy
- **401(k)**:
  - Good for consistent contributions and employer matching.
  - Focus on diversified mutual funds or target-date funds.
  
- **IRA**: 
  - Consider using this for more aggressive investments, especially if tax advantages are favorable.
  - Roth IRAs are ideal for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
- **Taxable Accounts**: 
  - Ideal for individual stocks or bonds for potential capital appreciation.
  - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term.

### 4. Asset Location Strategy
- **Hold Bonds in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: To mitigate taxes on interest income, place bonds in tax-deferred accounts.
- **Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: If planned for long-term, stock capital gains may be taxed at lower rates.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions according to tax implications and investment goals can optimize your financial growth. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on life changes and market conditions.
