To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement. If your income exceeds the limits for a Roth, a Traditional IRA may be a suitable option.
   - **Increase your 401(k) contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k), especially if you can reach the maximum annual limit.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: 
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean toward tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they provide tax benefits for growth.
   - For short-term goals, prioritize liquidity with a taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure you maintain your target asset allocation and adjust contributions accordingly.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific financial situation and goals.
