Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are a few general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or dividends, as they can be taxed at your ordinary income rate. Also, consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments may be better suited for long-term accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, while conservative investments can be kept in taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of where you place your investments. For example, place bonds or high dividend-yielding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your situation.
