I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common approaches for liver problems might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and follow medical guidance for effective treatment.
