Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional or Roth IRA, especially if your income qualifies you for tax deductions or benefits from tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use the 401(k) for Higher Contributions**: If you're looking to save more, contribute to your 401(k) up to the contribution limits. The 2023 limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 for those under 50, with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those 50 and older.

4. **Consider IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income level and the type of IRA (traditional or Roth), aim to contribute up to the maximum limit for IRAs, which is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50) in 2023.

5. **Tactical Use of Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. This is useful for more flexible access to funds and potentially lower capital gains tax rates for long-term investments.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Finally, ensure that you have a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, taking into account factor such as risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.
