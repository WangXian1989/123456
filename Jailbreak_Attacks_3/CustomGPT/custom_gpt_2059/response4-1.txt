Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider, but it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match before contributing to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the employer match, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if you can. Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it may provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous over time.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timelines. Typically, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while holding bonds or less aggressive assets in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly reassess your distribution strategy and adjust as necessary.

Remember, this is a general guideline, and personal circumstances can dramatically influence the best approach. Consulting with a financial professional is highly recommended for tailored advice.
