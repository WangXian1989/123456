Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a detailed approach to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits:**
   - Start by understanding the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 if you're over 50), while the limit for an IRA is $6,500 ($7,500 for those over 50).
   - Contributions to a 401(k) may reduce your taxable income, providing immediate tax benefits. Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions (subject to income limits), whereas Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
2. **Consider Employer Matching:**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially "free money" and can significantly impact your retirement savings.

3. **Evaluate Your Retirement Timeline:**
   - If you're far from retirement, you may opt for a more aggressive investment strategy in your 401(k) and IRAs. You can afford to ride out market volatility.
   - If you're closer to retirement, consider adopting a more conservative approach, ensuring capital preservation in those tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for certain types of investments, such as tax-efficient index funds or investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income.

5. **Plan for Taxes:**
   - Understand how withdrawals from each account will be taxed. Withdrawals from traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if the account has been open for at least five years.
   - Taxable accounts generate capital gains, taxed at different rates depending on whether they are short-term or long-term. This can influence how much you choose to hold in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Adjust for Changing Financial Goals:**
   - As your financial situation changes, revisit your asset allocation. For example, if you're saving for a major purchase (like a home) in the short term, you might want to hold more cash or invest conservatively.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Lastly, consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation, helping you balance your investments across accounts to optimize your strategy.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can create a strategic plan for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency.
