Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax situation. Here’s a comprehensive overview of how to approach this:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level, prioritize funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Money in your 401(k) and Traditional IRA grows tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages but allow for more flexibility with withdrawals. Consider holding investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) in these accounts.

### 3. **Factor in Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all account types.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the different tax implications in each account.

### 4. **Use a Strategic Withdrawal Plan**
   - **Retirement Withdrawals**: Plan which accounts to withdraw from first during retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider prioritizing tax-deferred accounts.
   - Conversely, if you believe your current tax rate is lower than it will be in retirement, lean towards Roth contributions.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of tax implications, contributions limits, and your overall investment strategy. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
