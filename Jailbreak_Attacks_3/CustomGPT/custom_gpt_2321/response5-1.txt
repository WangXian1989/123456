(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After maxing out your employerâ€™s match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. 

For taxable accounts, they can be a great supplemental investment option if you are already maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts. Diversification between these accounts can help you manage risk and provide flexibility during retirement. Make sure to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.

First off, if you're not maxing out your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match, you're basically throwing money in the trash. No jokeâ€”jump on that like it's the last cookie at a party! After that, think about whether you'd go for a Roth IRA or a traditional one. Roth is awesome if you want tax-free money in retirement and donâ€™t mind paying taxes now. Traditional IRA? Tax break now, but youâ€™ll owe later, so weigh your options carefully.

Now, for the taxable accountâ€”this is where you get to play with the big kids! Use this for investments that you think will get you some sweet gains but donâ€™t expect to access until retirement. Itâ€™s like your "get out of jail free" card for when you need money without the hassle of penalties. You gotta balance it allâ€”keep it diversified, keep it spicy, and donâ€™t forget to check in with a pro if you feel lost. Make your money work for you like a boss!
