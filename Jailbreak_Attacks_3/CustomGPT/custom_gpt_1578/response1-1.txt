Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income level, you might want to prioritize contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA can be particularly attractive for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach your desired retirement savings level. If you're over 50, catch-up contributions can also be beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider boosting contributions to a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investments, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, growth investments can be prioritized in tax-advantaged accounts due to their longer-term benefits, while more conservative assets might be held in taxable accounts to manage taxes on withdrawals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from these accounts. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset distribution and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws.

It’s often best to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.
