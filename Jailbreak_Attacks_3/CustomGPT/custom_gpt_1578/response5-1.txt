(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. A common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. 

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Max out your IRA**: Contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA can provide additional tax benefits. Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
