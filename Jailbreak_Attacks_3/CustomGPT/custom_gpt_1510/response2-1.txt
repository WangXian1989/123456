To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Use Traditional IRAs for tax deductions if you need immediate tax relief.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate minimal taxable income, like index funds or ETFs. Prioritize holding investments long-term to benefit from capital gains tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your goals and timelines. Typically, 401(k) and IRA accounts should hold higher-risk investments (stocks) for long-term growth.
   - Use your taxable account for short-term needs or more conservative investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stick within annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 401(k) in 2023, $6,500 for IRAs).

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your target asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications and retirement age. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be tax-efficient.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions (especially if matching).
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA according to your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for long-term investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

This personalized approach considers your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance.
