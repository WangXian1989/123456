To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) first to take advantage of any employer match and defer taxes on your contributions and gains.
   - **IRA**: Once you maximize your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs are advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: 
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like municipal bonds or index funds, which may incur lower taxes.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust contributions based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
