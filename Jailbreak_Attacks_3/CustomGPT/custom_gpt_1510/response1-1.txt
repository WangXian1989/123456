Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any available match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Your Situation**: If your employer offers a Roth option, consider contributing to that if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax bracket vs. expected retirement bracket. Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Keep within the allowed limits, and consider contributing up to the maximum.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for shorter-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider municipal bonds, index funds, or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).

### Adjustments:
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on taxable accounts and tax implications of withdrawals from retirement accounts.
