To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess your investment goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use this information to allocate assets (stocks, bonds) appropriately across all accounts.

3. **Utilize taxable accounts wisely**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Rebalance periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

5. **Consider withdrawal strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, keeping tax implications in mind.

By focusing on tax efficiency and aligning your investments with your long-term goals, you can create a balanced portfolio across all account types.
