When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s free money!
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate long-term capital gains (e.g., ETFs, stocks) to minimize taxes.
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) here for tax-deferred growth. 

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and aware of your overall financial picture, you can effectively manage your distributions.
