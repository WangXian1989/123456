The distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly impact your growth over time.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit if it’s advantageous.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings beyond your tax-advantaged accounts can go into taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility for withdrawals, but you’ll need to consider capital gains taxes on any investment profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, develop a strategy for withdrawals. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k)), and lastly tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to minimize tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
