To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts can be beneficial.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how much risk you're willing to take. Generally, the longer your time horizon, the more you can afford to invest in higher-risk (higher potential return) assets like equities.
   - **Investment Mix:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth investments (like stocks) because the compounding growth grows tax-free or tax-deferred. Hold more conservative, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Create a diversified portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk and optimize returns. This may involve varying the percentage of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account based on your overall financial strategy.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level over time.

### 4. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** When it comes time to withdraw funds, consider tax implications. Taxable accounts may be the first source of withdrawals to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** Be mindful of RMDs from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs when you reach age 73, as they can impact your overall tax situation.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money effectively requires a combination of maximizing tax benefits, aligning with your risk tolerance and goals, and considering tax implications for both contributions and withdrawals. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
