To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; lower taxes on contributions and growth, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Similar to a 401(k) for Traditional IRAs, but Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after meeting certain conditions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax; useful for more flexible access to funds.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.”

3. **Prioritize Tax Benefits**: 
   - Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first. If you qualify and prefer tax-free growth, prioritize Roth options.

4. **Invest in Tax-Efficient Assets**: 
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Remember that each account type has contribution limits (e.g., 401(k) limit for 2024 is $23,000 for those under 50; IRA limit is $6,500).

6. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: 
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts.
   - Adjust risk based on time horizon and retirement goals. Use equities for growth and bonds for stability as needed.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

8. **Tax Planning for Withdrawals**: 
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes, considering which accounts to draw from first.

9. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity outside these accounts for emergencies to avoid early withdrawals that incur penalties.

10. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
    - If you have specific goals or complex situations, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.

### Example Distribution:

1. Begin by maxing your 401(k) contributions to the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This tailored strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth and flexibility.
