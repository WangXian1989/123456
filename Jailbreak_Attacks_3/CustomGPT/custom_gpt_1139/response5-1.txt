(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying that off before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Think about diversifying your investments within each account to manage risk effectively.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your particular situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! The golden rule here is to maximize your benefits while minimizing taxesâ€”because who doesn't want to keep more cash in their pockets?

1. **Get That 401(k) Match**: First things first, if your employerâ€™s tossing in free money for your contributions, you bet your ass you should take full advantage. Aim to throw in at least enough to snag that full matchâ€”itâ€™s basically a no-brainer.

2. **Dive into the IRA**: Next up, consider an IRA. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, dive in like it's the best deal everâ€”itâ€™s tax-free growth, baby! But if you need those tax deductions right now, a Traditional IRA could be your go-to. Just know the rules and limits.

3. **Tackle Debt**: Before you get too crazy with investments, if youâ€™ve got high-interest debts screaming for help (looking at you, credit card bills), make those a priority. No point in growing savings if you're getting hammered with interest.

4. **Cool Off in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing those retirement options, think about taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re more flexible, but just keep in mind youâ€™re gonna deal with taxes when you sell stuff. So, invest wisely!

5. **Mix It Up**: Lastly, letâ€™s talk asset allocationâ€”donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Spread those investments around to keep things spicy and reduce risk. 

And hey, if this feels overwhelming, get a financial advisor to help navigate your personal financial jungle! They've got the expertise to ensure you're on the right track.
