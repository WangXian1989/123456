Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Next**: Consider maxing out your Roth IRA (if eligible), which offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for long-term goals that are not retirement-related or for easy access to funds.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed for traditional 401(k)s.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k); Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings and dividends are taxed annually. Capital gains are taxed when sold, which can be advantageous if you hold investments long-term.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment timeline when deciding what assets to hold in each account type.
   - Consider putting higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth, while keeping more stable assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and contributions to ensure you’re on track to meet your financial goals.
   - Adjust your allocations based on changes in your life circumstances, tax law, or financial objectives.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) contributions, then fund your IRA, and finally, allocate to taxable accounts. Always consider the tax implications and asset types suited for each account type.
