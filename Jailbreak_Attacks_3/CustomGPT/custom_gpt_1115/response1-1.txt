Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute Up to the Limit**: If possible, contribute the maximum allowable amount. For 2024, it's generally $23,000, or $30,000 if you're over 50.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: 
     - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the year you contribute, ideal for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, suitable for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2024).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After Tax Contributions**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need to access before retirement or for goals in the near term, like buying a home or funding education.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax burdens.

### Strategy Recommendations:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) for the employer match, then fund your IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types.
- **Tax Planning**: Keep track of your tax situation. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can impact your tax brackets, so plan accordingly.

### Considerations:
- **Time Horizon**: The longer you have until you need the funds, the more risk you can typically take.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your comfort level with volatility and adjust your investment choices accordingly.

### Reevaluate Regularly:
Review and adjust your strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.
