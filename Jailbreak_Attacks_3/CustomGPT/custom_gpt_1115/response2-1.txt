Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of strategies to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)** 
- **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions (up to $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
- **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered.
- **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Types**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) may be beneficial. Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.
- **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions (up to $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if 50 or older).
- **Tax Strategy**: Consider using the traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth and a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Use for goals outside retirement, such as buying a home or travel.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Diversification**: Consider a more aggressive portfolio since taxes are due on taxable gains.

### **General Allocation Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid cash before investing aggressively.
2. **Tax Bracket Considerations**: Balance contributions based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
3. **Investment Goals**: Allocate funds based on the time horizon—long-term goals can take on more risk.
4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### **Example Distribution Plan**
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out Roth IRA if eligible, otherwise contribute to a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional funds based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
