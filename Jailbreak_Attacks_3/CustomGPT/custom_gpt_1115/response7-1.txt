Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your taxes and investment growth. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. These are ideal for high-income years.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are ideal for shorter-term goals, as they provide flexibility with withdrawals and the potential for lower capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all account types. For instance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts for tax-free income.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Revisit your allocation periodically to ensure you're aligned with your goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach that considers your current and future tax situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals will likely yield the best results. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.
