Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**:
     - Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up).
   - Focus on traditional options if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, or consider Roth options if you think your tax rate will increase.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals or if you want more liquidity.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diverse across all accounts to reduce risk. Different accounts may have different investment strategies depending on their tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice tailored to your specific situation for personalized strategies.
