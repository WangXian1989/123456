When determining how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, which reflect common financial planning principles:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Aim to max out contributions to your IRA, taking into account your eligibility for tax deductions or tax-free growth depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This makes them ideal for long-term retirement savings if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not offer tax-deferral benefits, but they allow for more flexibility. Consider holding assets that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts. Consider placing high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since these accounts provide liquidity. Reserve retirement accounts for long-term growth.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) first, followed by IRAs).
- Maximize growth in these accounts before focusing on taxable accounts.
- Maintain an appropriate asset allocation strategy to align with your financial goals.

This approach will help optimize your investments for tax efficiency while addressing both short-term and long-term financial objectives. If you have a particular scenario or detailed financial goals, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
