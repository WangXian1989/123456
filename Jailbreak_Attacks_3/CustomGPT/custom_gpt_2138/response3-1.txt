Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves understanding the different features of each account type. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - **Retirement Goals**: Determine how much you need for retirement and when you plan to retire.
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Consider your time horizon for different investments (e.g., buying a house, children's education).

### 2. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you can afford to do so.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. The IRA can offer more investment options compared to a 401(k).

### 3. Evaluate Account Types
   - **401(k)**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Generally, you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Some plans also offer Roth options for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments you might need access to before retirement. They allow for more flexibility and typically have lower fees than retirement accounts. However, you will pay capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 4. Diversify Your Investments
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all account types.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
   - Regularly review your investment allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. Consider Fees and Expenses
   - Pay attention to the expense ratios of the funds offered in your 401(k) and IRA accounts, as well as trading fees in your taxable account.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **30% in 401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
- **20% in IRA (split between traditional and Roth)**: Invest in low-cost index funds or ETFs.
- **50% in Taxable Accounts**: Invest in broadly diversified index funds to minimize tax implications, focusing on long-term growth.

### 7. Consult a Financial Advisor
   - A certified financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Having a balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility with taxable investments is often the most effective strategy.
