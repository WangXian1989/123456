When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your overall financial goals, current and future tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you strategize your distributions:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If you have a 401(k) plan at work with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth like a 401(k), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Decide based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are taxed on any realized gains, dividends, and interest, so consider using them for investments that are more tax-efficient.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Generally, you might want to have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

4. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have adequate liquid funds outside of these accounts to cover emergencies. This is critical as retirement accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. It can help manage tax brackets and minimize overall taxes.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Investment needs change over time due to life events, market conditions, and changes in financial goals, so it's crucial to periodically reassess your asset allocation.

Mixing these strategies can maximize your retirement savings and ensure you are prepared for future financial needs. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance specific to your financial situation.
