To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, which can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Determine Contributions Based on Goals**
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA after securing the employer match.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for savings that you may need access to before retirement or for investing without the constraints of retirement accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Consider placing investments with high turnover or high dividend yields in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid, less volatile investments, or for investments you plan to hold for shorter periods.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across all account types. Align your investments with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly assess your asset distribution and make adjustments as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
Establish a balanced approach to fund allocation, ensuring that you maximize benefits from tax-advantaged accounts while keeping flexibility with your taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor strategies to your specific circumstance.
