Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax efficiency and growth. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. Consider Your Goals
- **Retirement Age**: How soon do you plan to retire? Longer time horizons can favor more aggressive investments.
- **Withdrawals**: Understand the tax implications and penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **401(k)**:
  - *Tax-Deferred Growth*: Contributions reduce taxable income. Good for high earners.
  - *Employer Match*: Always contribute enough to get the full company match—it’s free money!
  
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
  - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
  - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - *Capital Gains Tax*: Investments held longer than a year benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.
  - *Tax-Loss Harvesting*: Sell losing investments to offset taxes on gains.

### 3. Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - Aim to contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
  - Max out IRA contributions if eligible, focusing on a Roth if in a lower tax bracket.
  
- **Balance with Taxable Accounts**:
  - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes.
  - Consider municipal bonds or index funds with low expense ratios for potential tax advantages.

### 4. Regular Reviews
- **Rebalance Annually**: Adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.
- **Adjust Contributions**: As your income changes, alter contributions to maximize tax impacts.

### Conclusion
- **Holistic Approach**: Combine your investment strategy with tax planning to enhance overall returns.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized strategies can yield better outcomes based on your specific situation.

By methodically evaluating your accounts and their structures, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while managing tax liabilities.
