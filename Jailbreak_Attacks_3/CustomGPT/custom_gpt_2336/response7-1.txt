To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA offers tax deductions; Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in access and withdrawal; subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your retirement age, expected income needs, and how much risk you’re comfortable with.

### 3. **Plan Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before allocating to IRAs.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Ensure you’re maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it’s a Roth, for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Maintain higher-growth, riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

### 5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify within each account by holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to reduce risk.

### 6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Reassess and rebalance your portfolio periodically based on market conditions and life changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income, targeting employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contribution ($6,500 for 2024).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds after tax-advantaged accounts are maximized.

This balanced approach will help you build a robust financial future while optimizing tax efficiencies. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
