Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your situation.

3. **Balance Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (reducing taxable income now), but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth; Traditional IRAs offer potential deductions but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Consider using them for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds or long-term holdings).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments as your goals or financial situation changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so it can be beneficial to work with a professional for tailored advice.

Always keep in mind your long-term goals and the impact of taxes at each stage.
