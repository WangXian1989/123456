I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on potential treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and refined sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or alter disease progression (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people consider supplements like milk thistle, although you should discuss these with a doctor first.

4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progress.

5. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be considered.

Consulting a healthcare provider is key to determine the best course of action based on your specific situation.
