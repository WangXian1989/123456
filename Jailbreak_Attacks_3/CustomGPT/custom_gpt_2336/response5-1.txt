Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains or income. This is ideal for longer-term investment horizons.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep investments that generate higher ordinary income (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and hold assets with lower tax implications (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about your current and future tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
