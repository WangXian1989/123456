To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The 2023 contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Long-Term Growth**: Invest in low-turnover index funds or ETFs that generate qualified dividends to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) for Higher Income Investments**: Place higher-growth investments in your 401(k) since the tax burden is deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRAs for Tax-Free Growth**: Use Roth IRAs for investments you expect to generate significant growth over time since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts if needed.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across asset classes in all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

7. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Your current and expected future tax bracket will influence how you allocate funds. If you expect to be in a higher bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth funds now.

8. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate cash reserve for emergencies to avoid tapping into your investments early.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
