To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for immediate tax benefits. Many employers offer matching contributionsâ€”take full advantage of this.
   - **IRA**: Utilize this account for tax-deferred growth. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain conditions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Reserve these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

2. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Aggressive Growth (Younger Investors)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your taxable account for higher returns and capital gains.
   - **Balanced Approach (Mid-Career)**: Distribute more into your 401(k) and IRA, maintaining a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts.
   - **Conservative (Near Retirement)**: Shift to more stable investments in your tax-advantaged accounts while keeping some liquidity in taxable accounts for unexpected needs.

3. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure you consistently invest across all accounts, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

4. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be mindful of the fees associated with each account. Select low-cost index funds or ETFs in your 401(k) and IRA to enhance returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments to maintain your desired risk tolerance and investment goals.

Assess your financial situation and goals to determine the best approach tailored to your needs.
