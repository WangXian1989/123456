Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Make contributions up to the annual limit for tax benefits.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of funds that match your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Tax Strategy**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Withdrawals**: Use for short-term goals or emergencies, since they are not bound by retirement account penalties.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or ETFs for lower tax implications. Focus on investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA to potentially benefit from tax advantages.
3. Return to your 401(k) and max out contributions.
4. Invest any additional savings in a taxable account.

### Consider Your Goals:
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can afford more risk in retirement accounts; shorter-term needs may require more liquid, conservative options.
- **Tax Considerations**: Strategically choose where to place assets based on expected tax implications.

### Regular Review:
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

### Professional Guidance:
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
