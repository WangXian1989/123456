Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider your investment options, fees, and your risk tolerance. Higher growth assets might be suitable if you're years away from retirement.

2. **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax strategy. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in taxable accounts if you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. They offer flexibility since you can access the funds without penalties, but keep an eye on the tax implications of dividends and capital gains.

In general, the priority of contributions is typically 401(k) (up to the match), then IRA, and then taxable accounts. Adjust according to your situation, and consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
