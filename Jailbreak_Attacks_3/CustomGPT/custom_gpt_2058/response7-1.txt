When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max out Employer Match on 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and has an immediate return on investment.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on whether itâ€™s a Roth or a traditional IRA, this will have different tax implications in the short and long term.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Up to Max Contribution:** If you can afford to, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Investment Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to a taxable investment account. This account offers more flexibility but consider the tax implications of capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Accordingly:** Regularly review your investments and rebalance as needed to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
