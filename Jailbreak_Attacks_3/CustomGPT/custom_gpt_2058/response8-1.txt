Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, consider contributing enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. The 401(k) contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.

2. **Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) up to the match, you can contribute to an IRA. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA allows your investments to grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are also tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable brokerage accounts. This allows for greater flexibility in terms of access to your funds and investment choices, but you'll be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you're in a high tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) may be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maxing out Roth contributions.

5. **Diversification of Investments:** Regardless of account type, ensure your investment portfolio is diversified among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, investment performance, and life circumstances.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your unique situation.
