Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that can greatly impact your overall retirement and tax strategy. Here are some considerations for optimizing your asset allocation:

1. **Prioritize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts may be beneficial for short-term financial goals or for holding investments that generate lower taxable income (like qualified dividends).
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Allocate investments with higher growth potential (such as stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

3. **Consider Investment Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds that you may need in the next few years in more liquid, accessible accounts.
   - **Long-Term Gains:** Place higher-risk investments in accounts that are meant for long-term growth, allowing them to weather market fluctuations.

4. **Review and Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Be sure to periodically reassess your allocations to ensure they still align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

By strategically prioritizing contributions and understanding the implications of each account type, you can optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency.
