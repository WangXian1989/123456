To optimize the distribution of your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

### 2. **Strategic Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Place high-growth assets like stocks to enjoy tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Use a mix of stocks and bonds; Roth IRAs are advantageous for high-growth assets due to tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you are younger with a longer time until retirement, lean more heavily into equities in all accounts, particularly the 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift toward safer investments like bonds, especially in your taxable accounts, to reduce risk.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor the performance and tax implications annually, adjusting your allocations based on changes in income, life events, or tax laws.

### 5. **Seek Professional Guidance**
   - If your financial situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively allocate your funds to maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities.
