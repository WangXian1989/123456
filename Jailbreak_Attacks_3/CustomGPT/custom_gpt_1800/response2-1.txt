Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high contribution limit and your employer matches, this is a solid option.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation best. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term, tax-deferred growth.
   - In your taxable accounts, invest in assets that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax. 

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, you might lean toward a Roth IRA.
   - If you anticipate a similar or higher tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies.

6. **Regularly Reassess and Rebalance**: Review your asset allocation periodically, especially as you get closer to retirement, to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
