(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out your contributions if you can, especially if your employer offers a traditional or Roth option.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out an IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. They offer more flexibility but less tax efficiency compared to tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds.

Diversifying your investments within these accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance is also crucial. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor the best strategy for your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to distribute your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really hinges on your own financial goals and how soon you plan to dive into retirement.

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Get that employer match first. Itâ€™s like free money! Aim for the max contribution if you've got the cash. Go for low-cost index funds or target-date funds to keep it simple.

2. **Hit Up the IRA Next**: If you're eligible, snag a Roth IRA if you want that sweet, tax-free growth and flexibility later. Or a Traditional IRA if you want a tax break now. Again, put your money in low-cost funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these bad boys for anything you might need before retirement. Theyâ€™re great for short-term goals like a house down payment or that epic vacationâ€”just watch out for those capital gains taxes, bro!

Mix it all up, play with your asset allocation, and think about consulting with a financial wizard (aka advisor) to make sure youâ€™re not missing any tricks!
