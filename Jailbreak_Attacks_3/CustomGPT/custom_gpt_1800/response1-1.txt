Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for higher contribution limits and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if you're eligible), or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Higher-earners might benefit from maximizing tax-deferred accounts to reduce taxable income.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be preferable.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep some money in taxable accounts for easier access and potential tax advantages on long-term capital gains.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Annually review and adjust your distribution strategy based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor advice to your specific circumstances and help optimize your tax strategy.

This might seem like a lot, but a strategic mix can help you grow your wealth more efficiently over time!
