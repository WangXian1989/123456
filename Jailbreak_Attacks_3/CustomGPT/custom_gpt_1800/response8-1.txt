Distributing your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider funding your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a high tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for tax-deductible contributions. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more heavily into stocks, while those nearing retirement might shift towards bonds or stable investments.

4. **Optimal Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Generally, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Stay Informed About Fees**: Be aware of the fees associated with each account. Certain 401(k) plans might have high fees that can eat into your returns, while IRAs often offer lower-cost investment options.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level based on market performance and your personal situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and goals.

It's crucial to align your strategy with your long-term goals and financial situation. Would you like to explore any of these strategies further?
