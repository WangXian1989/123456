Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions to this account up to the match limit.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income now.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts Last**: Only after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts should you invest in taxable accounts. These accounts don’t offer the same tax benefits but provide flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account, consider your investment strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.) and risk tolerance. Typically, you might want a more aggressive portfolio in your 401(k) and IRA since these are long-term investments.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your unique situation, working with a financial planner can be beneficial.

### Summary
1. Max out 401(k) contributions (especially for employer match).
2. Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth).
3. Invest in taxable accounts as a secondary option.
4. Review and rebalance investments regularly.
