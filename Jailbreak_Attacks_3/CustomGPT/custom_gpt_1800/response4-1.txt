When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions, reducing taxable income during your working years. Important for high earners.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional vs. Roth), contributions affect taxes differently. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These will be subject to capital gains tax on earnings, making them less ideal for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts for holding investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-producing assets in taxable accounts to manage taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Ensure that your taxable account has enough liquidity for short-term needs while maximizing growth in your retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Future Tax Planning**: 
   - Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket, Roth accounts might be beneficial.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your individual situation and goals.
