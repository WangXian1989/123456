Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. The choice depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.

### 2. Understand Withdrawal Rules
   - **Tax Implications:** Distributions from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA and taxable accounts have different tax implications. Consider your future tax situation when determining how much to keep in each account.
   - **Age Considerations:** Keep in mind the age of 59Â½ for penalty-free withdrawals and other rules surrounding retirement accounts.

### 3. Balance for Flexibility and Growth
   - **Taxable Accounts:** While these are less tax-efficient, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. This can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals before retirement.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes having a mix of asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance.

### Summary Recommendations
- **Prioritize employer contributions in the 401(k).**
- **Contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for immediate liquidity needs or specific goals.**
