When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the purpose and benefits of each account type, as well as your financial goals and tax implications. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. In 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (total $30,000 if you’re 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). These accounts offer significant tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk. Consider using target-date funds for a set-it-and-forget-it strategy.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize the tax burden on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Adjust Based on Income**: Be mindful of your current income and expected future tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals later.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

By structuring your contributions in this way, you can optimize your savings and potentially achieve greater financial stability in the long run.
