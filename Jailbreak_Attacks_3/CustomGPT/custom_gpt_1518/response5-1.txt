(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first, as it's essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

Always assess your risk tolerance, investment goals, and consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The ultimate strategy for dividing your cash among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like crafting the perfect smoothieâ€”balance is key! 

1. **Hit That 401(k) Like Itâ€™s Free Pizza:** First off, if your company matches contributions, go for the gusto! Itâ€™s money for nothing. Throw in some cash until you hit that max match. Youâ€™ll kick yourself later if you don't.

2. **IRA Magic:** Next, weigh the Traditional vs. Roth IRA based on your tax situation. If you expect your tax bracket to rise, the Roth is your friend. If you want the tax break now, go Traditional. Aim for the maximum contribution!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once your tax-advantaged accounts are looking good, start slinging money into taxable accounts. They come with more risk of taxes but provide flexibility when you want to access your cash without penalties.

In short, boost the retirement accounts first, then splurge on those taxable accounts. And hey, donâ€™t forget to reassess as you go along. Happy investing! ðŸš€ðŸ’¸
