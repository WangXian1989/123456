Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full company match if available.
   - **Tax-deferred growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free). A traditional IRA may be better if you want tax deductions now.
   - **Contribution limits**: Be aware of annual limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023, plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are not subject to early withdrawal penalties, providing more liquidity for short-term goals.
   - **Tax treatment**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for profit. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Prioritize contributions**: Start with your 401(k) enough to get the match, then maximize your IRA. After that, contribute additional funds to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your goals and immediate liquidity needs.
- **Diversify investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
- **Regularly review your allocation**: Rebalance your portfolio as needed to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Consulting with a financial advisor is a good idea for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
