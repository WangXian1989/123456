Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: 401(k) and IRAs grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Prioritize these for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. They’re ideal for short-term goals or situations where you might need access to funds.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Adjusting for Withdrawals**:
   - When you approach retirement, focus on tax-efficient withdrawal strategies, considering the order of accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on life changes or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
