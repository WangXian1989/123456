To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically better for tax-deferred growth. Consider higher-risk investments (stocks) in this account for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: If it’s a Roth IRA, focus on investments you’ll hold long-term, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more liquid investments. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk while aiming for growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement carefully. Start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, then consider tapping into IRAs or 401(k)s as needed based on tax implications.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix in light of market changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help assess your specific financial situation and provide personalized advice.

By taking these steps, you can optimize your investment allocations across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
