Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money. Then, aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA next, based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Funds in your 401(k) and IRA should generally be invested in a diversified portfolio with a higher risk tolerance since they are for retirement.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for any savings you might need access to within the next few years. This can include bonds, stocks, or even high-yield savings accounts.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient ones (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts. This helps minimize taxes on your investments.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and to reflect any changes in your financial situation or goals.

### Conclusion
This structure typically helps you maximize growth potential while reducing your overall tax burden. However, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your particular situation.
