To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed (for 2024, it's $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older). Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: If you haven't maxed out your 401(k) or if you're eligible for a Roth IRA (income limits apply), consider contributing here as well. For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable account. This is especially important for short- to medium-term goals, as it allows more liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use **tax-efficient investments** in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth accounts).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial goals and tax situation.

This balanced approach will help optimize your tax benefits while working toward your retirement goals.
