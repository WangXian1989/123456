Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Focus on tax-efficient investments.

### 4. **Investment Horizon:**
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) as they typically offer better growth potential due to tax benefits.
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for flexibility, but be mindful of the tax implications on gains.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep in mind that you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations and rebalance as needed to align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
A common approach is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, then fund your IRA to the max, and finally allocate any excess savings to a taxable account. This structure helps maximize growth while managing tax exposure based on your unique situation. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
