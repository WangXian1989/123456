1. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or medications to manage symptoms.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Limiting or avoiding alcohol is vital for liver recovery.
   - **Weight Management:** Achieving a healthy weight can help reduce liver fat.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up:** Regular check-ups with a specialist to monitor liver function tests and adjust treatments as needed.

4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical interventions might be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant:** In advanced liver disease cases, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
