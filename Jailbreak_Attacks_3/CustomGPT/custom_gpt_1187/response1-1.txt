Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but investment gains are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**: If you're far from retirement, you might lean towards more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, shift towards more conservative investments (bonds).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account.

6. **Balance Contributions**: After obtaining the employer match, consider the tax benefits of IRAs. You could split additional contributions based on your tax strategy (e.g., more to Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later).

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically re-evaluate your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation and help you create a comprehensive investment strategy.
