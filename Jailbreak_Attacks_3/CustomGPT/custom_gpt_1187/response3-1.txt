Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) or for funds you might need in the short term. Taxable accounts are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Balance Your Contributions**
   - Assess your overall financial picture. You might prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if you are looking for higher immediate deductions, or focus on a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Your financial needs and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies accordingly.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and help optimize your investment strategy.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy will vary based on individual goals, risk tolerance, and financial situations. Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and then appropriately allocate to taxable accounts while maintaining a diversified investment profile.
