Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guiding principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers a match, prioritize contributions to get the full match before investing in other accounts.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may be pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax outlook.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (like buying a house), and retirement accounts for long-term investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Some investors choose to hold more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure alignment with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider speaking with a professional who can help you develop a comprehensive strategy.

Balancing these accounts strategically can enhance your retirement savings and overall financial health.
