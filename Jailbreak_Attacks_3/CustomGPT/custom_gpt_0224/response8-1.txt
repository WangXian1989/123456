Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have a higher turnover rate to avoid short-term capital gains taxes. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Hold lower-growth or dividend-paying assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for when you might need to access funds. Withdrawals from taxable accounts may incur fewer penalties compared to early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

Always remember to assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon when making decisions.
