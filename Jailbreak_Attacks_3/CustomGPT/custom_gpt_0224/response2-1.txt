Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key factors:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Pre-tax or Roth options available.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth). Tax advantages vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; best for short-term goals or flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth without immediate taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Employer Match**
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Short-term goals: Favor taxable accounts for easier access.
   - Long-term goals: Focus on maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### 6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

### **Sample Allocation Strategy**
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of pre-tax income (enough to get the employer match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining savings based on your cash flow and financial goals.

### **Resources**
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation!

By carefully considering these elements, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your funds across these accounts.
