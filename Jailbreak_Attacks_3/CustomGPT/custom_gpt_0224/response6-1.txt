Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you make decisions:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now, but distributions will be taxed later.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are not tax-deductible, but they offer flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Funds needed in the short term may be better in taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for retirement savings to maximize growth.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged First**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before considering taxable accounts for tax deferral benefits.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer tax on capital gains.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Flexibility**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account separate from these investment accounts.
   - Consider keeping some liquidity in taxable accounts for unforeseen expenses.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and adjust contributions based on changing financial goals and market conditions.
