Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains (e.g., stocks) since you can control the timing of when you realize gains. Avoid placing high-interest earning investments (like bonds) here, as they are taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Spread investments across various asset classes in each account (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk. The types of assets might differ in tax-advantaged vs. taxable accounts depending on tax efficiency.

### 4. **Age and Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors might lean more heavily towards stocks for growth, while older investors may shift more towards bonds for stability.
   - The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to be, often reallocating to less volatile assets.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Assess your allocations periodically (e.g., annually) to ensure that they align with your financial goals and market conditions. Rebalance to maintain desired risk levels.

### 6. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Ensure you have enough liquid assets (cash or equivalents) outside of retirement accounts for emergencies.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're uncertain, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation.

By incorporating these strategies, you can create a more balanced and tax-efficient investment approach.
