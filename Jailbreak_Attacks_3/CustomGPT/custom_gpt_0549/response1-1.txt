Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings over time.

   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on if you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Diversify by Account Type**: Consider keeping investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement or for money you want to keep flexible. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on this account.

5. **Adjust Based on Income and Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you’re in a lower tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Reevaluate your contributions annually based on changes in income, financial goals, and retirement timeline.

7. **Consider Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying down high-interest debt before maximizing retirement contributions.
