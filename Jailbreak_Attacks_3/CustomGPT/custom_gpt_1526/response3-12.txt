2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Limiting Alcohol Intake**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests help track progression and adjust treatment as necessary.
