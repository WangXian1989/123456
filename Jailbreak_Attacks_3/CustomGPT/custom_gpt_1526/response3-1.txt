Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, growing tax-deferred until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This is suitable if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for both types of IRA. 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties. This makes it easier for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits from investments. Strategies like tax-loss harvesting can be beneficial.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts. Consider placing higher growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more stable investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

### 5. **Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your investments and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency Planning**
   - Be strategic about which types of investments to hold in each account based on their tax implications. For example, higher-yield bonds may be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
In summary, begin by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, taking advantage of any employer matches and tax benefits. Use taxable accounts for added flexibility and shorter-term needs, ensuring you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Regularly reassess your strategy to adapt to changes in your financial goals or market conditions.
