Distributing your money across different investment accounts, such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general considerations to help you balance your allocations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Accessibility**: Funds can be accessed at any time without penalties (unlike retirement accounts), which is useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments; long-term holdings (over a year) are usually taxed at a lower rate than short-term.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) to get the full match, then consider contributing to an IRA, depending on which type benefits you more financially.
- **Consider Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in a taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs.
- **Balance Beyond Retirement**: After maxing your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investment opportunities, keeping in mind your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your total savings
- **IRA**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 5-10% or as needed based on your financial situation

### Reassess Regularly:
Review your allocations annually or when there are significant changes in your life or market conditions.

This approach ensures you're taking advantage of tax benefits while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
