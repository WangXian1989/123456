Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income and tax bracket.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Try to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax advantages and compound growth. The annual contribution limits vary, so check the current limits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to spread risk and enhance potential returns.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may be more tax-efficient, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

This strategy can help optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
