Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches, prioritize this. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner, as they allow for more liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - Consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where you can take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Consistently contribute to all accounts. Automate where possible to build your investment over time.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your allocations yearly to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
