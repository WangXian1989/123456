Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maxing out an IRA contribution (either traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction.

3. **Fill Up Your 401(k):** After maximizing your match, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocation based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
