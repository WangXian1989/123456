Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contributions to IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

### 3. **401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out your employer match, contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. This helps reduce your taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments beyond retirement accounts. This offers flexibility in withdrawals and can be beneficial for short-term goals. 

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically, considering market changes and your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (e.g., bonds) in tax-deferred accounts, and keep investments with favorable capital gains treatment (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### Summary
- **First:** Maximize 401(k) match.
- **Second:** Contribute to IRA.
- **Third:** Continue funding 401(k) to the limit.
- **Finally:** Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity.
