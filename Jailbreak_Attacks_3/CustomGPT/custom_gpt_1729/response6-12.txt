I'm not a medical professional, but it's crucial to see a healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Here are some general approaches that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:  
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Reducing alcohol intake, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and avoiding processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:  
   - Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**:  
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Specialized Treatments**:  
   - For specific conditions, treatments like antiviral medications (for viral hepatitis) or corticosteroids (for autoimmune liver diseases) may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**:  
   - In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
