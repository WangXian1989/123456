The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out tax-advantaged Accounts**: Next, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to the maximum contribution limit if you qualify. This can help you reduce your taxable income (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA options, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals but be aware of capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. You might want to keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts due to different tax implications.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Understand how your current tax bracket might influence how you allocate funds, especially if you expect to be in a different tax bracket during retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations in response to changes in the market or your financial situation.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
