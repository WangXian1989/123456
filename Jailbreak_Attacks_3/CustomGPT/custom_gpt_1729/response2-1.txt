Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds here. Pay attention to capital gains taxes and consider tax-efficient investments.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Typically, these accounts are suited for long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds or other income-generating investments, as you will be taxed on those earnings.

### 4. **Age and Time Horizon:**
   - Younger investors might focus more on aggressive growth strategies in their retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

### 5. **Maintain Flexibility:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as 401(k) and IRA funds are usually less accessible without penalties.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Monitor your investments and adjust them periodically based on performance and changing goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - It may be beneficial to meet with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your individual circumstances.

By carefully balancing your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency.
