Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - **Max out employer match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts first**: After the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) before contributing more to the 401(k).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**  
   - **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Suitable for long-term growth. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Tax-free accounts** (Roth IRA): Ideal for growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Best for short- to mid-term goals. You pay capital gains tax only on realized gains.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**  
   - **Long-term**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement.
   - **Medium-term**: Utilize taxable accounts for purchases in the next 5-10 years.
   - **Short-term needs**: Keep funds accessible in a high-yield savings account or a money market fund.

### 4. **Diversification and Investment Strategy**  
   - Different accounts can hold different types of investments based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Review**  
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifting financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy  
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of income (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder up to your financial goals
