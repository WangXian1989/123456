Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Individual accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may reduce taxable income, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular brokerage accounts where investments are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Planning:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Taxable accounts provide flexibility for short-term needs.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize 401(k) matching contributions first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (up to the limit allowed).
   - Any additional funds can be allocated to your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Consider bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts, avoiding concentration in one account type.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust allocations periodically to reflect market performance and changing financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor strategies based on your specific situation, risk tolerance, and future plans.

By balancing these factors, you can optimize your financial growth while minimizing taxes and risks.
