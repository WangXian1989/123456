To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for assets expected to generate high taxable income (like bonds) to minimize immediate tax impact.
   - Hold investments that generate long-term capital gains (like stocks) in taxable accounts, as these may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals by considering which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts before tax-advantaged ones.

5. **Year-End Strategies**:
   - At the end of each tax year, assess your capital gains and losses and consider tax-loss harvesting in your taxable account to offset gains.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan based on your financial situation, goals, and market conditions can be beneficial.

Make adjustments as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.
