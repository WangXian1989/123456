Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After the match, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k). These contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After funding retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These can be more flexible, allowing withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold high-growth or taxable bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to limit tax impact.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings in accounts accessible for emergencies before heavily investing.

6. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Depending on your income level, certain strategies may yield better outcomes. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Adjust your distribution as your financial situation or tax law changes over time. Would you like more specific guidance on any of these options?
