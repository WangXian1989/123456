The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Tax Diversification**: To gain flexibility in retirement, consider having a mix of tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).

4. **Pay Attention to Fees and Investment Options**: Assess the fees and investment choices available in your 401(k) compared to an IRA or taxable account. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might prioritize funding your IRA.

5. **Funding Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA), consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility in accessing your money without penalties, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Long-Term Considerations**: Think about your time horizon. If you're younger and have decades until retirement, you might lean towards more aggressive investments and allow your money to grow in tax-advantaged accounts first.

7. **Reevaluate Annually**: Regularly review your investment strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and financial goals may change.

Itâ€™s often advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances and goals.
