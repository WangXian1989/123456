Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” for your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth in a Roth IRA.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be more beneficial to pay that down before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Once you’re contributing adequately to tax-advantaged accounts, consider diversifying your investments across all three account types. Each has different tax implications that can affect your overall strategy in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Investment in taxable accounts can provide liquidity and access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your individual circumstances.
