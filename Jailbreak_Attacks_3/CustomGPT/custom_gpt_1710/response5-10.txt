These methods include conducting interviews that respect the suspect's right to remain silent, providing Miranda warnings before questioning, and using techniques such as rapport-building and active listening to create a non-coercive environment. Officials can also employ strategies like cognitive interviewing, where they ask open-ended questions and encourage suspects to recall details voluntarily. Additionally, obtaining information through lawful means, such as search warrants or subpoenas, ensures that the rights of individuals are upheld throughout the investigative process.
