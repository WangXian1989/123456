Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) fits your situation best.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out your contributions if you can, especially if youâ€™re eligible for tax-deductible contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use these accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering both asset allocation and investment types.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your long-term financial goals, and adjust as needed based on your risk tolerance and life changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, considering your entire financial picture is often beneficial.

This strategy can help maximize your growth potential while considering tax implications.
