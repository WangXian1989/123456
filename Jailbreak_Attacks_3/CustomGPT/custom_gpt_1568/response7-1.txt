Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket now compared to retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you qualify, consider prioritizing this account for its tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA. If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial.

### 3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - Once youâ€™re contributing enough to get maximum employer match in your 401(k), continue maximizing contributions to your IRA. After that, consider additional contributions to the 401(k) if you still have room in your budget.

### 4. **Invest for Growth in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like certain bonds) or for more aggressive growth investments (potentially higher risk) that can benefit from long-term capital gains treatment.
   - Consider holding stocks in taxable accounts for long-term investment due to lower capital gains taxes after one year.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and yield-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly reassess your financial situation, goals, and market conditions to adjust your contributions and allocations as needed.

### Conclusion
To optimize your strategy, consider both your current financial situation and your expected future needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
