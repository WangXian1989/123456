Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Always aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer's match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred. Good if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Strategic Contributions:** Maximize contributions to these accounts if you're eligible, taking advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them suitable for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) First:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Fund IRA Next:** Choose between Traditional or Roth based on your future tax expectations.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on specific goals (like buying a home or travel).

### Monitoring and Adjusting:
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider personalized advice that takes into account your unique circumstances and investment goals.

This approach balances tax advantages with flexibility, helping you build wealth effectively across different account types.
