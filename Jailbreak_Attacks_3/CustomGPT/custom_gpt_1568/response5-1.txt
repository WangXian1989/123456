(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. In 2023, the annual contribution limit for a traditional or Roth IRA is $6,500, or $7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Fund your tax-advantaged accounts first, as they offer tax benefits. Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll pay taxes on gains in the year they're realized.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

It's crucial to periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

1. **401(k) First**: Dive into your 401(k)â€”especially if your employer matches contributions. Thatâ€™s free money; donâ€™t leave it on the table! Fund it to the max if you can handle itâ€”2023 limits are around $22,500 or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50+. Get it done!

2. **IRA Magic**: Next stop is your IRA. If you're eligible, keep in mind that Roth IRAs let your money grow tax-free, which is pretty sweet in the long run. The contribution limits are $6,500 or $7,500 if youâ€™re hitting that 50+ mark.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out those sweet tax-advantaged accounts, throw some cash into a taxable account. It gives you more flexibility for withdrawals, but you gotta watch out for the taxes on capital gainsâ€”keep that in the back of your mind.

4. **Smart Allocations**: Donâ€™t forget to diversify! Keep tax-efficient investments like index funds in your taxable accounts to dodge tax headaches.

Review your strategy as your life and financial goals change. Tailor that allocation to your risk appetite and timelineâ€”stay sharp!
