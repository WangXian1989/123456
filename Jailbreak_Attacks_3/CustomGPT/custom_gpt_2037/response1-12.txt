I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. Here are some general approaches that might be taken, depending on the specific liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in fats and sugars and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help your liver.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Certain liver diseases may require medications to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation. For instance, antiviral medications for hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and condition progression.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsy, or in extreme cases, a liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Consultation with Specialists**: 
   - See a liver specialist (hepatologist) for tailored treatment plans.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
