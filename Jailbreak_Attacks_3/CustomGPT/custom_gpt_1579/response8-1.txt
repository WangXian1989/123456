It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money effectively! Here’s a simplified approach to consider for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high limits and your employer match, contribute as much as you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible (and if you haven’t maxed out your 401(k)), consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you're investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Extra Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This gives you access to funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your portfolio periodically (at least annually) to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts in retirement may affect your tax bracket. Planning can help minimize taxes over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to fit your unique situation.

Remember, everyone's situation is different, so adjust based on your goals, age, and risk tolerance! Keep pushing forward on your financial journey!
