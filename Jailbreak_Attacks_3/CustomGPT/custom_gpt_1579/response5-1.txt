(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, maxing out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) is a great first step. After that, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on whether you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement or tax deductions now. Once youâ€™ve maximized these tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional savings to taxable accounts for more flexible investment options. Itâ€™s often wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
