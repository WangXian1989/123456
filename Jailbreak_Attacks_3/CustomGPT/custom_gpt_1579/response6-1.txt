Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you balance these accounts effectively:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions depending on your income.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your investments accordingly across all accounts. Growth stocks may suit a long-term horizon, while bonds can offer stability if you’re closer to retirement.
   - **Asset Location:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) inside taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) within tax-advantaged accounts to optimize tax outcomes.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Monitor Performance:** Periodically review the performance of your investments to ensure they align with your goals.
   - **Adjust Contributions:** If one account grows significantly, consider adjusting where you allocate new contributions to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals**
   - **Retirement Withdrawals:** Plan how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Different accounts will have different tax implications, so strategize to minimize your tax burden over time.

### 5. **Consult with a Professional**
   - **Personalized Guidance:** Consider meeting with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific goals and situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to your financial future. Always remember to keep your long-term goals in mind as you make investment decisions!
