Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a concise breakdown of how to approach it:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings. IRAs may offer tax deductions or tax-free growth depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Consider the tax impact. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, while gains in retirement accounts are tax-deferred or tax-free. 

4. **Investment Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your retirement timeline. Longer horizons often allow for higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some cash in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as funds in retirement accounts often have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and account types to manage risk and improve potential returns.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly reassess your allocations as financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws change.

By following these guidelines, you can structure your investment strategy to optimize growth while being mindful of your tax situation and liquidity needs.
