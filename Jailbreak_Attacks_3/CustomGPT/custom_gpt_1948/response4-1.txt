Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your contributions to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs make this a crucial step.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility but remember they are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market performance.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of your investments in taxable accounts. Favoring tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can minimize tax liabilities.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
