When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Tailor your asset allocation based on your goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and your time horizon. For longer-term goals, you might choose a more aggressive portfolio.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investment allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to spread risk. This is crucial for all account types.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you'll withdraw funds from each account type to minimize taxes and sustain income.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation, helping you navigate the complexities of tax implications and investment choices.

By integrating these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
