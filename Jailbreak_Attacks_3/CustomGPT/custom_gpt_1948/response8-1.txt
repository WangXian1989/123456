To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for the maximum allowed contribution if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Depending on your income, prioritize contributions to these accounts after maximizing your 401(k) match.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - Within these accounts, choose low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize fees. Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement. Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to ensure you're consistently investing and taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial planner to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

This approach helps you maximize growth while managing risk and tax implications. Always consider your individual circumstances when making investment decisions.
