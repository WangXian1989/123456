Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Some plans offer a Roth option for after-tax contributions.
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Planning**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and consider using a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer easier access to funds without penalties, making them ideal for short- to mid-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs.

### **Strategy Suggestions**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any available match.
- **Diversify Contributions**: If you have excess funds after the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your tax bracket.
- **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

### **Follow-Up Questions**
- What are your short-term versus long-term financial goals?
- Do you anticipate any significant changes in your income or expenses in the near future?
