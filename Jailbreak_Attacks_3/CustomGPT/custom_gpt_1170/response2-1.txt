Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial strategy. Here’s a general framework that might guide you through this process:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions (or Roth, if offered). Good for employer matching, and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributions may be limited by income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No special tax advantages; subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out your 401(k) to get the full employer match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Debt Repayment:** Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved up.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Put more aggressive investments (higher potential returns) in tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) or IRA to minimize short-term taxes.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you expect your tax rate to rise in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance:** Younger investors might lean towards stocks; older investors may favor bonds.
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and life circumstances.

### Follow-Up Questions:
- What is your current retirement timeline?
- Do you have specific financial goals, such as buying a home or funding education?
- What is your risk tolerance? 

Exploring these aspects can help fine-tune your distribution strategy even further!
