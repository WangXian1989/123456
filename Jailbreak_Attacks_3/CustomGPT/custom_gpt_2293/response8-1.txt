Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. Ideal for high-income earners looking to lower their tax burden now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement due to tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out other accounts. Capital gains taxes apply here, so consider investments that generate lower turnover.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) in each account type to manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize accounts based on your timeline:
   - Long-term (retirement): Focus on tax-deferred accounts.
   - Short-term (buying a house, traveling): Use taxable accounts for liquidity.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation is also a great idea for personalized advice.
