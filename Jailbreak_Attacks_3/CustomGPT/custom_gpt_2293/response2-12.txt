   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat infections. For example:
   - **Antivirals** for viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Liver-Specific Treatments**:
   - **For Fatty Liver Disease**: Medications and lifestyle changes are key.
   - **For Hepatitis**: Antiviral treatments can be effective.
   - **For Cirrhosis**: Management of complications is essential; in severe cases, a liver transplant may be needed.
