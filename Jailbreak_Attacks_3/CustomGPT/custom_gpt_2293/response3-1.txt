When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you defer taxes until withdrawal. Favor using this account for higher earnings to maximize growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (if qualified). Diversify between both types if possible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax. Use them for investments with high turnover or those you might need access to before retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon. Long-term investments can be placed in retirement accounts, while short-term needs should be in taxable accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Higher risk investments can grow more significantly over time; allocate more to retirement accounts for long-term growth, while keeping safer investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs first, up to annual limits. This ensures you take advantage of employer matches and tax benefits.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Ensure youâ€™re diversified according to your overall risk tolerance and goals.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Contribute to 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Max out IRA contributions**, ideally split between Traditional and Roth.
3. **Invest any remaining funds** in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
