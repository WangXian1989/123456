When distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher growth.
   - Use more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden on interest income.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to manage tax implications. You may want to draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to maintain a low tax bracket.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications:**
   - Think about your current vs. expected future tax rate. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, it may make sense to prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Keep a sufficient cash reserve in an easily accessible account to avoid needing to tap into retirement accounts early.

Balancing these aspects will help you maximize growth while managing tax exposure effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
