I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Limit Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying diseases (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies help track liver function and disease progression.

4. **Possible Procedure:**
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
