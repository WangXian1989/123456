Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows for greater flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) should be held in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit most from tax deferral.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Hold long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-advantaged accounts may be tapped first, but this strategy can vary based on individual tax situations.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
