Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
- **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Balance Contributions
- Allocate funds to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits.
- Once these accounts are maxed out or if you reach income limits for a Roth IRA, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes.
- Consider holding more stable, interest-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they often incur higher taxes in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Reassess Regularly
- Review your allocations annually or as life circumstances change (e.g., job change, market fluctuations).

### 5. Seek Professional Advice
- Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, the key is to create a balanced and diversified strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
