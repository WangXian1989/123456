To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation. The tax advantages can be significant.

3. **Margin of Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate more immediate returns or cash needs. For example, holding stocks in taxable accounts can be beneficial for long-term gains, while bonds or interest-generating assets may be less efficient due to tax implications.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place investments with high tax burdens (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and keep stocks with potential long-term capital gains in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific financial situation and goals.
