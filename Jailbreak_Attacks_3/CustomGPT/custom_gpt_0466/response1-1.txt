Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. This includes traditional IRAs (for tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRAs (for tax-free growth and withdrawals).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in long-term accounts. This can help avoid withdrawing from your retirement savings in case of unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversification**: When investing within these accounts, diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to manage risk and potentially enhance returns.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts allow for more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might want to focus on traditional accounts to lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be beneficial.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial objectives, whether itâ€™s retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
