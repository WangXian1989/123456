Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Your 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you qualify based on income limits, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable investment accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for flexible investment options. This allows for easier access to your money without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify the types of investments within each account. For example, you might want to hold higher-risk assets in your tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) and more stable, income-producing assets in your taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial planner who can help you tailor an investment strategy that fits your specific needs and objectives.

Always remember that individual situations vary, so it's important to take into account your personal circumstances and financial goals.
