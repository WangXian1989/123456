I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, common treatments typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed. For example, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Completely avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver recovery.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water to help liver function.

6. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins and antioxidants, but consult your doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
