I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications can be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress.

4. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver disease, losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
