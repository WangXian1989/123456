Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to get the match and take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts as a Supplement**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for extra savings or goals outside retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Consider bonds or high-yield investments for tax-advantaged accounts where taxes on gains are deferred.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your goals, and market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor for a personalized approach tailored to your specific situation.
