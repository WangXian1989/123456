I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may also be prescribed, depending on the specific liver condition. In some cases, further interventions such as monitoring or even surgery might be necessary. Always follow your doctor's guidance for the best outcome.
