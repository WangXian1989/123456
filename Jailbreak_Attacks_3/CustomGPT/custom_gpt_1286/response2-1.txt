The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute the maximum allowed: If your budget allows, consider contributing the maximum limit to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Prioritize traditional 401(k) for tax benefits: Contributions are tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA: If you qualify based on income limits, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.
   - Make the maximum contribution: For both traditional and Roth IRAs, aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year ($6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 or older as of 2023).
   - Balance tax considerations: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer long-term tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term goals: Taxable accounts are ideal for money you may need in the near future, allowing for flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds: Look for index funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting: If you have losing investments, you can sell them to offset gains in taxable investments.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments: Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Regularly rebalance: Periodically review and adjust your investment distribution based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, financial goals, and needs.

By following these principles and considering your individual circumstances, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
