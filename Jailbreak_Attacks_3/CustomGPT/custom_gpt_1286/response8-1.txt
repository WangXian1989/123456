When deciding how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess your current versus potential future tax brackets to determine which IRA suits your long-term plan better.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need in the short term or for investments that may generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your short-term liquidity needs. Money in a taxable account can typically be accessed more easily without penalties, which can be strategic for emergencies.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align each account type with your specific investment goals and time horizons. Long-term growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more liquid investments could be placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, keeping asset allocation in mind to manage risk effectively.

6. **Annual Contributions**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then direct any additional savings to taxable accounts.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can personalize a strategy based on your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals.
