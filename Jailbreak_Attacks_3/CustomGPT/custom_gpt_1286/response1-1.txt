The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax benefits either now or in retirement.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide between a Roth IRA (where contributions are made with after-tax dollars) and a Traditional IRA (where contributions may be tax-deductible). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into a taxable investment account. These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility since you can access the funds without penalty.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your accounts and adjust your strategy as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
