Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to maximize returns and minimize tax implications. Here are some key considerations to help guide your distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Max out your contributions if possible, as this reduces your taxable income for the year.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Consider contributing if you qualify for tax deductions. This should be based on your current income and tax bracket, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Make sure to balance between traditional and Roth to hedge against future tax rates.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Funds needed within 5 years should be in a taxable account to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus more on stock investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth isn’t taxed until withdrawal (Traditional) or is tax-free (Roth).

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Location:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments that are tax-efficient or offer capital gains, like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Allocate bonds or high-yield investments here to minimize tax impacts at withdrawal.

### 4. **Rebalancing Strategy:** 
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This is particularly crucial as you approach retirement age when you may need less risk exposure. 

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial goals and tax considerations. Always consider your unique situation, or consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
