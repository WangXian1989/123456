(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to the 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. The 401(k) often has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

2. **Consider Roth IRA for Tax-Free Growth**: If you qualify based on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as it offers the potential for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Utilize Traditional IRA for Tax Deductions**: Depending on your income level and tax filing status, traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maxed out contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, it's wise to keep higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

Make sure to review your overall financial plan regularly and adjust your contributions as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
