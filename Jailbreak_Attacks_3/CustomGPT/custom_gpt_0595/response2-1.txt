To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Treatment:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are due upon withdrawal. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment income (dividends, interest, and capital gains) is taxable in the year it is received.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Maximize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first for long-term investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts. For example, as of 2023, the max contribution for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

### 4. **Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to your IRA or taxable accounts. This is effectively "free money."

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Different accounts may serve different purposes. It could be advantageous to place your higher-growth, riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - Consider holding income-generating investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how and when you intend to withdraw from each account during retirement to minimize tax impacts. Some strategies may involve withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out employer match in 401(k).**
2. **Contribute to an IRA up to the limit.**
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions to max limit.**
4. **Invest remaining funds in the taxable account.**

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution of your money will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and optimize your investment distribution.
