To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, since it's essentially free money.
   - For your IRA, consider whether you want a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxes on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed on contributions but tax-free on withdrawals).

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Each account has annual contribution limits. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if you are 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Debt Repayment and Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and are managing any high-interest debt before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: 
   - Within each account, diversify your investments to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Asset Location**: 
   - Be strategic about where you hold certain investments. Generally, it's best to hold higher-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments like bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If youâ€™re uncertain about your investment strategy or need personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to managing your money across different accounts. Would you like further details on any specific aspects?
