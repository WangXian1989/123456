I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options that might be relevant. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), medications may include antivirals, corticosteroids, or drugs that help reduce liver inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet and exercise can play a significant role. Following a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help support liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any worsening conditions early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases (like liver failure or certain tumors), procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people consider supplements (like milk thistle) but it's essential to consult a doctor before starting any.

For an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, please reach out to a healthcare provider.

If you have specific symptoms or a diagnosis, I can provide more detailed information.
