To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Especially if your employer offers a match, aim to max this out first.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out or if you need additional flexibility (like access to funds before retirement age), consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep in mind the type of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account. For example, place higher growth investments (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies in a taxable account.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market performance.

These steps will help you optimize your investments and potentially grow your wealth more effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
