Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a suggested approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 ($30,000 if over 50), which can be advantageous for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you can choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred).
   - **Maxing Out Contributions**: The IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2024. Max out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use this for short-term goals or if you want more liquidity. Consider holding investments like stocks or mutual funds that qualify for long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

### Tips for Allocation:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have 3 to 6 months of living expenses saved.
- **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, consider a diversified portfolio mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on changing goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach prioritizing employer matches and tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility with taxable accounts can optimize your financial growth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
