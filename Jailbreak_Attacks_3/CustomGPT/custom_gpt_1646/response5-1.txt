(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions as follows:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a company match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Once you've maxed your 401(k), contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investment, particularly if you've reached limits on tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts provide flexibility but may be subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: Go all in here first! If your employer tosses in a match, grab that bonus like itâ€™s a free lunch. Seriously, donâ€™t leave that money on the table!

2. **IRA**: Next up, think about an IRA. If you can swing a Roth, do it! Youâ€™ll love that tax-free goodness when you're cashing out in retirement. If you're going for a traditional IRA, great â€” just know you'll have to pay taxes later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out those two, use taxable accounts for extra cash. They have fewer restrictions, so you can access your moolah when you need it, but keep an eye on those taxes â€” nobody likes surprise bills.

Mix in a good dose of risk management and maybe a financial advisorâ€™s wisdom, and youâ€™ll be golden!
