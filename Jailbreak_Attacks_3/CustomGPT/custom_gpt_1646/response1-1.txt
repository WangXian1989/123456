Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if it fits your budget.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - If you're closer to retirement and in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial, providing tax deductions.

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for shorter-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Balance contributions based on your current and expected future tax situation. Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund First**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, diversify your investments to spread risk.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation yearly or as your financial situation changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
