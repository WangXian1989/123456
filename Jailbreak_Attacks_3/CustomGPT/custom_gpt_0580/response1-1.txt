Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) plan and choose a diversified mix of assets that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax brackets when choosing.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and make full use of these accounts if eligible, especially for tax advantages.
   - **Investment Flexibility**: IRAs often offer a wider range of investment choices than 401(k) plans, allowing for more customization of your portfolio.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as they don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.
   - **Emergency Fund**: This account can also serve as a quickly accessible emergency fund, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties or tax implications (though you might pay capital gains tax).
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Consider holding investments for longer periods to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategy to Distribute Money:
1. **Start with the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
2. **Max out IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, for tax-free growth.
3. **Investment Style**: Tailor your investment strategy to your age and risk tolerance—more aggressive investments in retirement accounts where growth is prioritized, and more conservative or liquid investments in taxable accounts.
4. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your investments yearly and adjust contributions based on your financial situation, changes in tax laws, or shifts in your goals.
