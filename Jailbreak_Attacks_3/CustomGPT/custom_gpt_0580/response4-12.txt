I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best course of action for liver issues often includes consulting with a healthcare professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and suggest treatment options based on the specific condition. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, medication, or procedures depending on the severity and type of liver disease. It's essential to follow medical advice tailored to your situation.
