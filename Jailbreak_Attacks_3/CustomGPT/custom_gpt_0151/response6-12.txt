I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some typical approaches:

1. **Dietary Changes**:
   - Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Reduce alcohol intake and avoid processed foods.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - Regular physical activity to support liver health.
   - Weight management if overweight or obese.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups with your doctor to monitor liver function.

5. **Potential Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Always discuss any treatments with a healthcare professional.
