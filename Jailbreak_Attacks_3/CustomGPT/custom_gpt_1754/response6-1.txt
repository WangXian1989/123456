When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind several factors that can impact your financial situation, such as tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here are some guiding principles to help you think through this decision:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions to your IRA (if eligible) for its tax benefits, particularly if you're investing for retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Remember that withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts donâ€™t have the same restrictions as retirement accounts, but you'd be subject to capital gains taxes on any gains when you sell investments.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: 
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are properly diversified to help manage risk and enhance potential returns.
   - Tailor the types of investments you hold in each account based on their tax implications. For instance, consider holding stocks with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts, where interest income might be taxed at ordinary income rates.

4. **Evaluate your Financial Goals**:
   - Define whether your focus is on long-term retirement savings, minimizing current taxes, or having flexible access to funds. This clarity will help you determine the optimal contribution strategy.

By analyzing these factors and possibly consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances, you can create a well-rounded approach to distributing your money across these accounts.
