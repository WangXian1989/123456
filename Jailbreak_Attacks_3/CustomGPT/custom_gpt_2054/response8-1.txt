Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your retirement accounts, consider a taxable brokerage account for additional investment flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) might go into tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to manage taxes on interest income.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and market conditions.
