Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth like a 401(k). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, if certain conditions are met. Choose based on whether you prefer tax benefits now (Traditional) or later (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts don’t have tax advantages, but you can access them anytime without penalties. Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they’re realized.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

4. **Age and Timeline**: Your age and when you expect to retire can impact your distribution strategy. Younger investors might prioritize growth (higher risk, higher reward) in tax-advantaged accounts, while older investors may want to preserve capital.

5. **Investment Options**: Look at the investment options available in each account. Some 401(k) plans have limited choices and higher fees compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Example Approach:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Maximize contributions to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a Traditional IRA.
3. Once you’ve fully funded these accounts, if you have more to invest, allocate funds to a taxable account.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and goals.
