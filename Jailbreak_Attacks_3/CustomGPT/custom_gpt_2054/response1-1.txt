Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize this up to the match limit. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income later.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Aim for a diversified portfolio in all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets. Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
