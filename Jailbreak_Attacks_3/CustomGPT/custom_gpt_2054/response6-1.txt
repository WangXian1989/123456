Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains) or for more flexible withdrawals.

### **Strategies:**
- **Prioritize Contributions:**
  - Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fully fund your IRA, and finally contribute to your taxable account.
- **Asset Allocation Consideration:**
  - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Final Thoughts:**
- Regularly reassess your investment performance and goals to ensure your distribution aligns with your changing needs.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This strategy can help optimize your tax situation while supporting long-term growth.
