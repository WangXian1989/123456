I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in more severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant. Regular monitoring and follow-ups with your doctor are crucial in managing liver health. 

Please make sure to seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition from a qualified healthcare provider.
