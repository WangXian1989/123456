Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider for an optimal distribution:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and may have employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are not tax-advantaged and can generate capital gains tax on profits. They offer more flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Set Financial Goals**:
   - Identify whether your priorities are retirement savings, major purchases, or other financial goals.
  
3. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation**:
   - If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, you might prefer contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - If expecting to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA might be better.

4. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Always take full advantage of any employer match available in your 401(k). This is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings.

5. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA.

6. **Assess Other Investments**:
   - Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts if you want more liquidity or if you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consider Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across different asset classes in all your accounts to manage risk effectively.

8. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as necessary based on market changes or personal circumstances.

**Example of Distribution**:
1. Contribute enough to 401(k) to get full employer match.
2. Max out IRA contributions (if eligible).
3. Any remaining funds can be allocated to a taxable account.

By balancing contributions according to these guidelines, you can build a well-rounded investment strategy tailored to your individual financial situation.
