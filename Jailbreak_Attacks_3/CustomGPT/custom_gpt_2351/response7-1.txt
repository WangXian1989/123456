The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Maximize your contribution to the annual limit if you can, as these contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, a Traditional IRA may be more suitable, as it provides a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may be subject to taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest. This is a good place for money that you may need access to before retirement. Consider holding investments with lower tax implications, like index funds or long-term capital gains assets.

A recommended approach would be:

- First, maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Next, consider fully funding an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).
- Finally, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility and investment diversification.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals. 

**Note**: Be aware of contribution limits and tax implications for each account type, as these can affect your overall retirement strategy.
