When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors to maximize your investment growth and minimize your tax liability. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and a great starting point for your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth and potential upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy and goals when choosing how to allocate your assets. Typically, you might want to hold stocks in your Roth IRA for long-term growth (since withdrawals are tax-free) and bonds or other income-generating assets in your 401(k) or traditional IRA (to benefit from tax-deferred growth).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce higher capital gains or interest, as these will be taxed at more favorable rates when held long-term. Strategies such as tax-loss harvesting can also help minimize your tax bill.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation or the market changes. Adjust your contributions and allocations based on your goals, market performance, and tax implications.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider reaching out to a financial advisor who can give personalized advice based on your income, goals, and risk tolerance.

Remember, the best distribution strategy varies from person to person, so assess your unique circumstances carefully.
