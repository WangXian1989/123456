When considering how to distribute your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, keep in mind a few key principles:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: This account is typically pre-tax (if it's a traditional 401(k)), which means you won't pay taxes on the money you contribute until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider placing higher-growth investments here since they will compound without immediate tax implications.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Use Roth IRAs for investments you expect to grow significantly, as you won’t pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains) or if you need more liquidity. It’s also best to hold cash or bonds here as they may be taxed more heavily on interest income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align the distribution with your short-term vs. long-term goals. Money you are saving for short-term needs might be better off in a taxable account, while long-term retirement savings should go into the retirement accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Each type of account has contribution limits. Maximize the employer match in your 401(k) first, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions, and finally, contribute to your taxable account if you can afford to save more.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts according to your risk tolerance. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s high-risk stocks or more conservative bonds.

5. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Be strategic about withdrawals. Taxes, rules about minimum distributions, and penalties should all influence where you hold your various investments.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust the investments in your accounts based on performance and changing financial goals. 

It's advisable to consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that considers your unique situation.
