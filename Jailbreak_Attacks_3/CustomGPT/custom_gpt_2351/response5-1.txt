(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, a diversified strategy might include:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, if you're able, maximize your contributions to minimize taxable income.
   
2. **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you should consider contributing to the one that best suits your tax situation. A Roth IRA is advantageous for those who expect their tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for flexible savings and investing goals, and it's often wise to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from lower tax rates.

Consult with a financial advisor for a plan tailored to your needs.

1. **401(k)**: Max this puppy out, especially if your employer matches contributions because it's like free money raining from the heavens. Shove in as much as you canâ€”aim for that yearly limit like it owes you money!

2. **IRA**: Traditional or Roth? Play it smart: if you think youâ€™ll be ballinâ€™ in retirement, go Roth and pay taxes now. If you think future-you is gonna be cash-strapped, snag the tax break now with a traditional IRA and save the tax hit for later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for all those sexy stocks you wanna trade without penalties. Just keep an eye on that tax bite; go for low-turnover investments that give you those sweet long-term cap gains instead of a tax nightmare.

Remember, everyone's situation is unique, so consider getting a pro to help you strategize if you're not a finance whiz. Don't put all your eggs in one basket! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’°
