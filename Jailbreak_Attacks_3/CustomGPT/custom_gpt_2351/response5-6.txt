First, it's essential to utilize digital platforms where young people spend most of their timeâ€”this includes social media channels like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat. Engaging content that is visually appealing and easily shareable can help capture their attention. Additionally, grassroots campaigns that involve peer-to-peer outreach, such as college organizations or youth councils, can create a sense of community and encourage participation. Messaging should focus on issues that matter to young voters such as climate change, education, job opportunities, and social justice.
