Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax advantages. Invest in assets that generate high returns but may be taxed heavily (e.g., bonds) in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate low taxes, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile, high-growth investments.
   - Consider holding more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts for better tax treatment.

4. **Debt Consideration**:
   - Pay down high-interest debt before investing significantly. 

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes and sectors according to your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
