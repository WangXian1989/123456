I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant or other surgeries may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
