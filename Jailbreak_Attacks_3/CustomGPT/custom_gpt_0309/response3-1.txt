To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match and then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, this is where you’d put more aggressive investments like stocks.
   - **IRA**: Consider bonds for stability or more aggressive options, depending on your timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Aim for a balance of growth and income-generating investments.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications; typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: Max out annual contribution
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest surplus funds after maximizing other accounts
