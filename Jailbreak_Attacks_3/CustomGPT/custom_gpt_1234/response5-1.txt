Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund the IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax bracket. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them a great choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve funded your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum limit if your employer allows.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

It’s also beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
