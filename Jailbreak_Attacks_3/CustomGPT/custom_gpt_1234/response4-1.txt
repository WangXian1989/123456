Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: If itâ€™s a traditional IRA, like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are taxed annually, and capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments. Consider holding assets here that have lower turnover and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing long-term.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your time horizon. For longer-term goals (like retirement), a higher allocation in stocks may be appropriate, while shorter-term goals may warrant more conservative investments.

5. **Diversification**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Make regular contributions to each account to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging, which can help reduce volatility over time.

7. **Rebalancing**: Assess your allocation periodically (e.g., annually) and rebalance as needed to maintain your intended asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific situation, a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies.

The optimal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so review your strategy regularly as your needs and market conditions change.
