Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guide to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as these funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider prioritizing that for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contribute after maximizing the 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

4. **General Rules**:
   - Have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
