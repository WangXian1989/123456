To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), fund an IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA). Check your eligibility for tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money that you might need before retirement. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Balancing Act**:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment mix based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors often benefit from more equities, while older investors might prefer bonds and safer assets.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. If you're in a lower bracket, consider converting some traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA for future tax benefits.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and changing circumstances.
