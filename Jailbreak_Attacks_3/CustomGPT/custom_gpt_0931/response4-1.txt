Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly influence your long-term growth. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you make them. You'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but you may be limited based on income and retirement plan participation.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualifying withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments, so consider holding assets for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a more liquid form, like a savings account.

6. **Long-Term Timeline**: If your investment horizon is long (10+ years), consider investing more aggressively in stocks across your accounts, knowing you have time to recover from market fluctuations.

7. **Adjust as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment choices based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances and objectives.
