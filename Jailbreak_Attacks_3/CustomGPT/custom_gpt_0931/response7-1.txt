Investing strategies can be complex and depend on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general guide on how to distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may earn capital gains or interest and do not fit within the tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use these accounts for investments that may generate less frequent capital gains (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Generating Investments**: Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in a taxable account where the tax rates may be lower than ordinary income rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your holdings periodically (at least annually) to ensure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and goals. 

### 5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before diving deep into these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund saved to cover unexpected expenses.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 10% (or max contribution limit)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% (for shorter-term goals)

Adjust these percentages based on your specific situation.

### Conclusion:
It’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to build a personalized strategy that best fits your circumstances. Making informed choices today can lead to significant benefits in the long run.
