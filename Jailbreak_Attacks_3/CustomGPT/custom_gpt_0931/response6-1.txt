Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Typically, the match is a percentage of your contributions, so ensure you understand your employer's policy.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Great for current tax savings.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest After Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility. Remember that you'll pay capital gains tax on any profits.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance:
     - **Aggressive Growth:** If young and risk-tolerant, focus on stocks.
     - **Balanced Approach:** If closer to retirement, consider a mix of stocks and bonds.
     
### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio annually or after significant life events to ensure alignment with your goals.

### General Guideline:
- **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match; consider maxing out if you can.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions next.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for flexibility beyond retirement accounts.

Tailor your allocation based on your personal situation, goals, and financial plans. Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights.
