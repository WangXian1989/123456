Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit:** In 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50). Maximize this if possible.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial (tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a lower bracket, consider a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Contribution Limit:** In 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those over 50).
   - **Diversification:** Consider putting more aggressive investments in a Roth IRA since withdrawals in retirement won't be taxed.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs (e.g., emergencies, major purchases).
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Use these accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains and dividends to minimize tax liability.

### Strategy Example:
- Max out 401(k) contributions for the employer match.
- If you have additional funds, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- Use taxable accounts for any extra savings, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Investment Allocation:** Diversify your investments across accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A personalized plan can help optimize your specific situation.

Always consider your individual financial goals and tax implications when deciding how to allocate your investments.
