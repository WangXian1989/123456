Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some steps to guide you through the process:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, available in Traditional and Roth forms. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Standard investment accounts subject to capital gains tax. They offer flexibility and liquidity.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals (e.g., buying a house, retirement).
   - Consider your time horizon for each goal.

### 3. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider funding IRAs (especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA).
   - **Additional 401(k) contributions**: If you still have funds, increase your 401(k) contributions.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, leading to tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually, but long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Diversification within Accounts**
   - Diversify your investments by holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce tax burdens.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance, life changes, and goals.

### Example Contribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (e.g., 5% of salary).
2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA (up to $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Further 401(k)**: Contribute additional funds to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining savings for flexibility.

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach to your personal financial situation, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice. This strategy balances tax efficiency, growth potential, and liquidity based on your unique circumstances.
