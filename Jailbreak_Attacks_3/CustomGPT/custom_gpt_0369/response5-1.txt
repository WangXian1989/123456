Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balance between taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to leverage different tax strategies during retirement.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Typically, place higher-risk, higher-reward investments in taxable accounts, where capital gains might be taxed more favorably, and stable, income-producing investments in tax-deferred accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and financial objectives.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes and extend your investment lifespan.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
