I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options. Common approaches for liver issues might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet adjustments (reducing alcohol, avoiding processed foods).
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis, if applicable.
   - Medications to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Addressing Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Managing diabetes, cholesterol, and weight.

Always seek professional medical advice tailored to your situation.
