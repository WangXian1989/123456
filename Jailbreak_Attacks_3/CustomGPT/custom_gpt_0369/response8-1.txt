Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can offer tax advantages depending on your income and tax filing status.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding bonds or high-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
