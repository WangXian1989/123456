Distributing your money across different accounts—401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts—depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income level and future tax expectations.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. Consider using index funds or ETFs for lower fees and broad market exposure.

4. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth, as these can compound tax-free. More conservative investments can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Adjust Over Time**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed.
3. **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here for short- to medium-term goals.

### Final Tips:
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
- Review your contributions and investments regularly to ensure alignment with your goals.

This balanced strategy can help promote long-term growth while providing necessary liquidity and tax efficiencies.
