To optimize your investment strategy, consider these steps for distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. Then, fund your IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.
   
2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: In higher tax brackets, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income.

3. **Assess Investment Goals**: Align contributions with short-term vs. long-term goals. Keep riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that create less taxable income (like index funds). Keep high-yield investments in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain sufficient liquidity outside retirement accounts for emergencies before aggressively investing in 401(k) or IRA.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes (like income increases or major expenses).

Consult a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
