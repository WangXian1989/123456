To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, max out your IRA contributions if possible.

2. **Diversify Investments**: In your 401(k) and IRA, choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversification can reduce risk.

3. **Tax Strategies**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as long-term capital gains are usually taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: If you may need access to funds before retirement, keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Reassess**: Review your distribution strategy regularly, especially as your financial situation and tax laws change.
