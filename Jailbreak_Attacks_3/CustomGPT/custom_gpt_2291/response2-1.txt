Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a concise strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as that’s free money.
  
2. **Fund IRA**: Once you reach the employer match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax bracket and retirement goals. A Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you maximize tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

4. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts while being mindful of tax implications for investments (like interest vs. capital gains).

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Tailor this approach to your specific circumstances and consult a financial advisor if needed.
