To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income, while withdrawals will be taxed.
   - Taxable accounts allow you to access cash anytime, but capital gains can incur taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, as they often provide tax benefits either now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: 
   - Younger individuals may favor growth investments, while those closer to retirement should emphasize stability.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: 
   - Strategically plan withdrawals based on tax implications to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution that enhances your retirement savings while optimizing tax efficiency.
