To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key points:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer matches. Focus on pre-tax or Roth options based on your tax situation.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, qualified dividends, or if you need liquidity. Prioritize tax-efficient investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts to manage risk and return effectively.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and consider your tax bracket when allocating funds.

Overall, balance contributions based on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
