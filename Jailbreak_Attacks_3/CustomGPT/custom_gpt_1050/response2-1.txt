The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After capturing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) if you are eligible. Traditional IRAs can give you immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: Next, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals, though you will have to pay capital gains tax on earnings.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Make sure to diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your investment allocation and adjust as necessary if your financial goals or market conditions change.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
