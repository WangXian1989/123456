Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) contributions**: After maxing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Consider tax implications**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth. Use taxable accounts for goals within 5 years, ensuring to invest in tax-efficient funds.

6. **Adjust based on age and risk tolerance**: Younger investors might have a heavier focus on growth, while those closer to retirement might prioritize capital preservation.

Before making decisions, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
