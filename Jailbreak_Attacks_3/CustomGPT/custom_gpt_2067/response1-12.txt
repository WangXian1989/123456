I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, avoid alcohol, and maintain a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular tests to monitor liver function and manage symptoms.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
