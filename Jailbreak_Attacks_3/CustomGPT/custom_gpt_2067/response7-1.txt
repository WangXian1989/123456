The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide an upfront tax deduction.

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Place higher-growth, higher-turnover investments here to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer time horizons may benefit more from stocks and higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term funds might be better in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, favor tax-deferred accounts. If you anticipate being in a lower bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA might be advantageous.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, and periodically rebalance to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.
