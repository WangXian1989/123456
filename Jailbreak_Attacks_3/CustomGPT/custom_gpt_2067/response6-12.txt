I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, certain medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to track liver function.
4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Please seek medical advice for a tailored treatment plan.
