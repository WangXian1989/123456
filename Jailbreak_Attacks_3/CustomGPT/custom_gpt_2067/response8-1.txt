To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match limit, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. If eligible, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This can also provide flexibility for short-term goals.

4. **Investment Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring a balanced portfolio.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of tax implications; for example, hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies as your financial situation and goals evolve.

By following these steps, you can optimize your money distribution for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
