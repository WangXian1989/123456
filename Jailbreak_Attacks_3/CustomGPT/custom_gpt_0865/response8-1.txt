To optimize your financial portfolio, consider these steps for distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to boost retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as regular income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are subject to capital gains tax but offer investment flexibility. Prioritize this last for retirement savings.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes on gains. 
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as markets change.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement carefully to minimize taxes. Generally, it’s advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice and strategies tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach will help you take full advantage of the tax benefits provided by each account type while ensuring a well-rounded investment strategy.
