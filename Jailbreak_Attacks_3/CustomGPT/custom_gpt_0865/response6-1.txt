Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors like your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might produce significant short-term gains or interest, which could lead to higher tax liabilities.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Hold investments with lower turnover in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. Diversify Investments
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider using low-cost index funds or ETFs for broader market exposure.

### 4. Liquid vs. Illiquid Needs
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid assets for emergencies outside your retirement accounts.
   - **Retirement Horizon**: Focus on growth in accounts meant for long-term retirement, while considering liquidity for other goals.

### 5. Review Regularly
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Regularly assess the performance of your accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - **Stay Informed**: Keep track of changes in tax laws and retirement account rules that may affect your strategy.

### Summary
Start with sufficient contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs for the tax benefits, consider your investment goals and risk tolerance, and keep reviewing your strategy as your financial situation evolves. If needed, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
