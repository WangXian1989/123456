Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax advantages, especially if your employer matches contributions. Great for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Both provide tax benefits. Traditional IRAs give tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA next for additional tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that are less tax-efficient.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments might be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable options could be in taxable accounts.
   - **Time Horizon**: Longer-term investments (e.g., stocks) can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term needs might be best in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep tax efficiency in mind. For example, placing high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize immediate tax burdens.
   - Consider your current and anticipated future tax rates when deciding between traditional and Roth accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that suits your specific situation and goals.

Balancing your assets across these accounts can optimize growth while minimizing taxes over time.
