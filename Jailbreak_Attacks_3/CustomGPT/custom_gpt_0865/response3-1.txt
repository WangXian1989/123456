Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a strategy you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** After getting the match, consider contributing to an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA based on income, this account can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Decide based on whether you prefer to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).

### 3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**
   - Once you have funded your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can further reduce your taxable income.

### 4. **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional savings after maximizing retirement account contributions. These funds can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, giving you more flexibility.

### 5. **Consider Asset Location**
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in your taxable account since capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Higher-turnover investments (like actively managed funds) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Your financial situation may change, so regularly review your contributions and investment allocation. Adjust your strategy based on any shifts in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you feel overwhelmed, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can customize a plan tailored to your specific circumstances.

### Summary
1. Max out employer match in 401(k).
2. Contribute to IRA (considering tax implications).
3. Continue funding 401(k) to limit.
4. Use taxable accounts last.
5. Consider the tax efficiency of the assets you hold.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your investments while minimizing taxes over time.
