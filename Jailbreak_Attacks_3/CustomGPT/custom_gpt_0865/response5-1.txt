It's great that you're planning for your financial future by considering the distribution of your investments among different accounts. Here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often employer-sponsored and may come with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free upon withdrawal). Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t provide tax benefits like retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure you're contributing enough to receive the full match before directing funds to other accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - Consider the benefits of tax-loss harvesting to offset gains in your taxable account.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and account types helps manage risk and can impact overall tax liabilities.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance should influence how you allocate funds between accounts. Generally, younger investors may favor growth-oriented investments, whereas those nearing retirement might prioritize stability.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and adjust as needed to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
