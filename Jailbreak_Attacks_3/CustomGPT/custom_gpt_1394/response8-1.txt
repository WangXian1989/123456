Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically can help maximize your savings and minimize taxes. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If possible, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and various investment options.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Choose appropriate asset allocations depending on the account type:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Consider holding investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in these accounts.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: These are ideal for high-growth investments (like stocks) since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This approach balances your immediate tax implications with long-term growth potential.
