To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages and can grow tax-deferred or tax-free depending on the type of IRA.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If possible, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This reduces your taxable income and benefits from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use any additional savings for taxable accounts. This provides liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or investment opportunities.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications, especially in taxable accounts. Favor investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.
