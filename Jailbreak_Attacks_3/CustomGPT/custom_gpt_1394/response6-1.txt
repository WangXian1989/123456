The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Think about using this for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax; prioritize short-term needs and liquid investments.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first. 
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access within 5 years.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligned with your risk profile across all accounts.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth assets (e.g., stocks) and allocate more stable investments (e.g., bonds) to taxable accounts to manage tax impact.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Adhere to annual contribution limits for each account: 401(k) and IRA have specific caps that may affect how you allocate funds.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your investments to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%

Adjust based on your specific circumstances. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
