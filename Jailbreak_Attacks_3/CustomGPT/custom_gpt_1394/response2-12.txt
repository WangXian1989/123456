Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, and medications to reduce liver inflammation.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight management, and exercise can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Complete abstinence from alcohol is critical for recovering liver function.

4. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult your doctor before starting any supplements.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
