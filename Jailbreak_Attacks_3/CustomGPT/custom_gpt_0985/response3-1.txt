To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Identify when you'll need access to the funds.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for long-term growth, especially if there’s an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages with potential for tax-free growth if it’s a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for flexibility and access to funds without penalties but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-rounded portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments in each account type.
   - Take advantage of tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on your tax situation to minimize tax liability.
   - Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your unique situation.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
