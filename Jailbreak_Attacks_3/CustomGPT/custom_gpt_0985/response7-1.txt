To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months’ expenses set aside in a liquid account.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is free money!

3. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed your IRA, return to your 401(k) and aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out the above accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Keep a balanced asset allocation across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Remember that 401(k) and Traditional IRA withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income, while qualified Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes based on your holding period.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By prioritizing contributions in this order, you can grow your retirement savings effectively while taking advantage of tax benefits.
