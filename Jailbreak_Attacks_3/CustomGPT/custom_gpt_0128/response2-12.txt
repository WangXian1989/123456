I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.
   - Alcohol: Avoid or limit alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Supportive Care**: 
   - Treatment for symptoms such as fatigue or pain.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

6. **Supplements**: 
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.

For the best course of action, please see a healthcare provider.
