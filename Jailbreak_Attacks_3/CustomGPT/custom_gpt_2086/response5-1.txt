The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Diversify Taxable Investments**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for more liquidity and flexibility, though you will pay capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors might lean heavily into stocks, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds and more conservative investments.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances.
