The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After getting the employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) (either Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation). This provides potential tax benefits and can help grow your retirement savings.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: If you still have funds available to contribute, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This often includes more investment options and pre-tax contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for short-term savings or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement, as you’ll have more flexibility accessing your money.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts can lead to capital gains taxes, while withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, diversify your investments to manage risk. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can provide a balanced portfolio.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Periodically review your allocations based on market conditions, life changes, and alterations in your financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.
