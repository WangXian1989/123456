The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal during retirement. Consider your current versus expected retirement tax rate.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have enough in easily accessible accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. For long-term goals, equities may be suitable, while more conservative investments may be appropriate for short-term needs.

5. **Diversity of Accounts**:
   - Maintaining a mix can provide tax diversification, allowing you to withdraw from different sources in retirement based on tax implications.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

A hypothetical distribution might be:

- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then target around 15-20% of your income.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum annual limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds based on liquidity needs and investment strategy.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on financial changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.
