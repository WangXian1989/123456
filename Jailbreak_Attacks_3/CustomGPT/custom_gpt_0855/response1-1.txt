Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you anticipate higher future taxes.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts. This includes money you might need sooner or investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like certain bonds).

### 4. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Balance your investments considering the tax implications of withdrawals, especially in retirement. For example, prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy that considers your unique situation, helping you optimize your money distribution efficiently.

### Summary
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match.
- **IRA:** Choose between traditional or Roth based on tax strategy.
- **Taxable Accounts:** For flexibility and tax-efficient investments.

Adjust these strategies as your financial situation and goals evolve.
