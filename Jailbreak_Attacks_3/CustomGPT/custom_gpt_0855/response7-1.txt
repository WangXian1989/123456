Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is free money and a great return on investment.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match, especially if you qualify for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500, and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - Evaluate your expected tax rate during retirement versus your current tax rate. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA.
   - Consider diversifying your investments within each account to manage risk.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Immediate Needs:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a separate, liquid account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. This allows for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Your needs and goals may change, so it's essential to review your allocations periodically and make adjustments as necessary.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
