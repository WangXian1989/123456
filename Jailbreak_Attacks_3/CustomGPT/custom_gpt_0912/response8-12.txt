I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver issues, it's really important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition, but they might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or treat infections.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from liver-supporting supplements like milk thistle, but itâ€™s best to discuss this with a doctor.
5. **Injections or Procedures**: In cases of severe liver damage, treatments like blood transfusions or even a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always prioritize guidance from your healthcare provider for the most appropriate care tailored to your situation.
