Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (for traditional accounts) or post-tax (for Roth accounts). Consider your current tax bracket and expected future tax rate when choosing between these.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk. Different accounts might be better for different types of investments based on their tax treatments.

4. **Withdrawal Planning**: Think about when you’ll need access to your funds. Tax-advantaged accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawal, so keep those for long-term savings.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances vary, getting professional advice tailored to your specific situation can be very beneficial.

**Example Distribution**:
- **401(k)**: Max to get full employer match, then consider additional contributions depending on your tax situation.
- **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions, prioritizing a Roth if you expect higher taxes later.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth and tax-efficient investments.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investment growth while considering taxes and accessibility.
