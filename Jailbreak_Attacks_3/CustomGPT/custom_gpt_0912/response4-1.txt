Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing in these accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** 
   - Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These may provide more flexibility for withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance Risk and Reward:** 
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might opt for more equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or conservative investments.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawals:**
   - If you foresee needing to access funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts to avoid penalties from early withdrawals in retirement accounts.

6. **Annual Review:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that meets your specific needs.
