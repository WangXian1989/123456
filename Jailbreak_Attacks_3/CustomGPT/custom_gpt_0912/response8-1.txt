Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high-fee options, consider directing your contributions here first to benefit from employer matching.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the employer match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth contributions are taxed upfront but provide tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for investments you may want to access before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Keep an Eye on Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Monitor your investments and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice from a professional can help navigate complex situations and optimize your specific distributions.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
