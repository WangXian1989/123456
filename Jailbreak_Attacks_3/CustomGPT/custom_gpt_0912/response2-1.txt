Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a strategic approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If you have high contribution limits and tax-deferred growth, prioritize this after capturing the employer match.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible and think you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (like index funds) or for short-term needs since withdrawals aren't penalized.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Tax-deferred accounts reduce your taxable income now but taxes will apply when you withdraw. Consider balancing between tax-deferred growth and taxable investments for flexibility.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in cash or cash-equivalents outside these accounts before prioritizing investments.

### 6. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon in all accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation depending on market conditions and your changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of income (maxing employer match)
- **IRA:** 10% of income (maxing contribution limit)
- **Taxable Accounts:** 5-10% of income for additional investments or short-term goals.

### Final Consideration:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals.
