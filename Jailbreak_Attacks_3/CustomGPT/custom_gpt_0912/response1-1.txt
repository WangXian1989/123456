Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Itâ€™s essentially free money!

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial for the tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments with a high likelihood of generating taxes (like high-dividend stocks) or funds you may need for short-term goals. Taxable accounts offer flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: It might be wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts is about maximizing growth while managing risk and taxation effectively!
