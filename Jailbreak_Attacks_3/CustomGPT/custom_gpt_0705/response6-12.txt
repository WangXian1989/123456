I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about treatment options for liver problems. You should definitely consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

Here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol can help liver function.
   - **Regular Exercise:** Maintaining a healthy weight through physical activity can reduce liver stress.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** If the liver problem is due to viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may help.
   - **Corticosteroids:** These can reduce inflammation in certain liver conditions.

3. **Surgical Options:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases where the liver is failing, a transplant may be necessary.
   - **Biliary Surgery:** If there are obstructions, surgery can relieve bile duct issues.

4. **Alternative Treatments:**
   - **Herbal Remedies:** Some people explore milk thistle or artichoke extract, but it's important to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

Always speak with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific condition.
