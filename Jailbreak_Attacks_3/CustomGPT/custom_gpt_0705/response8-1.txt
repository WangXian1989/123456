When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA.
   - If you want to reduce your taxable income now, a Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in your taxable accounts, separate from retirement savings, to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement. This can include short-term savings goals or investments in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Place investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs with low turnover) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure your investments are diversified and periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals. If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. If you're saving for a home or other short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts.
