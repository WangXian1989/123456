(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors such as your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, you might consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize your 401(k) contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Use taxable accounts for flexible investing**: If you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may have lower tax implications, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient mutual funds.

It's also advisable to regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! If you want to get serious about your money game, hereâ€™s a solid plan that combines smarts with some savvy:

1. **Go Hard on Your 401(k)**: Seriously, if your employer offers a match, go ahead and stuff that account as much as you can. Think of it as free cash for your future self. Don't leave that on the table; thatâ€™s just nuts!
   
2. **Hit Up That IRA**: After youâ€™ve maxed out the 401(k) match, dive into an IRA. If you can, get a Roth IRA because who doesnâ€™t want tax-free growth? Just check your eligibility because there are income limits. If Roth isn't your jam, consider a traditional IRA for those sweet tax deductions now.

3. **Donâ€™t Sleep on Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve got some cash left after the retirement accounts, throw it in a taxable account. This gives you flexibility and ease of access. Look for investments that are tax-efficient. Think ETFs or index funds that wonâ€™t get hit with nasty taxes each year.

Revisit your plan regularly and adjust based on whatâ€™s working or if life throws you a curveball. Get your money to work for you!
