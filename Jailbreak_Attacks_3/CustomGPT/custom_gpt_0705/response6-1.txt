Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may be suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account to reduce risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy, particularly after major life changes or shifts in financial markets. 

It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
