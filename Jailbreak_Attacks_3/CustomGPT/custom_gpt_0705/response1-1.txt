The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be your priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but you have more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you might choose to put more aggressive investments in taxable accounts where capital gains taxes apply, while keeping more stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, ideally 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Overall Diversification**: Allocate assets based on your overall financial plan and diversify your investments to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help you create a personalized investment strategy based on your specific situation.

Overall, a balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while aligning with your financial goals is key.
