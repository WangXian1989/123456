When planning the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors for an effective strategy:

1. **Tax implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may be tax-deductible, and the funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received, and capital gains are taxed when assets are sold.

2. **Contribution limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is typically $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Investment options**:
   - Consider the investment choices available within your 401(k) and IRA. Some plans have limited options while others may have robust selections. Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility but come with immediate tax consequences.

4. **Time horizon**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to benefit from longer-term growth potential before retirement tax implications kick in.
   - For longer investment horizons, consider balances that allow for more aggressive growth strategies.

5. **Emergency fund**:
   - Maintain sufficient liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs, as 401(k) and IRA funds are generally not accessible without penalties until retirement age.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is free money.
- **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
- **Return to 401(k)**: Once you’ve maxed your IRA, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions as needed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any investment beyond retirement accounts and for short-term savings or investment goals.

### Example Allocation:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to reach the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable.
3. **401(k)**: Increase contributions to the limit.
4. **Taxable accounts**: Use leftover funds for additional investments or savings.

This balanced approach should help optimize growth while being mindful of taxes and retirement goals. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your unique situation.
