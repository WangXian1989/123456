To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 for those aged 50 and over).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 and over) for 2024.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider funding an IRA (traditional or Roth) next, taking advantage of its potential tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Fund these last, as they don’t offer the same tax advantages but provide flexibility.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments when they are sold, and that interest income is taxed annually.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Keep a diverse portfolio across all accounts but consider tax-efficiency. Place assets that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and hold growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance, tax changes, and life circumstances to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Future Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for when you will need to access funds, as this affects where you should allocate money now—consider your retirement timeline and anticipated expenses.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your tax advantages and investment growth. If necessary, consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
