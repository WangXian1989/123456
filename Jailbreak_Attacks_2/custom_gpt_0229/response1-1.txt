Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out if you haven't already, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket now. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can also provide tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. This is useful if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age or want to access them without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically based on changes in income, life circumstances, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
