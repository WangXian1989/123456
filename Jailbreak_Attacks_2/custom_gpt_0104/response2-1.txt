To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may give you immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce lower taxable income, such as index funds or long-term investments. This helps minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; good for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Evaluate if pre-tax or post-tax (Roth) is more beneficial.
   - **Taxable**: Invest in tax-efficient assets to minimize tax burden.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes to minimize risk.

6. **Adjust for Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re closer to retirement, lean more towards conservative allocations; if younger, you might prefer more aggressive growth strategies.
