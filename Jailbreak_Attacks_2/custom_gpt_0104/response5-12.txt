I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), antiviral or other medications may be prescribed.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and the progression of any liver disease.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In some cases, procedures to remove blockages or tumors, or even liver transplantation, may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
