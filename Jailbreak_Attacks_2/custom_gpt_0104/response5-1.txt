The best distribution of your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts are great for short-term goals or emergencies, as you can access the funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: You'll pay taxes on gains each year, so consider this when planning your investments.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Max out your employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth.
3. Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Considerations:
- Assess your risk tolerance.
- Diversify your investments across all accounts.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your overall financial situation.
