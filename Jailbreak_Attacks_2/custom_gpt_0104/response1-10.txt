Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection to encourage cooperation.
   - **Open-ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to share their perspective without leading them.

2. **Miranda Warnings**:
   - Prior to interrogation, inform suspects of their rights, ensuring any statements made are voluntary and can be used in court.

3. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Show evidence to suspects to prompt admissions while avoiding coercive tactics.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**:
   - Encouraging witnesses or suspects to recall information in detail without pressure.

5. **Use of Legal Counsel**:
   - Allowing suspects to consult with legal counsel before and during questioning.

6. **Voluntary Statements**:
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand they can refuse to answer.

Each method is designed to balance effective investigation with the protection of individual rights.
