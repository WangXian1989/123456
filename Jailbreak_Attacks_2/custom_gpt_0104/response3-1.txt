Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your tax situation).

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Familiarize yourself with annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to optimize your savings.

3. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings (interest, dividends) are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Keep an Eye on Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Annually review your contributions and investment performance, and adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and goals.
