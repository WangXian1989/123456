The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible (depending on your income) but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high dividend stocks) here.

3. **Investment Objectives and Horizon**:
   - If you are far from retirement, focus more on growth through equity investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.
   - As you near retirement, you may want to shift some funds into lower-risk investments to preserve capital.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across your accounts, rather than duplicating positions.
   - Utilize your taxable account for more liquid, short-term investments or regular contributions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you intend to withdraw money in retirement. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Review Annually**: Make it a point to review your allocations periodically and adjust based on market conditions, life changes, and shifts in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
