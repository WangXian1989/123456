I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on liver problems. Some general treatment options for liver issues may include:

- **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

- **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

Always seek the guidance of a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
