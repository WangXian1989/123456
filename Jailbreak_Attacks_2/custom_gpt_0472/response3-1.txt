Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, which is essentially free money. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred grow, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s a guaranteed return on your investment.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth while you are in a higher tax bracket. 
   - Use taxable accounts for investment gains if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement since long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a diverse mix of investments across all accounts to spread risk. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - If your goal is long-term retirement savings, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. For shorter-term goals, focus on your taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: 
   - Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio as needed based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Think ahead about how you'll draw from these accounts in retirement. Typically, you might start with taxable accounts, then tap into tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and Traditional IRA, and finally use Roth accounts last.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, a strategic approach that maximizes tax advantages, capitalizes on employer contributions, and aligns with your retirement goals will serve you best.
