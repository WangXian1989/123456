Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax implications, and your individual goals. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation.
    
3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use them for flexibility and short-term savings. Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.
   - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Balance Risk and Return**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Annually**: Regularly assess your allocations and adjust as needed based on market performance and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
