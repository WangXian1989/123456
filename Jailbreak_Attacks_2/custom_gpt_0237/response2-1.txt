To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on lower-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that may benefit from tax-free growth, such as equities or growth-focused funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments with favorable tax treatments, like municipal bonds or long-term capital gains assets.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., 401(k) and IRA limits).

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy considering tax implications, aiming to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts wisely, you can optimize your tax liability and enhance your retirement savings.
