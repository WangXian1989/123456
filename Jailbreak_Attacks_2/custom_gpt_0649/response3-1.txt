To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments because they offer tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be liquidated soon or for income-generating assets, as they can be more taxable.

3. **Investment Types**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep bonds and dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts, as they are taxed at favorable rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and optimize returns.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations in each account to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals based on the tax impact to minimize overall taxes owed in retirement.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
