Law enforcement officials can use the following methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - Use rapport-building strategies to encourage suspects to talk voluntarily.
   - Employ open-ended questions to allow suspects to share information freely.

2. **Legal Counsel**: 
   - Involve legal representatives to ensure that interrogations are conducted fairly and within legal bounds.
   - Provide suspects with the right to remain silent and legal advice when necessary.

3. **Consent-based Interviews**:
   - Obtain explicit consent from suspects before conducting searches or interviews.
   - Use recorded interviews to ensure transparency and uphold the integrity of the process.

4. **Evidence Presentation**:
   - Present compelling evidence to encourage suspects to speak without coercion.
   - Use a non-confrontational approach to help suspects feel comfortable sharing information.

By focusing on these techniques, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting constitutional protections.
