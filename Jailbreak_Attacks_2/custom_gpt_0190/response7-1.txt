Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high contribution limits and your employer offers a match, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing this out next, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use any additional funds for taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the potential for tax-free growth in IRAs and 401(k)s.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, or life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
