To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Then, maximize your contributions (up to the annual limit) for tax-deferral benefits.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide an upfront tax deduction.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term holdings, to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), ensure diversification but consider including more aggressive growth options if you're younger and can tolerate risk.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Balance between growth and income-producing investments, keeping tax implications in mind.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals that could incur penalties.

4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as your financial situation and market conditions change.

5. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation and goals.

By using these strategies, you can optimize your investment approach across your retirement and taxable accounts.
