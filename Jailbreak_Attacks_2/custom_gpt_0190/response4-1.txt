Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first—it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the legal limit, especially if there’s a match. Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, but has income limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be advantageous for long-term capital gains.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Spread investments across account types to manage tax implications. For example, high-growth investments might be best in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains tax.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changing circumstances, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By balancing contributions strategically among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and grow your investments effectively.
