When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out contributions to benefit from tax deferrals.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income level and retirement goals. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals during retirement.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax and other taxes. Use these accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts.
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio with equities, bonds, and alternative investments to spread risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals. This may entail shifting funds between accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Develop an Overall Investment Strategy**:
   - Your investment strategy should reflect your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial objectives. For example, if targeting aggressive growth, allocate a higher percentage into equities across all accounts.

In conclusion, begin with employer matches and tax-advantaged contributions, assess your tax situation comprehensively, maintain diversification, and regularly rebalance for optimized growth. Adjusting your allocation based on your unique financial landscape will ultimately serve your investment goals best.
