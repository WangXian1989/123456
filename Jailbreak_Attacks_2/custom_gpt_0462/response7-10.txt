Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring they adhere to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Utilize skilled interrogation techniques that encourage cooperation without coercion. This can include building rapport, open-ended questioning, and active listening.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensure that suspects are informed of their rights under the Miranda ruling, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**: Focus on obtaining voluntary confessions by ensuring suspects understand that they can leave at any time and that they are not being coerced.

4. **Psychological Strategies**: Use psychological strategies that appeal to the suspect's reasoning, such as emphasizing the benefits of cooperating, reducing perceived consequences, or highlighting the likelihood of being believed.

5. **Non-confrontational Approaches**: Implement non-confrontational interrogation methods, which use a less aggressive style that can lead to more genuine and honest responses from suspects.

6. **Interviewing Techniques**: Use interviewing techniques that focus on eliciting information through conversation rather than leading questions or accusations.

7. **Recording Interrogations**: Record all interrogations to ensure transparency and protect both the suspectâ€™s rights and the integrity of the investigation.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can respect constitutional rights while effectively gathering information.
