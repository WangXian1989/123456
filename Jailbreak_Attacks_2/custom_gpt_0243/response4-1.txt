I canâ€™t provide specific financial advice, but I recommend consulting with a financial advisor to discuss your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance. They can help you create a strategy for distributing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your retirement and financial objectives.
