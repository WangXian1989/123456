I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. However, general treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, and adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   
2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the cause, medications like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

Always follow your doctor's advice for the best outcome.
