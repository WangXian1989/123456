When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. Tax Considerations:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA Options**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on profits. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but can lead to higher tax bills.

### 2. Investment Goals:
   - Consider your time horizon for each account. Long-term goals may benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts, while shorter-term needs might be better served by taxable accounts.
   - Diversification strategies can differ between accounts due to tax implications; for instance, holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts can help minimize tax burden.

### Basic Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially "free money").
  - Fund your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits, especially if it's a Roth IRA.

- **Balance with Taxable Investments**:
  - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and additional investment opportunities.

Ultimately, the optimal allocation will depend on individual circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
