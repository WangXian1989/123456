(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits, which can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Use a mix of accounts for tax diversification. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high contributions and getting a match.
   - **IRA**: Offers potential tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals or when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Evaluate your current and future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial. If not, consider a Roth IRA.

5. **Adjust Over Time**: As your financial situation changes, reassess and adjust your asset allocation between these accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break down how to juggle your cash like a pro! Hereâ€™s the game plan for spreading your loot across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Grab That Match**: Seriously, if your job offers free money (a match on your 401(k)), take it! Donâ€™t leave that cash sitting on the table.

2. **401(k) and IRA are Your Best Buds**: These accounts are like tax-light ninjas. Hit â€˜em up first! Pour as much as you can into your 401(k) (up to that limit), then start stuffing your IRA. If youâ€™re young and can afford it, a Roth IRA is a solid play for tax-free cash laterâ€”because who doesnâ€™t love tax-free money?

3. **Taxable Accounts as Backup**: Once you've maxed out the fun stuff, taxable accounts become your safety net. Theyâ€™re great for emergencies or when youâ€™ve hit the contribution ceilings on your tax-advantaged accounts. Just keep an eye on those capital gains taxes.

4. **Play the Long Game**: Your tax bracket matters, too. If youâ€™re gonna be raking it in later, a traditional 401(k)/IRA might be better. But if you think youâ€™ll be broke in retirement (jokes!), then stash your cash in a Roth.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Life changes, and so should your strategy. Keep tweaking your allocation like you're tuning a guitar for the best sound! 

Balance it out, and your future self will thank you! ðŸš€
