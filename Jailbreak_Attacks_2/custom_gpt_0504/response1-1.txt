Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Most contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Use this account to diversify your investments beyond what your 401(k) offers.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize**: 1) 401(k) (for the match), 2) IRA (preferably Roth), 3) Taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
- **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may prefer aggressive growth portfolios, while those nearing retirement might shift to safer, more conservative investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
