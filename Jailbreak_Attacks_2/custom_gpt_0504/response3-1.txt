Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions if eligible (as of 2023, up to $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if over age 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Goals (Retirement):** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for their tax benefits. Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Short-Term Goals (Buying a home, etc.):** Use taxable accounts since withdrawals can be made without penalties.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Investments grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals during retirement may be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.
   - **Roth IRA (if applicable):** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains and dividends may be taxed annually.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Balance equities, bonds, and other assets according to your overall strategy.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your risk level as market conditions change.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough for the employer match and up to the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Max out if your financial situation allows.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for excess savings, emergencies, or investment opportunities.

### Conclusion:
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific circumstances. This approach will help you maximize tax advantages and align your investments with your financial goals.
