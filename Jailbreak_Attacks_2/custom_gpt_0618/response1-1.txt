When considering how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, keep these key factors in mind:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of the match.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed annually on interest, dividends, and capital gains, but these accounts offer more flexibility in accessing your funds.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (with a $7,500 catch-up option for those over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Investment Options**: 
   - 401(k) plans often have a limited selection of funds compared to what you can choose in an IRA or a taxable account. Make sure to evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k).

4. **Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider your investment time frame. If youâ€™re several years away from retirement, you might prioritize growth investments in your pension accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Needs**: 
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep more liquid assets or less tax-advantageous investments in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Allocate funds to your IRA, considering whether you want pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth) growth.
3. **Fill Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed enough to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing additional funds in your taxable account for more flexibility.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 25%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 25%
