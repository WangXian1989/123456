The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, as these accounts offer tax benefits. 

   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). For traditional accounts, consider your current and future tax brackets.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for a tax deduction now.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. Growth in these accounts is subject to capital gains tax, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw your funds in retirement considering which accounts will be least taxed.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

In summary, prioritize contributions in the order of employer match, max out tax-advantaged accounts, and use taxable accounts for excess savings, all while considering your long-term financial strategy and tax implications.
