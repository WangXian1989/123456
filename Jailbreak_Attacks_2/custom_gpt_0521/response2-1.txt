Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Generally tax-deferred; contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or made with after-tax money (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested after-tax income; you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: Depending on your income and tax filing status, contribute to your IRA next, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional funds in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Base your allocation on your risk tolerance and how long you have until retirement. Younger investors might take more risks.
   - **Tax Considerations**: 
     - Hold high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Place lower-growth, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial situation. 

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of withdrawal rules and potential penalties before 59½ for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 6. **Consult Financial Advisors**
   - If you feel uncertain, consult with a financial advisor for tailored strategies based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 60% of contributions (up to company match)
- **IRA**: 30% of contributions (split between Traditional and Roth based on tax situation)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% of contributions for more liquidity and flexibility.

This structured approach will help you balance growth and tax efficiency while preparing for retirement.
