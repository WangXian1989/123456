Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on various factors. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred, often with employer matching contributions. Limits on withdrawals until retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - Traditional IRA: Tax-deferred, taxed on withdrawal.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are taxed, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but you have flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - Determine your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals (e.g., buying a house, funding education).
   - Consider short-term vs. long-term needs.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Benefits**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRAs:** If eligible, maximize contributions to an IRA (both Traditional and Roth) after meeting the employer match.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments:
     - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
     - Hold bonds or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Diversify your portfolio across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account type to balance risk and return.

### 6. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts, prioritizing those with tax advantages first, then taxable accounts as needed.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your accounts annually. Rebalance your portfolio as your investment performance and financial goals evolve.

### Sample Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough for the employer match, then max out IRA contributions.
- **IRA:** Use for additional tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account:** Use for short-term savings or investments that complement your retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy according to your unique situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights and ensure adherence to IRS rules regarding contributions and withdrawals.
