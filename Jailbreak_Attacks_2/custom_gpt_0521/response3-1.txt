Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, such as your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling. No contribution limits, but investment decisions affect your tax liability.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Medium-term needs**: Consider a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs.
   - **Long-term retirement goals**: Focus on maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid needs and for managing annual tax liabilities (like capital gains).

### 4. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (it’s free money).
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you can (consider a Roth for tax-free withdrawals if eligible).
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Choose funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Diversify between stocks, bonds, and other assets, tailoring to your investment strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation according to market conditions, lifestyle changes, and financial goals.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution
1. **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match (e.g., 5% of your salary).
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds for liquidity and investments with favorable tax options.

### Conclusion
Overall, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits while keeping a portion of your investments in taxable accounts for flexibility. Regularly review your strategy to adapt to changes in your financial situation and goals.
