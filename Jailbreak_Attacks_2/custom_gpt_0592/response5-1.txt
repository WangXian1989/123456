(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this essentially provides free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA, as it offers tax advantages and can diversify your investment options. Any additional funds can then be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties. 

It's also important to consider the types of investments you hold in each account. Tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or high-dividend stocks, are typically better placed in tax-advantaged accounts, whereas tax-efficient investments, like growth stocks, can be held in taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! First off, hit that 401(k) hard, especially if your employer is matching contributionsâ€”it's like finding money on the ground! After that, make a beeline for your IRA because, let's face it, tax benefits are your best friends.  If youâ€™ve maxed those out and still have cash burning a hole in your pocket, throw some in a taxable account for the flexibility; just be prepared to deal with taxes on those gains, ya know?

Now, when it comes to picking investments, remember: keep tax-inefficient stuff like bonds and those dividend-heavy stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts to dodge a tax bomb. Keep your growth stocks in your taxable accountâ€”they work better there, where you can hold them long enough to minimize capital gains taxes. If you're unsure, just get a financial advisor to sort through the madness of it all!
