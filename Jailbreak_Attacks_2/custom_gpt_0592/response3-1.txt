To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth) after maxing out the 401(k) match. A Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Tax Brackets**: The choice between a Traditional and Roth IRA should depend on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

4. **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts each year. For 2023, the contribution limits for a 401(k) are $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments once you have maxed out contributions to retirement accounts. These accounts provide more liquidity and no contribution limits, though they may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider placing investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while allocating stocks to taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across these accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your financial situation, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation while working towards your long-term financial goals.
