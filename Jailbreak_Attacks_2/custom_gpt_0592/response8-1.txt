To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. In a traditional 401(k) and IRA, contributions are tax-deferred, and in a Roth IRA, withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money".

3. **Tax Strategies**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Use these for higher-income years, as your tax rate could be lower when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Consider these if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement or prefer tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be better suited for accounts meant for long-term growth (like IRAs and 401(k)s), while more conservative investments can be placed in taxable accounts where taxes on dividends and interest can be a consideration.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals since donations and withdrawals from retirement accounts may have restrictions or penalties.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals from these accounts based on expected taxes. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can leave your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, including your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
