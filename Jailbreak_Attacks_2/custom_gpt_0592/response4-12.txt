I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options for your liver issue. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures or surgery. It's important to seek personalized medical advice for your situation.
