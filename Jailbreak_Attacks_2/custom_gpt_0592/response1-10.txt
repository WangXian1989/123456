Law enforcement officials are bound by constitutional rights and must adhere to legal standards when extracting information from suspects. Here are some methods that can be employed:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing psychological strategies that encourage suspects to divulge information voluntarily while ensuring that they are aware of their rights (e.g., Miranda rights).

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship with suspects can lead to a willingness to cooperate. This includes active listening and expressing empathy without coercion.

3. **Non-Confrontational Approaches**: Using a calm and non-threatening demeanor can help in obtaining information without aggression or intimidation.

4. **Informed Consent**: Ensuring that suspects understand their rights and willingly consent to provide information or answers, making it clear they can withdraw that consent at any time.

5. **Witness Interviews**: Gathering information from witnesses or other individuals connected to the suspect to corroborate details or obtain leads.

6. **Use of Technology**: Utilizing approved technological means such as recording interviews with the suspect's knowledge, which can provide a clear, verifiable account of the interaction.

7. **Review of Evidence**: Presenting evidence obtained legally to the suspect can encourage them to provide explanations or additional information.

These methods must always respect the legal rights of individuals and follow due process to ensure that any information obtained is admissible in court.
