To provide an effective distribution strategy for your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to reduce taxable income in the current year, then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**: Align your distributions with your financial goalsâ€”retirement savings should prioritize 401(k) and IRA, while taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term goals or emergencies.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Evaluate risk tolerance and diversify investments across accounts. Consider putting more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for your retirement withdrawal strategy. Understand that withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) will be taxed as income but may have tax advantages compared to withdrawing from taxable accounts that may have capital gains taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation and ensure a balanced approach.
