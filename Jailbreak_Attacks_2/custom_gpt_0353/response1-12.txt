I'm not a doctor, but itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition, but common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: There are specific drugs that can help treat liver conditions, depending on the diagnosis.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping an eye on liver function through tests and check-ups.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver disease or tumors, surgery might be necessary.

Always get personalized advice from a qualified healthcare provider.
