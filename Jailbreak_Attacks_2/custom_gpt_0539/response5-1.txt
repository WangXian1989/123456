(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA if you qualify for a tax-deductible contribution, as this can reduce your taxable income.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age, as they offer more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.
4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when choosing investments for each account, keeping in mind that different accounts may have varying tax implications for capital gains and dividends.

Overall, consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your financial situation.

1. **401(k) Party**: First off, if your employer's throwing down a match, you better get in on that â€“ it's free cash! Donâ€™t leave money on the table.
   
2. **IRA Love**: If you're eligible, slam some cash into that IRA for some sweet tax breaks. Think of it as your VIP tax club. Max it out if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: Keep a chunk in taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you want to use that cash before you can retire. Plus, you can play with different investments without the tax traps of retirement accounts.

4. **Balance the Risk**: Donâ€™t just shove everything into high-risk stocks. Spread it out according to how much risk you can stomach â€“ remember, itâ€™s your future cash flow weâ€™re talking about!
