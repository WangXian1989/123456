Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match – it's essentially free money. If financially feasible, try to max out contributions (limit for 2023 is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50). Roth IRAs have tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions depending on your income.

2. **Assess Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for assets expected to grow significantly or generate high taxable income, like bonds or dividend-producing stocks.
   - Place investments with lower potential returns, such as cash equivalents, in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced approach across accounts to diversify your investments. Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals considering which accounts may incur taxes and at what rates. Taxable accounts can be a good source for early withdrawals due to favorable capital gains treatment.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on life changes, market conditions, or retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
