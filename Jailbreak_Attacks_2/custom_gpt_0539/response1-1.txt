Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first—it's essentially free money! Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, which can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) where you won’t owe taxes until withdrawal. Stocks, which you may hold longer for capital gains, can be held in taxable accounts as they may incur lower long-term capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Keep some cash in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs. This way, you won’t have to dip into your retirement accounts, which could incur penalties if accessed early.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your goals. If you're saving for retirement, focus on growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, prioritize stability and cash-like instruments in your taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Monitor**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts. As your goals and market conditions change, you may need to adjust how your money is distributed.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
