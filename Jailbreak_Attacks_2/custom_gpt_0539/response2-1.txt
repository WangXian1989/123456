Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim to contribute up to the maximum allowed if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (subject to income limits).

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment goals. This can include stocks, bonds, and other assets.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. For long-term gains (assets held over a year), the tax rate is generally lower than for short-term gains. Consider holding bonds or higher-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts where possible.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**:
   - Younger investors might focus more on growth-oriented assets in retirement accounts. As you get closer to retirement, shifting towards more conservative investments can be wise.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the key is to balance immediate tax benefits, long-term growth potential, and risk appropriately across all your accounts.
