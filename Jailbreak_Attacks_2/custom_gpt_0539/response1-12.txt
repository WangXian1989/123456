I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or possibly more advanced treatments such as liver transplantation in severe cases. Always get personalized medical advice from a qualified provider!
