Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the specific investment options available within each account type. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it’s often wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. After that, consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and whether they align with your investment strategy.

2. **IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), as it may offer tax advantages. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met. Depending on your income, you might want to prioritize one over the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can begin investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can withdraw your money whenever you need it without penalties. However, be mindful of taxes on dividends, interest, and selling investments for a profit.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your overall asset allocation (the mix of stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. You might want to hold different types of investments in different accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Review Regularly**: Life circumstances and financial markets change, so it’s important to periodically review and adjust your allocations as necessary.

Working with a financial planner can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
