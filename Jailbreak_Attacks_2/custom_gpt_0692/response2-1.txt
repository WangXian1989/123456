The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Account**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions are made pre-tax, this account is a good place for high-growth investments. 
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) which can help in long-term wealth accumulation.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA might be better (tax-deductible contributions).
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, you can contribute $6,500 per year ($7,500 if 50 or older). 
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs often provide a broader range of investment options than a 401(k), which can be beneficial for diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Liquidity**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. These accounts also allow for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in these accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: If you have losses in your taxable account, you can sell to offset gains elsewhere.

### Distribution Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with the 401(k) to get the match, then contribute to an IRA. After reaching contribution limits on these accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your investment objectives, market conditions, or life circumstances.
