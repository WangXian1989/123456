When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction for contributions.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxes**: Taxable accounts may be more suitable for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across your accounts. This can help manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to draw from these accounts in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while IRAs and 401(k)s may have restrictions.

It may also be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
