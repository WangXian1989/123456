The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, prioritize contributing to tax-deferred accounts like a Traditional IRA or 401(k).
   - If you think your tax rate will be higher in the future, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous as you pay taxes on contributions now, allowing for tax-free growth.

3. **Diversification of Withdrawals:**
   - Having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts allows you flexibility in retirement for tax-efficient withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on any growth.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly assess your accounts and investments to ensure they're aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
