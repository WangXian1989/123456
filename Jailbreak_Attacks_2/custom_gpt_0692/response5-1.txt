Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your circumstances). Once you have maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: The type of accounts you use may depend on your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA could be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free, whereas traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Investment Choices**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that have long-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals**: As you age or as your financial situation changes, you may want to shift the allocation of your investments among these accounts. Plan for withdrawals in retirement keeping tax implications in mind.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution to your unique situation.
