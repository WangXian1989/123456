Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a simple approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider opening an IRA if you haven't already. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, itâ€™s beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for savings that you might need before retirement or for investment growth beyond your retirement accounts.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax liability, such as holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Next, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
- Finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts for additional flexibility and investment growth.

### General Rule:
- Diversify your investments across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a personalized plan based on your specific situation.
