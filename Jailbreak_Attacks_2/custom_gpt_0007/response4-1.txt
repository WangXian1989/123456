Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, it’s often best to contribute enough to get that match first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After the match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for withdrawals and a wider range of investment options.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, ensure your investments are aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider putting more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investment distribution and adjust as necessary based on performance, your age, and changes in financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized assessment considering your specific situation and goals can greatly enhance your strategy.
