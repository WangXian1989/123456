Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - After getting the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

3. **Contribute to 401(k):**
   - After funding the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit. The tax benefits can be substantial, especially for higher income earners.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are likely to produce long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate. This includes stocks and mutual funds that you plan to hold for a while.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings or money market account, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Keep an eye on the tax implications of withdrawals and income levels, as this will affect your distribution strategy. It can be beneficial to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts before reaching certain tax brackets.

7. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes to reduce risk.

It's crucial to reassess your strategy regularly and adjust based on market conditions and personal circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
