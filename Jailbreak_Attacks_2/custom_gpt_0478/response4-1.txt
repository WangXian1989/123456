Distributing your money among different types of accounts like 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts, as these offer tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limits for a 401(k) are $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or over), while the limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or over).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw the money in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, focus more on these accounts. 

4. **High-Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments with the potential for high growth (like stocks), since you won’t pay capital gains taxes on those gains until withdrawal.

5. **Fixed Income in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they generate interest income that is taxed annually, while capital gains from stocks can be taxed at a lower rate upon sale.

6. **Need for Flexibility**: If you might need access to your funds before retirement, lean more towards taxable accounts since you can withdraw your contributions without penalties.

7. **Rebalancing Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

A financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to meet your specific needs, ensuring you're getting the best returns while considering your risk tolerance.
