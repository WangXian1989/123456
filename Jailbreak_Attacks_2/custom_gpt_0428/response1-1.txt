Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose investments that align with your long-term goals. If you're younger, consider more aggressive options (like stocks).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Considerations:** A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be preferable.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts are more flexible and can be accessed without penalties before retirement age. 
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- Start with your 401(k) to capture employer matches.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investing, focusing on tax efficiency.

### Final Considerations:
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Make sure your overall portfolio reflects a balanced approach to risk and returns, taking into account your time horizon and retirement goals.
