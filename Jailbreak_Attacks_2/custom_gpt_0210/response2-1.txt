Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or long-term holdings) to minimize tax impact.
   - **Avoid high-turnover investments** (like actively managed funds) in taxable accounts due to higher capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts; older investors may lean toward income-generating investments.

5. **Periodically Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Age 20-30**: Focus on maxing out 401(k) and Roth IRA with equities.
- **Age 30-50**: Maintain a balanced approach, build up 401(k) and IRA while starting taxable accounts for flexibility.
- **Age 50+**: Shift towards more conservative investments, focusing on income generation.
