Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax advantages. A Roth IRA, where contributions are made post-tax, can be especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. ** taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that provide lower tax burdens, such as long-term capital gains or tax-efficient funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified asset mix across all accounts, adjusting based on your overall risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment distribution and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.
