When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a Roth 401(k) option.
   - **IRA:** After meeting the employer match, consider maxing out an IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax benefits, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals during retirement will be taxed.
   - Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, younger investors can take on more risk, focusing on growth investments in their retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift toward more stable, income-generating assets.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account. This should ideally cover 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. Be mindful of capital gains tax and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within accounts to manage risk.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and investment performance to ensure they align with your goals.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
