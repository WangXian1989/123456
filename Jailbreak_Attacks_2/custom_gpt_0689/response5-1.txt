(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA because they can provide tax benefits either in the contributions phase or during withdrawals. You might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Any remaining funds can be placed in a taxable account, where you should be mindful of tax implications related to capital gains.

After that, consider whether to go for a traditional or Roth IRAâ€”traditional means you might get taxed later, while Roth is tax-free in retirement (if your income allows). Once you've maxed that out, toss whatever's left into your taxable account. Just keep an eye on taxes; you donâ€™t want Uncle Sam sneaking up on you! Overall, play the long game with the tax-advantaged stuff, then let that taxable account work for you in the meantime. Get your money to work smarter, not harder!
