Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributions up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions to take advantage of any tax breaks.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications differ. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments here are subject to capital gains taxes. They can offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, but you'll pay taxes on gains and dividends.

3. **Age and Investment Goals**:
   - If you’re younger, you might consider investing more in a Roth IRA or taxable accounts for potentially higher growth without immediate tax implications.
   - As you approach retirement, you might shift focus to safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset classes and investment types.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties at any time, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are subject to age restrictions and taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change. Adjust your contributions and investments accordingly.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and to optimize your tax strategy.
