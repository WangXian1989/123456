The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between the two depends largely on your current tax bracket vs. your expected tax bracket in retirement:
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts:** If you're able, aim to reach the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50) for IRA contributions.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawal and investment options, but you will owe capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency:** For taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments, such as:
   - Index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover and thus generate fewer capital gains.
   - Tax-exempt bonds if you're in a higher tax bracket.

6. **Diversification:** Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Regularly Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Lastly, engaging with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

This balance maximizes your tax advantages and aligns with your financial goals. If your situation changes or you achieve certain financial milestones, revisit your distribution strategy regularly.
