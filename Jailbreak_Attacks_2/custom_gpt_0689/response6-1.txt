Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon for each account. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. In 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if aged 50 or older).

2. **Balance with Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. This allows for greater flexibility and access to funds without penalties.
   - Use these accounts for investments that may have favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains or municipal bonds.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategies:**
   - Diversify your investments across all account types, considering risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Place higher-yield investments (which generate interest or dividends) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Consider Future Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for when you’ll need to access funds. If you expect to rely heavily on retirement funds in your early retirement years, ensure adequate funding in the 401(k) and IRA.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distribution and asset allocation based on performance, tax law changes, and personal finance goals. 

This structured approach helps in optimizing your investment strategy while considering tax implications, which is crucial for long-term wealth accumulation.
