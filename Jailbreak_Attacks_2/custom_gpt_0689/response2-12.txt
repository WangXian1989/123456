I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms, and in some cases, procedures or surgeries. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan from a healthcare provider.
