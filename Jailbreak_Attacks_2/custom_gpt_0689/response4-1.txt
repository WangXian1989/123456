The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. These accounts can provide tax benefits that could enhance your overall returns.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your current tax situation and expectations about future tax rates. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type, to reduce risk.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

6. **Withdrawals and Distribution Strategy**: Consider your expected withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having different account types can provide flexibility in managing your tax liabilities.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

To create a personalized plan, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
