Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves a few considerations to balance growth, tax benefits, and accessibility. Here’s a concise approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer match, typically has higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages vary between traditional (tax deductible, taxed upon withdrawal) and Roth (taxed now, tax-free upon withdrawal).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access, but taxed on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

### 2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term (liquidity) and long-term (retirement) needs.
   - If you’re aiming for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider maxing out if possible.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold higher growth or volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Consider your tax bracket now vs. retirement to determine IRA type.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and life changes.

### Conclusion:
Overall, a common strategy is to max out your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and lastly allocate funds to your taxable accounts based on remaining financial goals and liquidity needs. Seeking advice from a financial advisor can also tailor strategies to your specific circumstances.
