Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, timeline, and current tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement; otherwise, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth if you qualify.
  
2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing, typically 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can generally hold investments that may generate higher taxable income (e.g., bonds) to avoid taxes during accumulation.
   - In taxable accounts, consider using low-turnover investments (like index funds) that produce fewer capital gains, as these will be taxed.

4. **Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize retirement accounts. For medium-term goals (like buying a house in 5-10 years), you might balance between these accounts and taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, keeping in mind your risk tolerance and changing goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (enough to maximize employer match).
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Aim to max out ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional investment funds here, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

### Consult a Professional
For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

By diversifying your investments in this way, you can utilize the benefits of each account type while working toward your financial goals.
