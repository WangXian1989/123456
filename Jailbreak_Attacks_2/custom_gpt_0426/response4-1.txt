Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. The contribution limits for 401(k)s are higher than IRAs. Focus on maxing this out if you're in a lower tax bracket now versus retirement.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is more advantageous. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Prioritize maxing out contributions in a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at lower rates. 

**Balancing Tips**:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have some liquidity for emergencies outside of retirement accounts.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Invest in assets with growth potential within tax-advantaged accounts where tax impacts on growth can be minimized.
- **Asset Location**: Place higher-taxed investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and lower-taxed investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.
