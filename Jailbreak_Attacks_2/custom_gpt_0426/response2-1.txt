Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for tax efficiency and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Accounts by Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement but are funded with after-tax dollars. Consider your income level for eligibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are funded with after-tax dollars and may not provide upfront tax benefits, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts First**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, focusing on employer match and tax advantages. The contribution limits vary, so check current limits (e.g., 2024 limits are $23,000 for 401(k) under 50, $6,500 for IRA under 50).

### 3. **Allocate Investments Based on Goals**
   - **Long-term (Retirement)**: For 401(k) and IRA, consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Short-term (Liquidity Needs)**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts since those can be accessed without penalties before retirement age.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocations and contributions as you approach retirement. Adjust based on changing income, tax situations, or market conditions.

### Summary
Maximize tax-advantaged contributions first, diversify investments by account type, and remain flexible for future adjustments. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific goals and circumstances.
