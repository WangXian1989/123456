Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can afford, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts can provide flexibility and access when needed but will incur taxes on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement plans.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
