To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Impact**:
   - Prioritize higher contributions to accounts with immediate tax benefits (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Make additional contributions to taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement or wish to have a diversified investment strategy.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment choices available within each account type, as they can differ significantly. Opt for lower-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.
   - Diversify your holdings across all accounts to mitigate risks.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio’s performance and rebalance as necessary to align with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - Tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts can offset capital gains and lower your tax bill.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can maximize your investment potential while minimizing your tax obligations over time.
