(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account, such as your current tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and an IRA first, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to capture the full match. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** If you can, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction in the year of contribution.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Lastly, consider taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, allowing for withdrawals without penalties.

Balancing your contributions will depend on your specific financial situation, so it may be beneficial to seek out financial advice tailored to your circumstances.
