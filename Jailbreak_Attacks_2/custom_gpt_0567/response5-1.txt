(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." If you can, aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as this offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) if you qualify. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose the one that aligns with your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age. Keep in mind, funds in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so focus on tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First things first â€” if your employerâ€™s throwing cash your way with a match, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab it! Max out that 401(k) if you can. Itâ€™s tax-deferred, so youâ€™re basically stashing money away for retirement while dodging those taxes now; itâ€™s a no-brainer!

2. **IRA**: Next up, the IRA. If you qualify, dive into that Roth or Traditional IRA. Go Roth if you think your tax rate will be higher in the future, because tax-free growth is a beautiful thing, my friend. Otherwise, grab that Traditional for some sweet deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, when the retirement funds are rolling in, itâ€™s time to look at taxable accounts for those other goals, like a beach house or that dream car (or whatever floats your boat). Just keep in mind the tax implications with capital gains, so try to stay smart about the investments you pick.

Remember, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all. Adjust based on your life goals, risk tolerance, and maybe even get some pro advice for that extra edge!
