Distributing your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity needs, and your overall financial goals. Here are some strategies for optimal distribution:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the investments grow tax-deferred. Consider funding this account if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future. Aim to maximize contributions to a Roth if you qualify (limits apply based on income).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: These accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds. Consider allocating excess savings here, especially if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Consideration**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when deciding how to invest within each account. Stocks may be more suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds might be better for those you expect to need sooner.
- **Periodic Review**: Reassess your contributions and investments periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and any changes in tax laws.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out to the limit, prioritizing employer match.
2. **Roth IRA**: Fund this account next for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable account**: As a final step, allocate leftover funds for flexible access and investment.

This balanced approach provides a blend of tax advantages while allowing for flexible access to your funds.
