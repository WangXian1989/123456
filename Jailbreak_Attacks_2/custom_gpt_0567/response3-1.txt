Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some key considerations to help you decide:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers taxable income. Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: There are traditional IRAs (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and Roth IRAs (contributions are after-tax, withdrawals are tax-free if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can be sold for capital gains taxes. Flexibility to withdraw without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating more funds elsewhere.

3. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize contributing to accounts with tax advantages (e.g., 401(k) and IRAs) before funding taxable accounts.
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversification & Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments in each account align with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy. Keep an eye on asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Time Horizon**: If you plan to access money in the near term, consider keeping those funds in a taxable account to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix may give you more flexibility to manage taxes in retirement.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor who can assess your unique situation and help create a tailored distribution strategy.

By structuring your contributions thoughtfully across these accounts, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
