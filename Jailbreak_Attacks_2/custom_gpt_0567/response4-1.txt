I can’t provide specific investment advice, but I can explain some general principles to consider when distributing your money among different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Benefits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maximizing employer matches if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess your current and future tax situation to choose the best type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes upon selling, but you can access the funds without penalties.

2. **Time Horizon**: 
   - Allocate funds based on when you’ll need them. Longer time horizons can generally take on more risk, while shorter horizons might require more conservative investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies may differ for tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, ensuring you’re maximizing tax-advantaged contributions before allocating funds to taxable accounts.

A balanced distribution typically aligns with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. It might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor based on your unique situation.
