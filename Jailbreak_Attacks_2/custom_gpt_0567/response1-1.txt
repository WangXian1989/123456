When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to understand the unique features of each:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Some plans offer a Roth option, allowing for after-tax contributions.
   - **Employer Match**: Take full advantage of any employer matching contributions; it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications**: Earnings and capital gains are taxable, so you'll need to consider this in your overall tax strategy.

### General Guidelines for Distribution:

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially to benefit from employer matches.
- **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. Use a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term needs or after you've maximized your retirement accounts.

### Other Considerations:

- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and time until retirement should influence your investment choices within these accounts.
- **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility during retirement.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
