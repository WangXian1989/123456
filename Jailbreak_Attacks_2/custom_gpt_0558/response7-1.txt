When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth in retirement, while a traditional IRA gives you tax-deferred growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investments that may yield more frequent capital gains or dividends, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income depending on your tax bracket.

3. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. This helps ensure that you're not overexposed to any single asset class.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) and consider keeping less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals: starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow, then tapping into tax-deferred accounts, and finally, withdrawing from Roth accounts last.

6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice that considers your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance, consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your needs.

This balanced approach helps optimize your returns while managing taxes effectively.
