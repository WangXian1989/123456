Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
- **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
- **Short-Term Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for liquidity and access.

### 2. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is "free money."
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) depending on eligibility and tax implications.

### 3. Tax Considerations
- **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Good if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher bracket later.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider the capital gains tax implications. Dividends and interest are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or growth-oriented mutual funds.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and tax-efficient funds. Consider tax-managed or index funds to minimize taxable distributions.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
- Monitor the performance and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and market changes.

### 6. Consult with a Financial Advisor
A personalized strategy is crucial. An advisor can help align your investment strategy with your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Maximize up to employer match; aim for around 15% of your salary.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount each year.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds for flexibility and investment growth, focusing on tax-efficient strategies.

This approach can help you build a diversified portfolio while optimizing tax efficiency for both short-term and long-term financial goals.
