Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, liquidity needs, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth with taxes on withdrawals).
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum limit if possible. 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity:** Use these accounts for short-term goals or emergencies since you can withdraw without penalties.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Consider investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or tax-efficient mutual funds.

### 4. **Considerations for Distribution**
   - **Retirement Horizon:** Younger investors might prioritize tax-deferred accounts, while those nearing retirement may want to balance liquid assets.
   - **Tax Bracket Management:** Withdraw funds in a way that keeps you in a lower tax bracket, particularly during retirement.

### Conclusion
- Balance your contributions based on your tax situation and retirement timeline.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation evolves.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
