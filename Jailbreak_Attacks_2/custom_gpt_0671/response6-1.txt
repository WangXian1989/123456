To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits. Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for these accounts. For 2023, it's $22,500 for 401(k)s ($30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Place Growth-Oriented Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Stocks and other high-growth investments should be kept in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - **Hold Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Bonds and dividend-paying stocks can be held in taxable accounts since they may incur taxes when realized, but tax-advantaged accounts can shield them from immediate tax liability.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts align with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across asset classes in each account to mitigate risks.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement based on tax implications. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution to facilitate growth, minimize tax liabilities, and achieve your financial goals.
