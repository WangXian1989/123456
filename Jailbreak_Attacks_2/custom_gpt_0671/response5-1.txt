(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a common approach:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free" money.
2. **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction in the year you contribute.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into taxable investment accounts. These accounts give you more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
