To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider maxing out your contribution limit if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** In a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, involves after-tax contributions, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Choose based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings on investments in these accounts are taxed in the year they are realized (capital gains, dividends, interest). Use these accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for higher-risk investments that might generate short-term gains.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals, whether it’s saving for retirement, funding education, or other long-term objectives. 
   - Consider risk tolerance and investment time horizon: longer terms might allow for more aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while taxable accounts might need a more conservative approach.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your allocation among the accounts, adjusting based on performance or changes in financial goals and current market conditions.

5. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - It’s generally wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts since they can help grow your savings quicker due to tax benefits.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in accessible accounts (like a savings account) before fully committing funds to retirement accounts.

Engaging with a financial advisor can also help tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation and financial goals.
