The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) if you qualify, as these accounts offer tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA) upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments that generate little income or long-term gains here.

3. **Investment Goals**: Identify your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or accessible funds and focus on longer-term investments in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, while using other vehicles for different types of assets.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Review your portfolio periodically and rebalance as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, tax law, and market conditions.

Before making specific decisions, consulting with a financial advisor can help customize a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
