To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers employer matching contributions, allowing you to save pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income. Feasible for high contribution limits ($19,500 in 2021, $26,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages either through traditional IRAs (pre-tax contributions) or Roth IRAs (post-tax contributions). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k) ($6,000 or $7,000 if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not have contribution limits or tax advantages. Earnings are taxed as they are realized, including dividends and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match (if available); this is essentially “free money/returns.”
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA (especially if you can fund a Roth IRA, which has tax-free growth).
   - If you have additional funds to invest after maxing your 401(k) and IRA, divert those into your taxable account.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Depending on your risk tolerance and investment strategy, diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account. 
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts typically are intended for long-term growth and can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

4. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Understand the tax implications of each account type. For example, holding bonds (which emit taxable interest) in tax-advantaged accounts protects you from current taxation.
   - For taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs (if qualified) can be withdrawn tax-free. 

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your asset allocation as your financial situation or market conditions change. 

This balanced approach helps you maximize both tax advantages and growth potential across various account types.
