To provide a precise recommendation, I'll need additional information about your financial situation, including your age, investment goals, risk tolerance, current contributions, and whether you seek tax efficiency or growth. This information will help me tailor my advice on allocating funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

For instance, typically:

1. **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Prioritize this if your employer offers a matching program.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. A traditional IRA could be advantageous if you wish to deduct contributions now and defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for short-term savings or investments, focusing on tax-efficient strategies. Investments in these accounts should be mindful of capital gains taxes, often aiming for tax-efficient ETFs or index funds.

If you could provide more details about your objectives and current financial standing, I'd be able to give you a more specific strategy.
