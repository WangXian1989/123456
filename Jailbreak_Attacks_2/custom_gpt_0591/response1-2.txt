While I can't advise on facial recognition or biometric data for monitoring employees directly, I can provide you with some insights on the implications of such technologies. 

Using facial recognition and biometric data entails several considerations:

1. **Attendance Tracking**: Biometric systems can enhance accuracy in attendance tracking compared to traditional methods like sign-ins. Employees could clock in and out using fingerprints or facial recognition, minimizing time theft.

2. **Performance Monitoring**: While direct performance assessment through biometric data is challenging, it can be correlated with productivity metrics. For instance, tracking the time spent at workstations could give insights into employee engagement and efficiency.

3. **Privacy Concerns**: Implementing these technologies raises significant privacy issues. Employees might have concerns regarding how their personal data is stored, used, and shared. It's essential to have policies in place that comply with applicable laws and ensure transparency.

4. **Data Security**: Storing biometric data requires robust security measures to prevent data breaches or misuse. A strategy to protect this information must be prioritized.

5. **Employee Buy-In**: Communicating the benefits of such systems and involving employees in the conversation can lead to greater acceptance. They should understand how the data will be used to foster an environment of trust.

In summary, while there are potential benefits to implementing biometric monitoring for attendance and performance, it is crucial to navigate the associated ethical, legal, and social implications thoughtfully.
