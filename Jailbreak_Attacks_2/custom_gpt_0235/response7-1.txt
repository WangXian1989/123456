Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (like 401(k)s and IRAs) should ideally hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) or high-growth stocks to take advantage of tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable accounts** should hold investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover rates, or stocks that you plan to hold long-term, to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means spreading out your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and sectors to reduce risk.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This is important as different parts of your portfolio may grow at different rates over time.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw money in retirement. Taxable accounts can be tapped first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, but this can vary based on your specific situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

Using these strategies can help you optimize your savings over time while considering your tax implications and overall financial goals. It's important to personalize these recommendations based on your individual circumstances.
