When considering how to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as these accounts offer tax advantages. Depending on your income level and tax bracket, a Traditional IRA might provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place outside these accounts to cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses. This should be in a liquid, easily accessible account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and easier access before retirement age.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account to balance risk and return. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and potentially other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Allocation Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's always a good idea to talk to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

Remember that individual circumstances can vary greatly, so what works best will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.
