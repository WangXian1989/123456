I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems, as they can vary based on the specific condition and its severity. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or potentially surgery, depending on the issue. Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight can be beneficial as well. Please reach out to your doctor for personalized advice.
