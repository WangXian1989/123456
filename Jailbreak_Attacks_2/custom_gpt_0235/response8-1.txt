To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out annual contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, whereas a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that can benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates (like stocks) since you'll pay taxes on dividends and short-term gains at your regular income rate.
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on the interest earned.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, while also adhering to the tax considerations mentioned above.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Over time, as your investments grow, their relative shares may shift. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your desired asset allocation.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - As you approach retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize tax impact. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and save tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for later withdrawal.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and financial goals.
