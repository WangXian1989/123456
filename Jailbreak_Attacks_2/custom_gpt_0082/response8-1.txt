Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **401(k)**: Once the match is secured, contribute more if you can, especially if it has strong investment options and low fees.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains, as the tax rates on long-term gains are generally lower than ordinary income rates.
   - You can also keep more liquid, short-term investments here for flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio by diversifying across asset classes in all accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Keep higher-income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your allocation and adjust based on financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your life circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
