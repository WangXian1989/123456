The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages of these accounts can significantly enhance your growth potential. 

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, go back to fully funding your 401(k). This helps maximize your retirement savings and take advantage of tax deferrals.

4. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can then contribute to taxable investment accounts. These are beneficial for more immediate financial goals or if you want flexibility in accessing funds.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Depending on your tax situation, consider which investments to place in tax-advantaged accounts versus taxable accounts. For example, high-growth assets may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your complex financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs.

It’s important to tailor these strategies to fit your unique circumstances. Make sure to consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and any other financial goals you may have.
