When considering the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to follow a strategic approach that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some essential steps to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: A retirement account often with employer matching. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax-deferred growth. Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k), and you have options like a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Generally used for investing outside of retirement, subject to capital gains tax on profits, which can complicate your tax situation.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially to take advantage of any employer match in a 401(k).
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider the Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. If you're in a higher bracket now, the traditional IRA could be more beneficial.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments across accounts are diversified. Stocks may work well in taxable accounts due to lower capital gains rates, while stable investments might be better suited for retirement accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

### 4. Determine Contribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA, then return to your 401(k) for any additional retirement savings.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments to maintain liquidity.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth, minimize tax liabilities, and achieve financial independence more effectively. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation.
