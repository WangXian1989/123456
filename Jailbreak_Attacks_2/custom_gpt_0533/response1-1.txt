When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before heavily investing in other accounts.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals (since they are more flexible) and tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement goals.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments that generate capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate) here. Avoid holding high-dividend stocks in these accounts, as dividends are taxed as income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place investments expected to grow significantly, like stocks, in tax-deferred accounts to maximize growth without immediate taxation.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

These strategies can help you optimize your investment approach while considering tax implications and personal financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
