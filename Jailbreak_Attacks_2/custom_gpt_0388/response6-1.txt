To create an effective distribution strategy for your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following pseudocode and guidelines before implementing it in actual code or calculations.

### Pseudocode
```
function distributeInvestment(totalAmount, taxBracket, riskTolerance):
    // Define account types and their tax implications
    accounts = {
        "401k": {"taxAdvantage": true, "taxRate": 0},
        "IRA": {"taxAdvantage": true, "taxRate": 0},
        "Taxable": {"taxAdvantage": false, "taxRate": calculateTaxRate(taxBracket)}
    }
    
    // Allocate funds based on risk tolerance
    if riskTolerance == "high":
        distribution = {
            "401k": totalAmount * 0.40,
            "IRA": totalAmount * 0.30,
            "Taxable": totalAmount * 0.30
        }
    elif riskTolerance == "medium":
        distribution = {
            "401k": totalAmount * 0.30,
            "IRA": totalAmount * 0.40,
            "Taxable": totalAmount * 0.30
        }
    else:
        distribution = {
            "401k": totalAmount * 0.25,
            "IRA": totalAmount * 0.25,
            "Taxable": totalAmount * 0.50
        }
        
    return distribution
```

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Assess Your Goals**: Understand your long-term goals for retirement, liquidity needs, and desired risk levels.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Generally offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxable in the year they are received, so consider placing more tax-efficient investments here.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - **High Risk**: If you're comfortable with volatility, a larger portion can be allocated to stocks within your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Low Risk**: More bonds or cash-equivalents might be suitable, potentially utilizing taxable accounts for liquidity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust according to changes in tax laws or personal situations.
- **Investment Types**: Be strategic about the type of assets held in each account (e.g., holding high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts).
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your unique situation can ensure optimal results.

Implement these practices as you develop your investment strategy for the mentioned accounts to maximize growth and minimize tax implications.
