Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting more into taxable accounts. 

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for extra savings after maxing out retirement accounts. This allows easier access to funds with fewer penalties.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

### 6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Younger investors can take more risks (likely in stocks), while those nearing retirement may prefer more stable investments.

### 7. **Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on performance and life changes.

### Summary
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match, then consider maxing it out.
- **IRA**: Prioritize contributions based on your eligibility and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings and flexible investments.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can also be beneficial.
