To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributions up to the maximum annual limit, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - For higher earners, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income now.
   - For those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This may also be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments within each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
