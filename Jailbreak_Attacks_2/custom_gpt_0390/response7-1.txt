To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. 

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of growth-oriented investments (like stocks) and consider target-date funds that adjust risk over time.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, you might choose different investment strategies. Roth IRAs can be more growth-focused since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for withdrawals in retirement by considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly check and adjust your asset allocation in each account to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

This diversified approach can help optimize your retirement savings!
