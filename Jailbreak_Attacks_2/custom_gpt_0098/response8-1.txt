To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), consider your current and future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for funds you may need before retirement; be aware of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - Use your 401(k) for stable investments, focusing on long-term growth options.
   - Utilize IRAs for a mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance.
   - Allocate more volatile investments in taxable accounts, as you can control when to realize gains.

4. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies before heavily funding retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances and long-term objectives.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investments across all account types.
