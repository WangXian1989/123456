To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first due to tax benefits.
   - Take advantage of employer matching in your 401(k) if available.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments expected to generate high capital gains.
   - Hold less tax-efficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Align your investments with short-term versus long-term goals.
   - Allocate more to taxable accounts for short-term liquidity needs.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across asset classes in all account types.
   - Adjust your allocation based on risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
