Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Fill Up Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After securing the match, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth depending on your income and tax situation).
   - Subsequently, invest more into your 401(k) until you reach contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments, especially if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of the different tax implications for each account type when planning withdrawals.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your savings for both short-term and long-term growth.
