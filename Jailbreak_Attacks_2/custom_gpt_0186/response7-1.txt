Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 401(k)
- **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matches.
- **Investment Options:** Limited to what your employer offers; usually includes a mix of mutual funds and ETFs.
- **Withdrawal Rules:** Penalties for withdrawing before age 59½ unless certain conditions are met.

### IRA (Traditional or Roth)
- **Tax Treatment:**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Flexibility:** Generally offers a wider selection of investments compared to a 401(k).
- **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual limits and eligibility for Roth IRAs based on income.

### Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawals.
- **Tax Implications:** Gains are taxed, but long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from this.
- **Investment Strategy:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### Recommended Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, essentially "free money."
2. **Consider Tax Benefits:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial.
3. **Diversify Across Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds to your taxable account after maxing out retirement accounts. This gives you flexibility and access to your money without penalties.
4. **Regular Review:** Monitor your investments regularly and adjust your strategy based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that considers tax implications, contribution limits, and your unique financial situation is key. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
