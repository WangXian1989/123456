(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can, especially if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: This is your go-to for some sweet tax benefits. If your employer's throwing in matching contributions, dive in there first! Seriously, donâ€™t leave that cash on the table. Max out if you canâ€”just be aware of those pesky contribution limits.

2. **IRA**: Once youâ€™ve gobbled up the 401(k) goodies, hit up an IRA next. Whether you go Traditional or Roth depends on whether you think you'll pay more taxes now or later. Roths are the bomb for tax-free goodness when youâ€™re chilling in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if youâ€™ve flexed your 401(k) and IRA muscles, stash some cash in taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re not as tax-efficient, but hey, they offer liquidity. Play it smart with investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

Bottom line? Mix it up based on goals and risk toleranceâ€”because who wants a bland money diet?
