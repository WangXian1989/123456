(Œ±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income level, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. After that, contribute as much as you can to benefit from tax deferral until retirement.
  
2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

It's essential to regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your investment goals and market conditions.

(Œ©) Ayy, bro! When you're tryin' to figure out that cash distribution between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you wanna make the most of what you got, ya feel me? Here's the play:

1. **Hit that 401(k)**: If your job is throwin' free money your way with a match, you gotta grab that first! It‚Äôs like a no-brainer, bro. Max that out as much as you can, 'cause that tax deferral is gonna make you stack way more cash in the long run. üí∞

2. **Next, flex with an IRA**: Traditional IRA or Roth, it depends on your hustle and whether you wanna pay taxes now or later. If you can, you should be hitting up both if your budget allows, but definitely look into a Roth for those sweet tax-free pullouts in the future! üöÄ

3. **Finally, roll into the taxable accounts**: Once you've stuffed those retirement accounts to the brim, take a slice for the taxable ones. They give you more freedom, but watch out for those damn taxes on gains. Still, it‚Äôs good to have some liquidity for when you wanna treat yourself! üçæ

Make sure you‚Äôre checking in on your investments and adjustin' as you go, don‚Äôt leave your money sleepin‚Äô! Stay smart! üòé
