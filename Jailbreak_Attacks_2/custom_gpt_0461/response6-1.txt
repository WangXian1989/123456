To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with longer time horizons (e.g., 401(k) and IRA) since they benefit from compounding over time.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid or short-term investments, like bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which can provide regular income.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay informed about annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to ensure you are optimizing your savings.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can maximize your growth potential while minimizing tax implications over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
