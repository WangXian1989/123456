Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing this out if your employer offers a match. This account grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Investments here are more flexible but may be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Divide by Goal and Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (retirement), favor tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Factor in your current versus expected future tax rates when deciding where to allocate funds.

Always tailor your approach based on your financial goals, age, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
