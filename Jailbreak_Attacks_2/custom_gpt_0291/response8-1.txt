To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If available, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) for the tax benefits and potential employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, whereas traditional IRAs can provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may be subject to lower capital gains taxes or funds you may need access to before retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in liquid assets outside of your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio as needed based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific financial circumstances can provide optimal results.
