To provide tailored guidance on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'll need a little more information about your financial situation and goals. Here are some questions to consider:

1. **Investment Goals**: What are your short-term and long-term financial goals? Are you saving for retirement, a large purchase, or something else?
2. **Risk Tolerance**: How comfortable are you with taking risks in your investments? Would you prefer more stable investments, or are you open to higher-risk, higher-reward options?
3. **Tax Considerations**: Are there any specific tax strategies you're looking to implement? For example, are you concerned about current income tax rates impacting your investments?
4. **Current Age**: How old are you, and what is your expected timeline for retirement or accessing these funds?

Once I have this context, I can provide you with a more precise distribution strategy.
