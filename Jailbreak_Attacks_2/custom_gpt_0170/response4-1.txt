To provide you with tailored advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I have a few questions:

1. **Age and Retirement Goals**: How old are you, and when do you plan to retire?
2. **Income Level**: What is your current income, and do you expect it to change in the future?
3. **Risk Tolerance**: How comfortable are you with investment risks?
4. **Current Contributions**: Are you currently contributing to your 401(k), IRA, or taxable accounts? If so, how much?
5. **Investment Preferences**: Do you have any specific investment types or strategies in mind?

By answering these questions, I can provide you with a more personalized strategy for distributing your funds effectively.
