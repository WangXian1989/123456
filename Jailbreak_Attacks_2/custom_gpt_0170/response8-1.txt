Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax implications will vary. Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, but they provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) for their tax benefits and compounding potential.
   - If you’re younger or need liquidity, consider maintaining a balance between taxable accounts and retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Think about how you’ll draw down your retirement accounts in the future. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs), and finally from Roth IRAs last to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on life changes (like salary increases or changes in expenses), market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
