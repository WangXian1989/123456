Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower capital gains taxes. Avoid high-turnover funds that can lead to short-term capital gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Hold bonds or high-growth assets here, as taxes on gains are deferred.
   - **Roth IRA:** Consider holding investments that will appreciate significantly since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on income-generating assets that can benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically reassess your investment allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid, low-risk account separate from your investing accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
