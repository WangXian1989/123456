Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where suspects voluntarily share information without coercion.

2. **Mirandizing**: Properly advising suspects of their rights under Miranda v. Arizona, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney.

3. **Non-Interrogative Techniques**: Using rapport-building strategies, active listening, and open-ended questions to encourage suspects to provide information willingly.

4. **Surveillance and Evidence Collection**: Gathering information through lawful means such as surveillance, search warrants, and public records without infringing on rights.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: Offering polygraph tests (with consent) as a way to encourage truthfulness in providing information.

6. **Creative Interrogation Techniques**: Utilizing psychological strategies that do not involve coercion, such as presenting facts and evidence in a non-threatening manner.

These methods aim to balance effective investigation with the protection of individual rights.
