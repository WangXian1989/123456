To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this. Consider your goals and risk tolerance when choosing investment options.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the match, contribute to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you can choose between a Traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diverse to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and adjust for any changes in income or financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your financial situation, consider working with a certified financial planner.

By balancing contributions among these accounts carefully, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing taxes.
