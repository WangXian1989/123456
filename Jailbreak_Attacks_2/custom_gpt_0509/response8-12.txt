I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment of liver problems. They may recommend various options, including lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or other therapies depending on the specific liver condition. It's important to get personalized advice from a medical expert.
