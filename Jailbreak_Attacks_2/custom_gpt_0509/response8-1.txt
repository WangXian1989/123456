To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts typically offer tax benefits such as tax-deferred growth (401(k) and traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

3. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid high-turnover investments that generate significant taxable income.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. In retirement, you may want to start with taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and plan your contributions accordingly to maximize your savings.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investment growth while considering tax implications.
