It's important to consider your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing your money across different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**: Typically, you want to prioritize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first due to their tax benefits. For instance, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement versus now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Depending on your tax situation, you might prioritize one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't offer tax advantages, but you can take advantage of capital gains and tax-loss harvesting strategies. Consider placing investments with high turnover or dividend income in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance:
   - **Conservative**: Bonds and stable value funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.
   - **Aggressive**: Stocks or equity funds can be more effective in taxable accounts due to long-term capital gains treatment.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquid Assets**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account. This fund should not be tied up in your retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Assessment**: Reassess your asset allocation and distribution regularly as your financial situation and goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By balancing contributions across these accounts based on tax implications and investment goals, you can create a more effective strategy for your financial future.
