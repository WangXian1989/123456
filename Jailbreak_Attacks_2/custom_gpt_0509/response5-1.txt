(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Generally, you might prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first because they offer tax benefits that taxable accounts do not. 

Here's a basic breakdown:
1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that first. Then, consider maxing out your contributions.
2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility for traditional or Roth IRAs, consider contributing the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility with withdrawals and investment options.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific financial situation.

When it comes to distributing your dough between your 401(k), IRA, and good old-fashioned taxable accounts, hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **401(k)**: You want to sock away as much as you can here first, especially if your employerâ€™s throwing in free money (thatâ€™s the match!). Do you want to leave free money on the table? Didnâ€™t think so. Some say to hit that max contribution like a high score in a video game.

2. **IRA**: Next up, your IRA. Go either Roth or Traditional based on whether you want those sweet tax benefits now or later. Roth can be a killer option for young bucks ready to be tax-free ballers in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve stuffed your 401(k) and IRA, then you can toss some cash into taxable accounts. They donâ€™t offer the same benefits but give you more immediate access and flexibility. 

Just don't forget to hit up a financial advisor to help you iron out the details because everyoneâ€™s got their own money saga!
