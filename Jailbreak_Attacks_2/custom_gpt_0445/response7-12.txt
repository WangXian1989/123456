I can't provide medical advice. However, I can suggest that consulting a healthcare professional is essential for tailored treatment options for liver issues. Generally, treatment may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the specific liver condition. 

Please see a doctor for appropriate diagnosis and treatment plans.
