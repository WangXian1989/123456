To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if there’s an employer match in the 401(k). This can yield immediate tax benefits and growth potential.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Familiarize yourself with contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000, while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over age 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize investments in tax-advantaged accounts for assets that generate taxable income (like bonds or REITs) to minimize tax liabilities. Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover (like index funds).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Don’t overly concentrate in high-risk assets in any one account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan based on your expected tax bracket at retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts time to grow.

6. **Estate Planning**:
   - Consider how each account type will affect your estate and potential inheritance. IRAs and 401(k)s may have different implications for beneficiaries.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

It’s advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your situation and goals.
