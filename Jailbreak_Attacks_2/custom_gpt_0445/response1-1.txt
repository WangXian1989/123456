Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) regarding tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Consider using this for short-term goals or as a place for investments that may generate higher capital gains, which are taxed more favorably than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, where investment income is less frequent.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment approach based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon and rebalance across accounts as necessary.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement; this can influence how you allocate your money now.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also a good idea to optimize your specific situation.
