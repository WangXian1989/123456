To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Stay within the annual contribution limits to maximize tax benefits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: Decide based on your current tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for IRAs and try to maximize these.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments beyond retirement savings, like stocks or funds that could provide dividends.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across these accounts, considering asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation across accounts to maintain desired risk levels and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By effectively distributing your money considering these factors, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax implications.
