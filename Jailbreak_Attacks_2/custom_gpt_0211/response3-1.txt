Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. These accounts can be used for goals before retirement.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (index funds, low-turnover funds).
   - **IRA**: Choose investments based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

Implementing this strategy can help optimize your investments while considering taxes and retirement planning.
