Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility, especially for short- to medium-term goals. This is also useful if you have maxed out contributions in your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Stock/Bond Allocation:** Allocate stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal) and bonds in taxable accounts (to manage interest income taxes).

### 5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of salary up to the match 
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 in 2023)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remaining funds based on short-term needs
