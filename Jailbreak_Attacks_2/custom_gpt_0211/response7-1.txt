To optimize your distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that off before heavily investing.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that first, then consider increasing contributions to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional funds to a taxable account. Consider using this for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.
   - Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investment strategy, rebalancing as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
