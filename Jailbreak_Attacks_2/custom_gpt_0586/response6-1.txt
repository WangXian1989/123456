To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, maximize your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate funds here for flexibility and access, especially for short-term goals.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income now but taxing withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs provide the same tax advantage, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed annually, so consider using these for investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Include a mix of more liquid assets for shorter-term needs but consider long-term investments to minimize annual taxes.

### 4. **Rebalancing Strategy:**
   - Regularly review and adjust asset allocations across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement, considering the tax implications to minimize your tax burden.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
