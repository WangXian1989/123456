Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains, dividends, and interest are taxed in the year they are realized, so consider using these accounts for investments with lower turnover.

3. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties. Use these for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) often have penalties for early withdrawals, so prioritize them for long-term growth.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and return.
   
5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Re-evaluate your distribution strategy periodically (e.g., annually) to ensure it aligns with changing financial goals, tax laws, or personal circumstances.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
