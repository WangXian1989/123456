Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Use 401(k) and traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - Invest in a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Maintain taxable accounts for flexibility and to manage capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.
   - If your current tax rate is low, consider contributing to Roth accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-producing assets (like bonds) to manage taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changes in income, or alterations in your financial goals.

Itâ€™s often advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
