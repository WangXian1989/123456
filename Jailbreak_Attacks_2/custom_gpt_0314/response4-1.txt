To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:
     - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now.
     - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may incur higher taxes (e.g., bonds or actively managed funds) since capital gains in these accounts are taxed differently.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified investment approach across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Strategically plan for withdrawals in retirement from each account type to minimize taxes over time.

6. **Personal Goals**:
   - Align your investment distribution with your short-term and long-term financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can be beneficial, especially regarding complex tax situations.

By following these principles, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your retirement accounts and investments.
