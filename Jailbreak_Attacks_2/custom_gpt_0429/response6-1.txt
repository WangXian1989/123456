Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out this account next, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Only invest in taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts. Taxable accounts can be useful for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. **Balanced Approach to Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors might lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds and conservative investments.
   - **Investment Types**: Favor investments that provide the best tax benefits in the right accounts:
     - **401(k) and IRA**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) here to benefit from tax deferral.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider dividend-paying stocks or municipal bonds, which may have favorable tax treatment.

### Conclusion
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Focus on getting the most out of tax-advantaged accounts before moving funds to taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
