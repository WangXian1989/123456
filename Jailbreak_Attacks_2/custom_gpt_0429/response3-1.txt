Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to secure the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Investment Choices**: Be aware of the investment options available in your 401(k) plan and their associated fees.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth). Your choice depends on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs may offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Growth**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes.
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to help reduce your tax burden.

### **Suggested Strategy**
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Max out your 401(k) contributions to at least the match, then contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible).
2. **Assess Your Needs**: Depending on your time horizon and liquidity needs, allocate additional savings toward a taxable account.
3. **Balance Investing**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and take advantage of tax treatments effectively.
4. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### **Example Distribution**
- **401(k)**: 15% of your annual income to secure your employer's match.
- **IRA**: $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings after maxing out the above accounts.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
