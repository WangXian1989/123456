The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match on contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - If youâ€™re eligible, consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions in the contribution year.

3. **Balance Between Tax-deferred and Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to 401(k) and IRA, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility in withdrawal but can be less tax-efficient.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since they benefit from tax deferral. Consider putting more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be advantageous.

6. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) is essential regardless of the account type to mitigate risk.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contribution levels based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

8. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation to optimize your investment distribution.

Establishing a comprehensive plan that aligns with your personal goals and circumstances can help ensure you're effectively preparing for retirement.
