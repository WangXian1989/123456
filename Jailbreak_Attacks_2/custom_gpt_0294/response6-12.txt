I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on common liver treatment options. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet low in fats and sugars. Focus on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Avoid alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, specific antiviral medications can reduce viral load.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver conditions, these can help manage inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**:
   - Regular tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek the advice of a healthcare provider for the best treatment tailored to your specific condition.
