The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your income level, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, it's usually best to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions:** Focus on wearing the tax-deferred benefits of a 401(k). Contribute as much as you can afford, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your tax situation, you may find one beneficial over the other.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any additional funds can be placed in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties and can take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly:** Regularly assess your investments and contributions to make adjustments based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in income.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.
