When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to balance tax implications, growth potential, and your financial goals. Here are several strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider traditional or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation. Max out contributions if eligible.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) match and IRA contributions, allocate additional funds to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.
   - Use taxable accounts for any extra funds considering the flexibility they offer.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax bracket; typically, withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts are taxed as income, whereas capital gains from taxable accounts might be taxed at a lower rate.
   - Keep tax implications in mind for any early withdrawals.

Always consider your specific financial situation and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
