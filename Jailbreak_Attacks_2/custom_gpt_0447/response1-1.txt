Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) but with income limits for tax deductions if you or your spouse are covered by a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals or when you need access to funds without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. They can help you balance contributions based on your overall financial picture.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so it’s important to regularly review your plans as your financial situation and goals evolve.
