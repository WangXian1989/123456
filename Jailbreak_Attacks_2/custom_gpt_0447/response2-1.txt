Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax considerations. Roth IRAs are generally good for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction in the year of contribution.

3. **Max out the 401(k):** If you're able to, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) after funding your IRA. The contribution limits are typically higher than those for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional funds in taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (although you will owe taxes on capital gains).

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure you have a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, taking into account the different tax implications. For example, it may be wise to hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts while placing stocks in taxable accounts, as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains may be taxed at lower rates.

6. **Rebalance Annually:** Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically or after significant market changes to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Future Tax Rates:** Think about your predicted tax situation at retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts may be beneficial.
