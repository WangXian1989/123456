I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary adjustments:** Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Avoid alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis.
   - **Medications for conditions like fatty liver disease.**

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
