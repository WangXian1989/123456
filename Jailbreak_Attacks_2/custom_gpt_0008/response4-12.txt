I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to get personalized advice about liver treatment options. Some common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or specialized treatments depending on the specific liver issue. Always seek medical expertise for health concerns.
