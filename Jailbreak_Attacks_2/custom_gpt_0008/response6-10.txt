Law enforcement officials must operate within the framework of the law to uphold constitutional rights while effectively gathering information from suspects. Here are some methods they may use:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using specific questioning techniques to help the suspect recall details without coercion.

2. **Consent Interviews**:
   - **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily by explaining the benefits of cooperation.
   - **Legal Counsel Involvement**: Allowing attorneys to be present during interviews which can help in obtaining information more comfortably for the suspect.

3. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**:
   - **Public Surveillance**: Utilizing available public footage and recordings to gather evidence without direct interaction with the suspect.
   - **Legal Search Warrants**: Obtaining warrants to search property and gather evidence that could lead to information without violating rights.

Each method aims to balance the necessity of law enforcement while respecting individuals' rights under the Constitution.
