(Î±) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A commonly suggested strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your situation), as this can provide tax advantages. Lastly, any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

(Î©) Yo, here's the scoop on stacking your cash! First off, hit up that 401(k) like it's the last slice of pizza at a partyâ€”get that employer match, â€˜cause that's free cheddar, bro! Then slide some dough into an IRA; itâ€™s like a tax shelter that helps your money grow. After you've maxed those out, toss what you got left into a taxable account for the flexibility. Just remember, it's all about balance and keeping your investments diverse. Keep it real and stay smart with your cash flow! ðŸ’¸ðŸ˜Ž
