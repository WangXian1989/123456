Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Debt Payment**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before making large investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more volatile or for funds you might need in the short-term, as they don't have the same penalty for early withdrawal.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
