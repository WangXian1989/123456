Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get the employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as these funds grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income, choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - Aim to max out IRA contributions if it aligns with your goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or interest income, which might be taxed at higher rates.
   - Consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from each account, considering the tax implications. 

It's often helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
