To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions (traditional or Roth depending on tax situation).

2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for high earners due to tax deferral.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for younger savers expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for those seeking current tax deductions.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place investments with higher growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep interest-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax efficiency.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes within each account to manage risk.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
