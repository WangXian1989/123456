The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the income requirements.

2. **Diversification and Liquidity**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals and ensure that you have enough liquidity for immediate needs or emergency funds. These accounts can also be useful for tax-loss harvesting strategies.

3. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - **Invest according to risk tolerance**: More aggressive investments might go into your 401(k) or IRA since these are long-term growth accounts, while more stable investments could be in a taxable account.

Ultimately, assess your entire financial picture and adjust allocations based on your unique situation and goals. It may also be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
