To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement Goals**: Determine how much you’ll need for retirement and by when.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Identify how much you might need in the short term.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains instead of regular income (like stocks) to minimize tax impact.
   - Keep cash or high-quality bonds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for stable income-producing investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

By strategically allocating your assets, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
