To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts first. They offer tax advantages that taxable accounts do not.
   - For a **Traditional IRA**, you may receive tax deductions on contributions. A **Roth IRA** allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Hold higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, as they generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) may be beneficial.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have sufficient cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, while keeping long-term investments in retirement accounts.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, tax laws, and changing personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a professional for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy.
