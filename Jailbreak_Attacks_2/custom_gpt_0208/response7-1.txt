Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you expect your tax rate to increase or decrease in the future.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, especially if you have not reached the maximum contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Keep a separate emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid tapping into retirement accounts early.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 20%

This is just a starting point; adjust based on your individual circumstances.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For personalized strategies considering your specific financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor is a great step.
