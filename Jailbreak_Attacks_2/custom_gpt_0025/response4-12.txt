I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Consulting a healthcare professional is crucial for personalized advice.
