Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a match. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Assess Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options and fees in your 401(k). If the options are limited or costly, consider prioritizing your IRA.

4. ** taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments with higher turnover or those that generate taxable income, as you may have more flexibility here.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: As you age, gradually shift towards more conservative investments, but maintain a diversified portfolio to manage risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor an allocation strategy to your specific financial circumstances.

These steps can help optimize your investment strategy and ensure a balanced approach to long-term savings.
