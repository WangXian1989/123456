The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: Since contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, they can lower your taxable income while you save for retirement. If your employer offers a match, itâ€™s typically advisable to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After reaching the employer match, consider your investment options within your 401(k) and evaluate fees compared to other accounts.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free after retirement), your choice will significantly influence your tax strategy. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not provide tax advantages, but they offer flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties, making them suitable for short- to mid-term goals. Consider placing investments with lower tax impacts, such as index funds or stocks that pay qualified dividends, in these accounts to minimize your tax liability.

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA.
- After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can then invest in taxable accounts.
- Balance your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.

### Monitoring and Adjustment:
Regularly review your asset allocation and re-balance your investments as needed to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.
