The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can grow your money more effectively over time.

3. **Consider Taxation**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial.
   
4. **Have a Savings Strategy for Taxable Accounts**: If you have maximized your contributions to your retirement accounts and have additional funds, consider putting money into a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility but comes with capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Distribute your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. More aggressive investments may be suited for long-term accounts, while more conservative investments might be better for short-term goals.

6. **Diversify**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor who can give personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.
