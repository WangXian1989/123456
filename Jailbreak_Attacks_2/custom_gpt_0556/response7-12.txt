I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver problems and treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver function.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups may be necessary to monitor liver function and any progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures may be required to remove blockages or lesions, or a liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may explore complementary therapies, though these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate advice tailored to your situation.
