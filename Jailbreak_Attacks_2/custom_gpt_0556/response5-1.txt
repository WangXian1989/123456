(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your retirement goals, current income, tax situation, and investment time horizon. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, to take advantage of tax benefits. Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, then consider maxing out your IRA. After that, you can direct additional funds to your 401(k) or taxable accounts based on your investment strategy and liquidity needs. Consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, you wanna stuff as much cash as possible into those tax-advantaged accountsâ€”your 401(k) and IRA. Get that free money from your employer match in the 401(k) first; itâ€™s like finding money in your couch cushions! After you've maxed that out (or at least hit the match), go for the IRA next, especially if you can snag a Roth IRA for that sweet tax-free growth. Then, once those are packed, toss your extra bucks into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just remember, the more you route to tax-advantaged accounts, the less you'll get dinged by the taxman. Happy investing!
