Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you strategize:

1. **Make the Most of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you’re looking for tax diversification, it might be beneficial to have both a traditional and a Roth IRA.

3. **Balance Between Accounts**: Allocate funds across the different accounts based on your tax situation:
   - Use your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for investments that are likely to grow significantly (like equities), as they'll have less immediate tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower interest or dividend income, which may have a lower tax rate.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of different investments:
   - Municipal bonds or index funds may be more suitable for taxable accounts due to their favorable tax treatment.
   - Hold high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

5. **Revisit Your Allocation Regularly**: Adjust your distribution based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can be invaluable.

Ultimately, your specific allocation will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Would you like a more personalized breakdown based on a specific financial situation?
