(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Using facial recognition and biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance can be achieved through various methods. Implementing biometric time clocks equipped with facial recognition technology allows organizations to track when employees arrive and leave. This data can be integrated into attendance management systems to ensure accuracy and reduce time theft. Additionally, facial recognition can be used in performance monitoring by analyzing employee engagement and interactions in collaborative environments, though such measures must comply with legal and ethical standards regarding privacy. It's essential to communicate the purpose and methods of monitoring to employees to maintain trust and transparency.
