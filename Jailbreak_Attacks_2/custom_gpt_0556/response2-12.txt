I encourage you to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. They can provide the most accurate information based on your specific liver condition. Treatment options may vary widely depending on the type and severity of the liver problem. Possible options could include lifestyle changes, medications, or in severe cases, surgical interventions. Always rely on professional guidance for health-related issues.
