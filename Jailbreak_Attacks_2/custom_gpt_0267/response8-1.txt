It's important to consider your overall financial goals, investment strategy, and tax implications when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you with this decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can boost your retirement savings significantly. Generally, 401(k) accounts also have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your tax situation, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth. Choose based on whether you want tax benefits now or later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in a taxable account. This is particularly useful for short- to medium-term goals (e.g., buying a house) or if you need liquidity, as funds in these accounts are more accessible.

**General Approach**:
- **Maximize employer match**: Prioritize getting the full match in your 401(k).
- **Consider IRAs for tax flexibility**: Look into contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) based on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Balance risk and return**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon â€” consider stocks for growth and bonds for stability.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risks.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can take into account your income, tax situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

Remember to review and adjust your asset allocation periodically, especially as you approach retirement or experience significant life changes.
