To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for up to the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds or REITs), as these can be more tax-efficient when held in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Consultation and Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and consult with a financial advisor to adapt your strategy based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment approach for both growth and tax efficiency.
