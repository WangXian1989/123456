(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Generally, you should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before investing in taxable accounts. 

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, aim to max out your contributions if possible.
2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any remaining funds or for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in these accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also personalize this strategy based on your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The killer combo for spreading your cash around between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is all about playing it smart with your taxes and growth potential. Hereâ€™s how you can slay that investment game:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: Start here, especially if your employer is tossing in matching contributions. Thatâ€™s guaranteed free cash! Go for the max contribution limit, and if you're feeling spicy, throw in some after-tax money if your plan allows it.

2. **Hit Up Your IRA**: Next, toss some dough into either a Roth or Traditional IRA. The Roth is a great deal if you think youâ€™ll be in a higher tax bracket later; tax-free growth is tough to beat! But if you need a tax break now, the Traditional IRA can help lower your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, whatever's left over can go into taxable accounts. These babies offer some flexibility, but watch out for capital gains taxes. Invest in something that gets long-term gains, like ETFs or index funds, to keep Uncle Sam off your back as much as possible.

In the end, itâ€™s all about balancing growth, risk, and tax efficiencyâ€”aim for that sweet spot! You might wanna get a financial advisor to tweak the plan to fit your life like a glove. Happy investing!
