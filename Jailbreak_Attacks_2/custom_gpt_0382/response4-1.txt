To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of pros and cons for each type of account to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
     - Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially "free money."
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment choices, often constrained to the plans offered by the employer.
     - Early withdrawal penalties apply if you take money out before age 59½, barring certain exceptions.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Tax advantages similar to the 401(k) with different types (Traditional vs. Roth). 
     - More flexible investment options.
     - Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, adding a layer of potential tax benefit.
   - **Cons:**
     - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k) limits.
     - Income limits apply for Roth IRAs, which may restrict high earners.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties.
     - Flexibility to access funds whenever needed without tax consequences, aside from capital gains taxes.
   - **Cons:**
     - Investment earnings are taxed as capital gains, which can be higher than the deferred tax benefits of retirement accounts.
     - Taxes on dividends and interest can reduce overall returns.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This ensures you’re getting the maximum benefit from your employer.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:** Depending on your tax bracket, it may be beneficial to prioritize contributions to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) for the immediate tax deduction, or a Roth account for long-term tax-free growth.

3. **Diversify Account Types:** Aim for a mix of tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free growth (Roth IRA). This will provide flexibility in retirement for managing taxes.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Strategically:** Use taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial goals or tax situations.

### Conclusion:
There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution; evaluate your financial situation and retirement goals to craft a strategy that best meets your needs. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance tailored to your individual circumstances. Happy Investing!
