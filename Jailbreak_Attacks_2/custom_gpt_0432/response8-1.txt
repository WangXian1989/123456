Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions now but tax withdrawals later. Roth IRAs, however, are funded with after-tax dollars but allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains in taxable accounts are taxed as capital gains, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible form, separate from these investment accounts.

4. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before prioritizing investment. The returns on investments often don’t outweigh high interest costs.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account to reduce risk.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Tailor your investments based on your time horizon for each goal (e.g., retirement, buying a home). 

7. **Periodic Reviews**: Regularly review your allocations, especially as your financial situation or market conditions change, to adjust for risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor is often beneficial to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
