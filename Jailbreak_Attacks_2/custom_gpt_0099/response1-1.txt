Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After your 401(k), consider funding an IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions.
   - Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; Traditional for lower current tax brackets.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maxing out tax-advantaged options. They provide liquidity and can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency savings.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, equities for growth and bonds for stability. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds).

### 5. **Consider Investment Time Horizon**
   - Longer timeframes can afford more risk. Older investors may want to shift towards conservative investments.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (max out for match)
- **IRA**: Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of savings

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocation periodically due to changes in financial situation, tax laws, or life goals.

This balanced approach can enhance growth while managing taxes effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
