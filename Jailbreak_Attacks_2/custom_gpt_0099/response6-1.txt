To optimize your distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. This reduces your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, allowing you to manage taxes more effectively.

### 2. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k) for Growth:** Invest in high-growth options within your 401(k) where taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA for Bonds or Fixed Income:** Use your IRA for bonds or fixed income that may generate taxable income, as these will grow tax-deferred.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Withdraw from Taxable First:** During retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.
   - **Strategically Withdraw from IRAs:** Manage withdrawals from IRAs to minimize taxes in retirement, avoiding large tax brackets.

### 4. **Account Types**
   - **Utilize Roth Options:** If available, consider Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA accounts for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep an eye on the performance across all accounts to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your goals.

By carefully balancing your contributions and investments across these accounts, you can maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
