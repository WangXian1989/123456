When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - Max out contributions to these accounts before considering taxable accounts.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce taxable income now; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts for balanced risk.
   - Consider asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50% (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 25%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 25%

### Final Thought:
Consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
