To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Utilize Tax Advantages**:
     - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; ideal for high-income years.
     - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free; choose based on your expected tax situation at withdrawal.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains tax.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Match your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equity-heavy investments should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Specific Investments**: Hold investments with low turnover or tax-favored income (like qualified dividends) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes and stretch the longevity of your funds.
   - Consider first withdrawing from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs). 

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation.
