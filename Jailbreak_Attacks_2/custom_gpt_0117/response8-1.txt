To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) if eligible. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - If you have a high income or can't contribute to a Roth, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Allocate Funds Based on Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)/Traditional IRA**: Good for higher-income years since contributions lower your taxable income. Invest in assets with high expected growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal for tax-free growth; consider holding investments that may appreciate significantly in value.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for more liquid investments and consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts, adjusting for your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may be taxed. It's often beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first in retirement to minimize tax implications.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reevaluate your allocation and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth potential while minimizing tax exposure.
