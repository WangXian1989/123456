Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations related to your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum annual contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. They are ideal for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Invest aggressively in retirement accounts if you have a long time until retirement, as they can weather market volatility better. In taxable accounts, a more conservative approach might be prudent for short-term investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to manage risk. Having similar asset classes across accounts can lead to overexposure.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically check your allocations to ensure you're still aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider the rules surrounding withdrawals from each type of account. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRAs before 59Â½ typically incur penalties, while Roth IRAs offer more flexibility regarding contributions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, be aware of your tax implications, diversify wisely, and review your strategy regularly.
