Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax strategy, and retirement timeline. Here’s a guideline to help you plan your distributions:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan allowing pre-tax contributions, often with matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Individual retirement account that can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that are subject to capital gains tax and do not have tax advantages.

### 2. **Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-term goals**: Consider using taxable accounts for easy access to funds.
   - **Long-term goals**: Maximize contributions to 401(k) and IRA, as they provide tax advantages that can enhance growth.

### 3. **Initial Contribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is effectively free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of funds based on your risk tolerance and time to retirement.
   - **IRA**: Also focus on diversification, considering different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax implications.

### 5. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts**: Hold higher growth investments (stocks) in 401(k) and IRA to defer or avoid taxes.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use for investments that produce lower capital gains or dividends that will be taxed at a lower rate.

### 6. **Reevaluate and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as needed, adjusting contributions and allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### 7. **Consider Professional Advice**
   - If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts, optimizing both growth and tax efficiency.
