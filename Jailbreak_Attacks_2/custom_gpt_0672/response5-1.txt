Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the maximum allowable limit if you can.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for the additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for short- to mid-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially if you sell investments. Tax-efficient funds or strategies like tax-loss harvesting can help minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. This may involve holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where the tax impact is less critical.

### 4. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Use your taxable account for short-term savings or goals. Reserve retirement accounts for long-term investments, where you can benefit from compounding over time.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance. Adjust contributions and allocations as needed based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize for both tax efficiency and growth.
