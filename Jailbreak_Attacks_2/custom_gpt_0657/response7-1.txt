The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. Then, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. 

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are often tax-deferred, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth. Taxable accounts do not have these tax advantages but provide more flexibility for withdrawals. Prioritize contributions where you can gain the most tax advantages.

3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Allocate some of your savings to a taxable account if you need access to funds in the short term, while keeping an emergency fund in a separate savings account for unforeseen expenses.

4. **Long-Term Growth**: For long-term growth, funds in tax-advantaged accounts typically provide better compounding benefits. Once those accounts are maximized, surplus funds can be directed into taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider a diversified investment strategy for each account based on your risk tolerance. Stocks may be better suited for long-term accounts, while bonds might be appropriate for taxable accounts where income is taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your accounts regularly to ensure that the distribution aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

It may also be beneficial to consult a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
