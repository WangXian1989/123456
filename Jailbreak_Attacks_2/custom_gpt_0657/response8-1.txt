The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and can greatly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. If you have a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: 
   - Consider having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This can provide flexibility in managing your tax burden in retirement.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you are saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA). 
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), you may want to focus on your taxable accounts as they'll provide easier access to funds without penalties.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and try to maximize contributions within those limits to enhance your retirement savings.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and investment performance, and adjust your strategy as needed based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

Before making any decisions, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
