The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can be directed toward taxable accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) generally provide better long-term growth potential due to tax benefits.

4. **Consider Financial Goals and Time Horizon**: If you're saving for short-term goals (like a house), prioritize taxable accounts since they provide more flexibility. For long-term retirement savings, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you hold different types of investments. For example, investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks—especially those with potential for long-term capital gains—can be kept in taxable accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Income Needs**: As you approach retirement, you may want to shift more funds into taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access to funds.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts and adjust based on market performance, changes in income, or life events.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy that fits your unique circumstances and financial goals.
