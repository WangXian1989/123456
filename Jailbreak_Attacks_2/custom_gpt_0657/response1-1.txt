When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Focus on maxing out your contributions (the limit varies annually, so check the latest contribution limits).
   - Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - A Traditional IRA could be ideal if you want to reduce your taxable income now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These can be used for short-term goals or as an emergency fund because they provide flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with the 401(k) to get the match, then contribute to an IRA for the tax advantages, and finally allocate funds to your taxable account.
- **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio suited to your risk profile.
- **Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance that fits your specific circumstances. Would you like to know more about any particular aspect?
