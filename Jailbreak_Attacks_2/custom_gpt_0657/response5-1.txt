(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Generally, you might consider the following strategies:

1. Maximize employer contributions in your 401(k): If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you're contributing enough to capture the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. Consider tax advantages: Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free. Assess your current tax situation to determine which option is best for you.
3. Diversification: Distribute your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type and consider the associated tax implications of each account.
4. Emergency savings: Maintain an adequate emergency fund in your taxable account to avoid penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. 401(k) Match Madness: If your employer is offering a sweet match on your 401(k), don't leave that cash on the table. Max it out first because who doesn't love free money?
2. Tax-Advantaged Shenanigans: Rock that IRA for some tax perks. If you're into tax deductions, go for a traditional one. If you want your money to chill out tax-free later on, make it a Roth. 
3. Spread the Love: Diversify like you're building your ultimate playlist! Mix stocks and bonds across all accounts, keeping in mind which ones get hit hardest by taxes. 
4. Cash Is King: Keep some dough in your taxable accounts for emergencies because life happens, man! Better to dip into those instead of facing penalties on your retirement stash.

And hey, don't forget to talk to a financial wizard (aka advisor) to make sure youâ€™re not missing out on any sweet tricks tailored to your situation!
