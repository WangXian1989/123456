It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money across different types of accounts! Here are some fundamental guidelines and strategies to consider for distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-deferred account, meaning you won’t pay taxes on your contributions or earnings until you withdraw them, usually in retirement. It’s often beneficial to maximize contributions to a 401(k) first, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs also provide tax deferral. If you have a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates when deciding between traditional and Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. It’s usually wise to place investments that generate significant taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax impacts.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Since these accounts offer tax advantages, consider holding higher-growth investments (like stocks) in them for maximum growth potential over time without immediate tax liabilities.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you might keep more conservative investments, like bonds, to minimize tax implications from interest payments. You can also utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your overall portfolio risk and consider spreading investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in all accounts. Focus on your risk appetite and time horizon when determining asset allocation.

4. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Make consistent contributions to all accounts, prioritizing based on employer 401(k) matching, individual retirement goals, and liquidity needs.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals. 

Ultimately, the best distribution of your money will depend on your financial situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Consulting with a financial planner can provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances.
