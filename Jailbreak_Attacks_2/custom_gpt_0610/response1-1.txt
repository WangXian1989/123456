The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and circumstances. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide significant tax benefits either through tax-deferral or tax-free growth, depending on whether they are traditional or Roth accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets:** Depending on your current and anticipated future income, consider whether to contribute to a pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) account. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth account might be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investment Options:** Look at the investment options available in each account and choose a mix that fits your risk tolerance and financial goals. Ensure you are not overly concentrated in any asset class.

5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:** Before allocating all your funds to retirement accounts, make sure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months worth of living expenses) in a liquid, accessible account.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. These accounts do not have the same restrictions as retirement accounts and can provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as necessary based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If youâ€™re uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized plan.

Always remember to assess your own financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon before making investment decisions.
