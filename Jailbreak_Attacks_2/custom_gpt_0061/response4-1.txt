Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - After maximizing the match, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Invest any additional savings in a taxable account. This is useful for flexibility and for funds you might need before retirement.

5. **Risk Assessment**: 
   - Ensure your asset allocation matches your risk tolerance across all accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals and market conditions.
