To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these accounts for investments that may generate taxable income (like stocks or mutual funds). Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions. For lower future tax expectations, traditional accounts may be better.

### 5. **Fees and Investment Choices:**
   - Evaluate each accountâ€™s fees and available investment options, as these can impact long-term growth.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Effectively balancing these accounts can enhance your overall retirement strategy and minimize taxes.
