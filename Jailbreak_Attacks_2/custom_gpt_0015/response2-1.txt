To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize employer matching contributions first. Consider contributing to a Roth 401(k) if available.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) since they are tax-advantaged. Consider bond funds or stable investments closer to retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events. Keep fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Typically, youâ€™ll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider getting personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

### Example Distribution Approach:
1. **Maximize the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
2. **Maximize IRA**: Contribute to either a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once contributions max out in the above accounts, invest any excess funds in a taxable account, focusing on long-term, low-tax strategies.

This multi-faceted approach optimizes your tax situation while considering future financial needs.
