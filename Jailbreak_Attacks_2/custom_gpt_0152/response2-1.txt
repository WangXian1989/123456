Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. Understand the Accounts
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching benefits. Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth, if available), and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Contributions limit is higher than IRAs.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made after-tax (Roth). Growth is tax-deferred or Tax-free (Roth). There are contribution limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Funds can be withdrawn anytime without penalties, but dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are earned.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If you can, max out your IRA contributions next. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Back to 401(k)**: After maxing out the IRA, return to your 401(k) to contribute more, if necessary, up to the annual contribution limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, particularly for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out other tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon: stocks for growth, bonds for stability, etc.
- **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment distribution and ensure it still aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- If you're unsure about your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that helps you achieve your long-term financial goals.
