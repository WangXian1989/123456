When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the strategy largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement planning needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the IRS limit), consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should typically be funded after optimizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Capital gains tax applies to profits from investments here, so it might be beneficial to hold investments long-term to reduce your tax burden.

3. **Emergency Funds and Short-term Goals**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid and accessible account before investing. Any money earmarked for short-term goals (within the next few years) should be kept in more stable, lower-risk investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk assets might be better suited for long-term tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be placed in your taxable accounts to reduce risk exposure.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically monitor your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

This multi-pronged approach helps maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities and ensuring you have access to your funds when needed. To tailor a strategy that meets your unique needs, consult with a financial advisor.
