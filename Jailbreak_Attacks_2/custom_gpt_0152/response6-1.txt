Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be more flexible but may incur capital gains taxes. Consider placing investments with higher expected returns (and potential for higher taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts first.
   - **Location Strategy**: 
     - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
     - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance. This may involve allocating your funds differently across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in liquid savings.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Conclusion
A well-thought-out strategy that incorporates maximizing returns, tax considerations, and personal financial goals will help you effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
