I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver problems and their treatment options. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help support liver health. Avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods is also recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve overall liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These may be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but it's essential to discuss this with your doctor, as some herbs can affect liver function.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular liver function tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health and detect any changes early.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always work closely with your healthcare provider to determine the best treatment based on your specific condition and health status.
