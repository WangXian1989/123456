Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) since it offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are more flexible and can be accessed without penalties, but they don’t have the same tax advantages.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you can hold riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes in retirement. Typically, you start taking from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Review your distribution strategy regularly to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and tax laws.
