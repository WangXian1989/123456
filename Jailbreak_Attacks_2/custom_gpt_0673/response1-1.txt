Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you have a company match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable investment account. This allows for more flexibility without withdrawal restrictions.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure diversification among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Familiarize yourself with the tax implications of each account type. For instance, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed more favorably than short-term gains.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Balance is key, and adapting your strategy as your financial situation evolves is crucial.
