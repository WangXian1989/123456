Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Start with Employer Matching:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the maximum match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After securing the match from your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can lower your taxable income, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs ($22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs in 2023, plus catch-up contributions for those over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - **Taxable Investment Accounts:** If you have room after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, start contributing to a taxable investment account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investments but is subject to capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Stocks generally have higher growth potential, while bonds may offer stability.
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Bonds or dividend-paying investments may be more suitable for taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring:**
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations and adjust as necessary based on market performance and your financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider professional advice for tailored strategies, especially if you're uncertain about specific investment choices or tax implications.

### Example Allocation:
Assuming you have $1,000 to invest:
- **401(k):** $400 (max up to match)
- **IRA:** $300 (Traditional or Roth based on your situation)
- **Taxable Account:** $300 (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Final Thoughts:
Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.
