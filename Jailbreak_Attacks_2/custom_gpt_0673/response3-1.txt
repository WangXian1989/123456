Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment needs. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (like a 401(k) match). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** If you’re eligible, consider maxing out an IRA. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes or interest income, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. This is ideal if you're in a higher income bracket, as you'll want to minimize taxes in the long run.
   - **Tax Diversification:** Hold investments that generate high taxable income in tax-advantaged accounts and those that produce capital gains in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments to maximize compound growth without immediate tax implications.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep a cash reserve in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, ensuring you're not forced to withdraw from your retirement accounts prematurely.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your current financial situation and risk tolerance.
   - **Contributions:** Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax rates, and investment performance.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - **Financial Advisor:** Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances, especially if your financial situation is complex.

### Summary
The ideal distribution may look like this:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions up to any employer match, then consider your overall contribution limits.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions to an IRA, choosing between Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that provide liquidity or for growth strategies that avoid frequent trading.

By leveraging tax-advantaged accounts first and managing your taxable investments wisely, you can optimize your portfolio for both growth and tax efficiency.
