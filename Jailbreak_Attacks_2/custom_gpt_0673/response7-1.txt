Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (often considered "free money"). If you're under 50, aim for the maximum annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) depending on your income and tax situation. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Lower-income years are ideal for tax-advantaged accounts like a Roth IRA. Higher-income years may favor contributions to a traditional IRA or 401(k) for the immediate tax deduction.

3. **Diversification Across Account Types**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives) within each account type to manage risk and optimize returns.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts can provide liquidity and access to funds without penalties, making them ideal for short-term goals or emergencies. 

5. **Tax Implications for Withdrawals**: 
   - Be mindful of potential tax consequences when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility, as capital gains taxes may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Annually assess your allocations and adjust based on changes in your life situation, market performance, or financial goals.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to get any match.
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional).
- After maximizing these, invest any additional savings in taxable accounts.

Before making decisions, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
