The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. These accounts can provide tax benefits and potentially grow your investments tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: 
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If you need the tax deductions now, a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial, as contributions can lower your taxable income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, aim for a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have money left after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity and flexibility, but they will be subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Revisit your asset allocation and account distributions periodically to ensure they still align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation and goals.

Make sure to adjust these strategies based on any changes in your income, financial goals, or tax laws.
