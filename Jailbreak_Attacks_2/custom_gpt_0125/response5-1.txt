(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, itâ€™s advised to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your IRA, which offers tax advantages. Lastly, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments, especially if you want access to funds before retirement age. It's also important to consider your current and expected future tax bracket when making these decisions.
