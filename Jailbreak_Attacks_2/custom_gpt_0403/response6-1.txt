To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to reach the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits depending on your income level.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are usually taxed at lower rates. Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize annual tax liability.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a well-balanced portfolio across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Different accounts can host various asset classesâ€”equities in taxable accounts, fixed income in tax-advantaged accounts, etc.

4. **Periodic Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired level of risk and return. This might require selling assets in over-performing accounts and buying in under-performing ones.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term financial growth and tax efficiency.
