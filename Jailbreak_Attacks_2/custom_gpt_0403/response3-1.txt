The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your assets effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible or grow tax-free, respectively. Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates to choose the best option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are generally more flexible and can provide tax-efficient growth, but they don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Goals**: 
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA is more beneficial.
   - For short-term savings, consider using taxable accounts, as they offer more liquidity.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance. Younger investors can often take on more risk, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on more conservative investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that within each account type, you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help craft a strategy tailored to your unique situation.

In summary, aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, take advantage of employer matches, and then use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs.
