When determining how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the best practices:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute at least enough to receive the maximum match.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous because qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can start investing in taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and offers opportunities for long-term capital gains.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and timeline. Tax-advantaged accounts are generally best for longer-term growth investments (stocks), while taxable accounts may be suitable for bonds or more conservative investments due to capital gains tax considerations.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. For instance, place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher tax rates on income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust your contributions to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.
