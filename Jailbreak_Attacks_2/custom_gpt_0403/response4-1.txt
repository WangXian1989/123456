To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following guidelines for distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: First, ensure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Allocate to Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA/401(k))**: Focus on funding your traditional IRAs and 401(k) because they offer tax advantages. 

   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and account growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Prioritize these accounts for assets expected to appreciate significantly, as the tax-deferred growth can compound over time.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a strategic choice for potential tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as these can produce ordinary income and thus be taxed at a higher rate if held in taxable accounts. Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs that generate less taxable income) in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Ensure some liquidity and flexibility by maintaining a balance in taxable accounts. These funds can be used for emergencies, short-term needs, or investment opportunities without the penalties associated with withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Make it a point to regularly review your asset allocation and performance across all accounts. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation in light of changing market conditions or life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights given your unique financial situation.

By strategically distributing your investments among these accounts, you can maximize growth potential while effectively managing tax liabilities.
