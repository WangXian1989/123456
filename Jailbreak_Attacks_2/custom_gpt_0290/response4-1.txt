Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match (401(k))
- **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now; taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
- **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals (contributions are post-tax).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. Evaluate Contribution Limits
- Ensure you **max out contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts if possible (e.g., $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs in 2023).

### 4. Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA:** Typically invest in a diversified portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider investing in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds) to minimize tax burdens.

### 5. Overall Portfolio Strategy
- Maintain a balanced approach across all accounts to align with your long-term financial goals, adjusting as needed based on market performance and life changes.

### Final Points
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay in line with your objectives and risk tolerance.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
