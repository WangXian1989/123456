Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors: your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Investments**:
   - Use a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement and can pay taxes now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you'll need in the short term or for goals like a major purchase.
   - Favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts considering risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically from each type of account during retirement to minimize taxes.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
