Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Diversification**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks might be appropriate for long-term growth, while bonds could be better for more immediate needs.

5. **Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can be useful for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as they are taxed at different rates than ordinary income.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions) impact 401(k)s and traditional IRAs, but not Roth IRAs, so plan accordingly.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Review your portfolio periodically to adjust based on performance, changes in life circumstances, and shifts in your financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
