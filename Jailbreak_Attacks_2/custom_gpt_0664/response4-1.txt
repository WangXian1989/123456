Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund:** Before heavily funding retirement accounts, ensure you have minimal high-interest debt and an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments that are tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) and keep higher-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in retirement accounts to defer taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help optimize your distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation.

Tailoring these strategies to your circumstances will provide a balanced approach to investing across these accounts.
