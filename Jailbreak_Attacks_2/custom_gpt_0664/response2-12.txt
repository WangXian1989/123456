I'm not a doctor, but if you're having liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can be beneficial.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), certain medications might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and overall health.

4. **Specialized Therapies**: For conditions like cirrhosis or liver cancer, treatments may include more specialized interventions such as surgery, radiation, or transplant.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people explore natural supplements, but it's important to discuss these with your doctor to avoid complications.

Make sure to speak with a healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific condition.
