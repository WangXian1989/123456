Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**
   - **Traditional 401(k) or IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, offering tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - Once you max out the employer match, consider contributing to both a Roth and a traditional account if eligible. This can provide tax diversification for retirement.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement. Consider using these for shorter-term goals or when you've maxed out retirement contributions.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance. Consider tax implications:
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) are better suited for taxable accounts.
     - **Bonds and high-yield investments** could be placed in tax-deferred accounts for better tax efficiency.

### 6. **Regular Reassessments**
   - Review your allocations regularly to adapt to changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.

### Summary
Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then assess tax-deferred and taxable accounts based on your unique financial situation. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
