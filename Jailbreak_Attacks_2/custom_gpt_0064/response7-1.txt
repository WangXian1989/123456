It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different types of accounts for investing! Here's a general approach you can consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Your Investment Options**: Look for low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: A traditional IRA allows you to deduct contributions, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax contributions, but your withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions if Possible**: Both types of IRAs have contribution limits—aim to max them out if you can afford it.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Additional Savings**: If you've maximized your retirement accounts and still have money to invest, taxable accounts are a good option.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds such as ETFs or index funds that generate less taxable income.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus first on maxing out your 401(k) and IRAs.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts.
- **Regularly Rebalance Portfolio**: Make sure to review and adjust your investment mix based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Your Age**: Younger investors might prefer more aggressive, growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may focus on preservation.
- **Your Financial Goals**: What are you saving for? Retirement, a house, etc.?
- **Market Conditions**: Keep an eye on economic conditions that might affect your investment strategy.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy based on your individual circumstances and long-term goals. Happy investing!
