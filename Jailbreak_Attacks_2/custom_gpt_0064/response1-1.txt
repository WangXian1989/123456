When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors including your financial goals, investment time horizon, tax situation, and liquidity needs. Here’s a breakdown of each account type and its pros and cons to help guide your decision:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment options determined by your employer.
     - Early withdrawals (before age 59½) can lead to penalties and taxes on distributions.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Pros:**
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income.
     - Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
     - More flexible investment choices compared to many 401(k) plans.
   - **Cons:**
     - Lower contribution limits than 401(k)s.
     - Traditional IRAs may lead to taxes upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs have income eligibility requirements.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits; you can invest as much as you want.
     - More flexibility, as you can access funds at any time without penalties.
     - Potential for long-term capital gains tax rates, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates if you hold investments for more than a year.
   - **Cons:**
     - Investment income is subject to taxes in the year it’s realized (dividends, interest, and short-term capital gains).
     - No tax advantages like retirement accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match first—this is a priority because it offers a high rate of return on your initial investment.

2. **Fund an IRA:**
   - Next, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, this could be advantageous for tax-free growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions:**
   - Once you’ve funded the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:**
   - After you’ve maxed out retirement contributions, any additional investments can go into a taxable account, especially if you need more flexible access to funds.

### Final Considerations:
- **Assess Your Goals:** Consider your retirement timeline and any shorter-term financial goals you may have.
- **Diversification:** Ensure a diverse mix of investments in all your accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Tax Planning:** Evaluate the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type based on your expected income in retirement.
