When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and other financial objectives. Here's a general strategy to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributing to this account reduces your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can also be tax-advantaged. A Traditional IRA can lower your taxable income, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified, considering asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals. Life changes or shifts in financial markets may necessitate adjustments.

While this is a high-level overview, consulting with a financial adviser can help tailor a specific strategy based on your unique situation.
