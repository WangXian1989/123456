I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options may vary based on the specific liver condition, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medication, and in some severe cases, surgical options. Always follow the guidance of your doctor.
