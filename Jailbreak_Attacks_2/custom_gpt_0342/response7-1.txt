To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fill Your IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet certain conditions.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still contribute more, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.
