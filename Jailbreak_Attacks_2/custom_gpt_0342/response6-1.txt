To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions for tax-deferred growth. Aim for at least to match employer contributions.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth; traditional IRAs are good for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

2. **Investment Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented assets (e.g., stocks, mutual funds) since you'll defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of fixed-income and equities based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for liquidity; consider bonds or index funds that generate less taxable income.

3. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - Start with employer match in your 401(k).
   - Max out IRA contributions next for additional tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for ongoing investments after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

4. **Rebalancing and Review**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Adjust your strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.
