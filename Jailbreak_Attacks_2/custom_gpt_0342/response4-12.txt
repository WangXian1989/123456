I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or viral hepatitis is crucial for liver health.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
