I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to talk to a healthcare professional about the best treatment for your situation. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific problem, like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Generally, doctors might suggest lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. In some cases, medications or procedures might be necessary. Always best to get personalized advice from a qualified professional!
