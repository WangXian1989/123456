When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you have a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that you can manage for tax efficiency. Long-term holdings typically incur lower tax rates.

3. **Balance Risk and Growth**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Stocks may grow faster in the long term, while bonds can offer stability.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan to withdraw from taxable accounts first to manage tax levels, then from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA), and lastly from tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Adjust your allocation over time based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your individual circumstances.
