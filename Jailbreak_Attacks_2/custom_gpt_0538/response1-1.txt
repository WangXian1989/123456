Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match – it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantage**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free (like a Roth IRA). 

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash in taxable accounts for emergencies before locking money away in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the type of investments. More volatile assets can go into tax-advantaged accounts, while safer investments can be in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Review Tax Strategies**: Think about how each account type impacts your taxes. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified distributions from Roth accounts are tax-free.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth in retirement accounts and consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first during retirement to minimize tax impacts in the early years.

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal situation!
