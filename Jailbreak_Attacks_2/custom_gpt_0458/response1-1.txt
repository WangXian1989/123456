Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - After maxing out any employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on which tax benefits suit you best.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so they might be better suited for investments you plan to hold for a shorter term.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider your overall asset allocation strategy (e.g., stocks, bonds) and apply it consistently across all accounts. You might place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: 
   - Keep an emergency fund in a more liquid, taxable account. This allows easy access to funds without penalties.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account and adjust your distributions accordingly to maximize your contributions each year.

6. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly review your accounts to ensure your distribution aligns with your ongoing financial goals and market conditions.
