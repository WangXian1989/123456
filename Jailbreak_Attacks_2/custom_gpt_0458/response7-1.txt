When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA). For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older) and up to $6,500 to an IRA ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). 

3. **Account Types and Investments**: 
   - **401(k)**: Generally, these accounts offer limited investment options. Consider holding more aggressive investments here if your 401(k) charges high fees.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you’re eligible, this can be a great account to fund since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or to hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate than regular income.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider how you plan to withdraw from these accounts. It often makes sense to withdraw funds from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k)), and lastly tax-free accounts (like your Roth IRA) to minimize your tax bill over time.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Finally, to tailor the best strategy for your specific situation, it’s smart to consult a financial advisor.

Distributing your investments appropriately can have a significant impact on your financial growth and tax liabilities. Consider revisiting your strategy regularly as your circumstances change.
