The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Maximize contributions if you can, especially if your 401(k) offers low-cost investment options.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Consider maximizing your contributions to either a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate minimal taxable income or capital gains. This might include index funds or investments with a tax-efficient strategy.

4. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, it may be beneficial to pay this off before prioritizing investing.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts in retirement.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
