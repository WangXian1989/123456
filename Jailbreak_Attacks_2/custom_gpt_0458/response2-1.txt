Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. If you have a high-income, explore the possibility of a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for money you may need to access before retirement, as they don't have early withdrawal penalties. Investments in these accounts can be subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding lower-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments in each account type. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and objectives. 

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider working with a financial planner.

This approach should help you efficiently distribute your assets over time while considering both short-term and long-term financial goals.
