Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth, after-tax). Employer matches may be available. Best for long-term growth.
- **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (Traditional IRA for pre-tax contributions, Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but more flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Capital gains taxes apply.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money."
   
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, prioritize maxing out your IRA. The tax benefits can be significant, especially with a Roth IRA if you're eligible.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: If you have room left in your budget, return to your 401(k) to contribute up to the limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for taxable accounts to enhance liquidity and growth opportunities.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**

- Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first to minimize current taxable income.
- Invest in taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement.
- Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Adjust Allocation by Age and Goals**

- **Younger Investors**: May favor more aggressive investments (stocks) in retirement accounts, with more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
- **Near Retirement**: Shift towards more stable investments to preserve capital.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly**

- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on investment performance, changing life circumstances, and shifts in financial goals.

### Conclusion

Start by maximizing free benefits from your 401(k) and then focus on IRA contributions before leveraging taxable accounts. Always consider your tax situation and investment timeline when making allocations. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
