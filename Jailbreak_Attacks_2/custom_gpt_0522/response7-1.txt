Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with potential employer matching. Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Individual accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but lack tax benefits.

### 2. Consider the Following Factors
- **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, high-yield investments (dividend stocks, REITs) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to defer taxes. Investments with lower tax implications, like index funds, can go into taxable accounts.
- **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out contributions to take advantage of compound growth.
- **Withdrawal Needs**: If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, consider keeping some liquidity in taxable accounts.

### 3. Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer matching, then maximize if you're in a high tax bracket or need to reduce taxable income.
2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawal benefits. As a rule of thumb, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, fund a taxable account for additional investments and flexibility.

### 4. Regular Reassessment
- Periodically review your investments and adjust based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax situations.

This general framework should help you devise a strategy tailored to your financial circumstances and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
