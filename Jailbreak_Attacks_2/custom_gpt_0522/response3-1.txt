Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding the tax implications, contribution limits, and your financial goals. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts**

- **401(k)**: 
  - Tax-deferred until withdrawal.
  - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
  - Employer match can be a significant benefit.

- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred; taxes apply on withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
  - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).

- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - No tax advantages; subject to capital gains tax.
  - Offers flexibility for withdrawals at any time.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals**

- **Short-Term Needs**: If you need access to funds in the near future, prioritize taxable accounts.
- **Retirement Savings**: Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and tax advantages.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**

- **401(k)**:
  - Try to contribute enough to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
  - Consider maxing out contributions if you are in a high tax bracket.

- **IRA**:
  - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
  - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be better.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategies**

- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across accounts are well-diversified.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investment strategy based on your age, risk tolerance, and timeline.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly**

- Review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

- If uncertain, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

### Example Allocation Strategy

1. **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to match your employer's contribution.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions (if eligible for Roth).
3. **Taxable**: Use any remaining funds for taxable investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

This strategy ensures you are leveraging tax advantages while preparing for both short and long-term financial needs.
