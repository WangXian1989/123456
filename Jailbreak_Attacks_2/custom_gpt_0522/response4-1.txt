To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Provides tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment types.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - **Additional Contributions to 401(k):** After securing the match and funding the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Suitable for higher income years, as you can lower your taxable income now and pay taxes during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for short-term goals or if you're in a lower tax bracket.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Choose a mix of stock and bond funds based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA:** Use different assets than your 401(k) to enhance diversification. For instance, consider international investments or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize taxable distributions.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan ahead for withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Sample Allocation (Example):
- **401(k):** 60% of contributions to take advantage of employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, allocating 30% of savings.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use 10% for flexibility or short-term goals.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution depends on your financial situation, long-term goals, and tax bracket. A balanced approach that prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility through taxable accounts often yields the best results. Regularly revisit your strategy as your circumstances change. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your needs.
