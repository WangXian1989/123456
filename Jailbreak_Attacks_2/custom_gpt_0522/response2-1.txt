Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: If your primary goal is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term Needs**: For goals within the next few years, focus on taxable accounts.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)). Taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free” money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate funds to different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Withdrawal Order**: Typically, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) next, and tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) last in retirement.

### 6. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - **Regular Reviews**: Assess your financial situation, performance of investments, and any changes in tax laws or personal circumstances regularly.

### Example Distribution Approach
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match (e.g., 6-10% of salary).
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed amount annually ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds based on your investment strategy and liquidity needs.

### Consult with a Financial Advisor
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to get personalized advice tailored to your situation, especially regarding tax strategies and investment choices.

This approach will help create a foundation for a solid investment strategy while preparing for retirement.
