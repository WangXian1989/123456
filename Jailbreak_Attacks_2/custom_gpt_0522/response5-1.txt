Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
- **Benefits:** Tax-deferred growth, potential employer matching.
- **Strategy:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as it’s essentially "free" money. Max out contributions if you can, especially in the higher-income years.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Benefits of Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth. 
- **Benefits of Roth IRA:** Tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Strategy:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions. If you need the immediate tax deduction, consider the traditional IRA. Both types can be maxed out annually.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Benefits:** Flexibility for withdrawals, no contribution limits.
- **Strategy:** Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Keep emergency funds or short-term savings in a high-yield savings account or money market fund.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
1. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before aggressively investing.
2. **Debt Repayment:** Pay off high-interest debt before investing significantly in retirement accounts.
3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs to take advantage of tax benefits.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Supplemental Investing:** Use these accounts for savings beyond retirement, flexible investments, or short-term goals.

### **Final Thoughts**
Balance these strategies based on your personal circumstances, future planning, and risks you're willing to take. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
