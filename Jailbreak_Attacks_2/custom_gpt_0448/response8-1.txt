The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investment Locations**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically invest in a mix of stock funds and bond funds. This can be beneficial for long-term growth, especially if you're younger.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for a mix of investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider putting higher-growth investments in a Roth IRA to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds. Consider using them for savings goals that are sooner than retirement.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Investments that produce high taxable income (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA), while investments with favorable tax treatments (like long-term capital gains from stocks) can be placed in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is many years away, you might want to allocate more to equities for growth. If you're closer to retirement, consider more stable investments.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
