When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, the best approach often depends on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and the specific investment options available in each account. Here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), you should aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to grow your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, prioritize contributing to tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and traditional IRA. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-free until you withdraw them during retirement, which can significantly enhance your compound growth.

3. **Consider Roth Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or prefer tax-free withdrawals, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify. Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but your money grows tax-free.

4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing liquidity before retirement. Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in these accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of where you allocate your funds, ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). This helps manage risk and provides a better chance of achieving desired returns.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so itâ€™s wise to regularly review your allocations and adjust your contributions as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored plan that optimizes your investment strategy.

Overall, the key is to balance your immediate needs and long-term growth while considering your tax situation.
