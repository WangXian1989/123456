Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth, if available), and earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with options for traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) contributions. Limits on contributions based on income and tax filing status.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not have contribution limits or tax advantages. Taxes are paid on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. The 2023 limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - **Fill 401(k) Maximally**: After reaching any IRA limits, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, $30,000 if over 50).

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks, as these accounts provide tax advantages on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use a mix of growth and income-generating investments, while being mindful of tax efficiency (e.g., favoring lower-turnover strategies and tax-efficient funds).

### 4. **Review Your Investments Regularly**
   - Rebalance your portfolios in response to market changes, personal circumstances, or changes in financial goals.
   - Adjust allocations based on changes in risk tolerance as you approach retirement.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use 401(k) and IRAs for tax-deferred growth; withdrawal taxes may apply in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Great for young investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be strategic about selling assets to manage capital gains taxes, especially in higher income years.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help you optimize your tax situation, investment choices, and contributions based on your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a careful analysis of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Prioritize contributions to maximize tax advantages while considering asset allocation strategies to best grow your investments over time.
