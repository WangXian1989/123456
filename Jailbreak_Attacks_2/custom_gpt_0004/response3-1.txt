To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA** (Traditional/Roth): Individual retirement accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. They offer flexibility, but income from these accounts can be taxed annually.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Choose a Roth IRA if you expect your income to increase and prefer tax-free withdrawals later.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

6. **Regular Reviews and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Long-term Goal Focus**:
   - Prioritize retirement savings but also maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
