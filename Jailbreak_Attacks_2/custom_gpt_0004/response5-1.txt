To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA (Roth or Traditional). This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

3. **Diversify Asset Allocation:** Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Consider more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

6. **Rebalance Annually:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.
