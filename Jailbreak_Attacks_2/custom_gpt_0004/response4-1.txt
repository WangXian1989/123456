To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Distribute investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold interest-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - Use taxable accounts for capital gain-friendly investments (like stocks held long-term).

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement based on tax implications to optimize your tax bracket.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation.

This approach will help maximize growth while considering tax implications.
