Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) typically hold more tax-efficient investments, such as stocks, since you won’t pay taxes on the growth until withdrawal (for Traditional) or won't pay taxes at all (for Roth).
   - **Taxable accounts** are suitable for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Distribute your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), ensuring that your portfolio reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goal**: 
   - Younger investors may focus more on growth through equities.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By taking these steps, you can create a more effective distribution strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
