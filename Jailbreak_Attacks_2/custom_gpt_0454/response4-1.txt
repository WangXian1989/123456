To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages here, but flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). IRAs limit contributions to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Longer-term investments generally benefit from tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts for their accessibility without penalties.

5. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), itâ€™s generally wise to contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Maximize the 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).
3. **Return to the 401(k)**: After funding the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the full employer match.
- Max out IRA contribution.
- Continue with 401(k) contributions.
- Invest in taxable accounts based on your remaining funds and financial goals.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances, especially as laws and financial situations can change.
