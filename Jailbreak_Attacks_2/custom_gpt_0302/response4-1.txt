To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-deferred or taxable accounts to better manage taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes in each account. This can help reduce risk and improve returns.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility without penalties, while 401(k)s and IRAs will have tax implications.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep some cash or easily liquidated assets in taxable accounts for emergencies, while still contributing regularly to retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation and goals.
