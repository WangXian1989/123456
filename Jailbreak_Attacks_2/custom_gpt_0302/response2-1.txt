To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: A Traditional IRA gives you a tax break when you contribute, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but these accounts offer flexibility.

3. **Prioritize Roth Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider prioritizing Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you'll create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.
