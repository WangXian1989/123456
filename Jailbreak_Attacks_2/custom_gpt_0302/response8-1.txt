Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: These accounts provide tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they donâ€™t offer tax advantages, they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments can be managed for capital gains and losses.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and optimize returns.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are far from retirement, aggressive growth in your 401(k) and IRA may be appropriate. As you age, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your investment strategy and market conditions.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep enough liquidity in your taxable accounts to cover emergency expenses, rather than relying solely on tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help refine your strategy based on your unique circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

Always remember to review your financial situation periodically and adjust as needed.
