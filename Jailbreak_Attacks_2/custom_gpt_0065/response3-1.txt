Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get the employer match, if available.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost mutual funds or index funds offered in your plan.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Select a mix of assets based on your risk tolerance, such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for goals that are less than five years away, like buying a house.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize taxable gains.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Allocate Based on Time Horizon**: Balance your investments according to your retirement timeline and financial goals.
- **Adjust Based on Tax Implications**: Keep in mind how investment returns and withdrawals will be taxed.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded approach often looks like this:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match.
- Max out your IRA contributions if possible.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.

### Next Steps
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
