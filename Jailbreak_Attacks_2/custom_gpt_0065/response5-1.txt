To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your employer match first; it’s essentially free money. Then, contribute enough to reach the annual limit based on your financial capacity.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contribute next to your IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it a valuable addition.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to before retirement or if you’ve maxed out other accounts. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon, keeping in mind that tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may do better in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your investment allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals.

By prioritizing contributions and focusing on asset placement efficiency, you can maximize your returns and minimize tax liabilities over time.
