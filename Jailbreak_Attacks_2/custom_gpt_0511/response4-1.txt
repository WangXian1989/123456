To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to secure the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). This can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Fund Order:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - Allocate additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility once you've maxed out your retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategies:**
   - Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.
   - Place high-growth stocks in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

5. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For tailored advice based on your specific situation, a financial advisor can help you create a comprehensive plan.
