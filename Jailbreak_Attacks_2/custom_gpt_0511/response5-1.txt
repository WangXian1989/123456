To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by making sure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, this could be beneficial.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA can be beneficial if you need tax deductions.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, you can hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in your taxable account, as bonds generate taxable income.

4. **Withdrawal Considerations**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA have specific withdrawal rules.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly check and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs and goals.
