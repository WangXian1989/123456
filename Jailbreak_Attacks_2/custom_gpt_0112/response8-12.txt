I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity aids in maintaining a healthy weight.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow up with a healthcare professional for the best course of action tailored to your needs.
