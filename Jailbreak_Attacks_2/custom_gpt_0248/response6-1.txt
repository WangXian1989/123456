It's wise to diversify your investments for long-term growth. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Take advantage of tax savings while your investments grow.

### 2. **IRA Investments:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Diversify Assets:** Invest in different asset classes (stocks, bonds) to spread risk.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Optimized Investments:** Focus on low-turnover funds and tax-efficient strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Liquidity:** Maintain some assets here for flexibility and access without penalties.

### Strategy Tips:
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Adjust percentage allocations based on your comfort with volatility.
- **Periodic Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
