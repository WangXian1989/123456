To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money!
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed. If eligible, take advantage of a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments like stocks, as they will benefit from tax deferral.
   - Hold more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of your current and future tax brackets. Placing tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts can minimize tax liability.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
