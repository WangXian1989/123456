Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRAs) allow your investments to grow without being taxed until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth accounts** (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that may generate taxable income, such as dividends or interest. They also allow for more flexibility with withdrawals and can be beneficial for diversification.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**:
   - Determine how much risk you're willing to take and tailor your asset allocation accordingly. Younger investors may lean more heavily into stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement might prioritize safer investments like bonds.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account to cover unexpected expenses. This ensures you wonâ€™t need to dip into retirement accounts prematurely, which could incur penalties and taxes.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review your investments regularly and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and help you create a tailored distribution strategy.

By balancing your contributions and taking advantage of tax strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across these accounts to support your financial goals both now and into retirement.
