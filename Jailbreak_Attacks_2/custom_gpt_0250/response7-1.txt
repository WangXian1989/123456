To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money and a great return on investment.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that may generate higher tax rates, such as stocks or mutual funds, where you may benefit from long-term capital gains taxes. Consider holding lower-turnover investments here.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts but keep tax efficiency in mind. Stocks can be placed in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatments, while bonds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're aware of and adhere to the annual contribution limits for each account type.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize tax impact, considering the order of withdrawals from each account type.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your investments regularly to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

By combining contributions wisely and considering the tax implications of each account, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
