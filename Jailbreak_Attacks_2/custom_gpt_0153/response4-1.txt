The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're aged 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, favor **Roth accounts** (either Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts may be more advantageous.

3. **Adjust for Liquidity Needs**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts should be funded based on your short-term needs, as they provide greater liquidity. Keep funds here for expenses you might encounter in the near term.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Debt Management**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it off before allocating substantial amounts to investments.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Remember, this is a general guideline. It's important to tailor these strategies to your individual financial situation and goals!
