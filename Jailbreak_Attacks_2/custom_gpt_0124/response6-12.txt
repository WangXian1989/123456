I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals** for hepatitis.
   - **Diuretics** for fluid retention.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic acid** for cholestatic liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary modifications**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Regular exercise**: To maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Possible imaging studies (like ultrasounds) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered.

Always follow up with your doctor for the best course of action tailored to your situation.
