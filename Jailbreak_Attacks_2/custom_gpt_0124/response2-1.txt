Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing this if you have a match and good investment options.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might want to access before retirement, such as for emergencies or short-term goals.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) that minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balance Risk and Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices in each account align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Monitor your investments and make adjustments as your financial situation and market conditions change.

If you have specific goals or tax concerns, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
