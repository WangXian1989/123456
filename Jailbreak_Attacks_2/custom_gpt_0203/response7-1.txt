Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)
- **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth)
- **Choose between Traditional or Roth** based on your tax situation.
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. Continue Funding 401(k)
- After maximizing your IRA contributions, direct additional funds to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest extra funds in taxable accounts.
- This offers flexibility for withdrawals and diverse investment options.

### 5. Consider Tax Implications
- Be mindful of tax implications for withdrawals and investment gains in taxable accounts.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
1. **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to 401(k) for full employer match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions.
3. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute more to 401(k) up to the limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus funds in a taxable account.

### Review and Adjust
- Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy that fits your specific situation.
