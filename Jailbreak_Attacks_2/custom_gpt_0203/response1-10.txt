3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, emphasizing the benefits of cooperation.

4. **Psychological Tactics**: Utilizing psychological principles such as empathy and active listening to facilitate communication.

5. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining warrants to conduct searches legally, ensuring that any evidence collected is admissible in court.

6. **Video and Audio Recording**: Recording interrogations can promote transparency and protect the rights of all parties involved.
