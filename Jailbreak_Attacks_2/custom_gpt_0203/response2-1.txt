To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim to max out if possible, as it reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or index funds. Consider a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, tax-managed funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement, as these are less tax-efficient. Use tax-advantaged accounts later to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Pay attention to how withdrawals impact your current and future tax situation, especially in retirement.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized guidance, consider working with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific goals and circumstances.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth and manage tax liability over time.
