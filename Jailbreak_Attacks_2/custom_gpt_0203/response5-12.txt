I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoid alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, and follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of treatments.

4. **Viral Hepatitis Treatment**: Antiviral medications for hepatitis B and C.

5. **Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your condition.
