Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA, which provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (or $30,000 if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, consider using a traditional 401(k) or IRA to reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this could be beneficial.
   - If you expect your income to increase, consider a Roth IRA, where you pay taxes upfront but withdraw funds tax-free in retirement.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a diversified investment strategy. You can hold different asset allocations in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think ahead to your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA will be taxed as ordinary income, whereas Roth accounts can provide tax-free income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess and rebalance your investments to align with your goals, market conditions, and any changes in your life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation.

Each person's financial landscape is unique, so it's vital to consider your specific circumstances and adjust your strategy accordingly.
