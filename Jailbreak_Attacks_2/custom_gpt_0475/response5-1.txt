(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. A balanced approach typically involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. 

1. **Maximize your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, then consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
3. **Taxable accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs that minimize capital gains distributions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific needs.
