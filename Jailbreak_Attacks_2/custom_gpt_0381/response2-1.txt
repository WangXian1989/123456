Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. IRAs can offer tax advantages that might benefit you based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Maximize 401(k)**: If you can still invest more after contributing to your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, ensure your investments are well-diversified to manage risk. Consider including a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve, making adjustments as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
