The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes employer matching; contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts; Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Brokerage accounts where investments are taxed as you sell; suitable for more flexible access to funds.

2. **Set Financial Goals**:
   - Identify your short, medium, and long-term financial goals to guide your investment strategy.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Consider your current tax bracket and how it might change in the future. Generally, it’s often beneficial to contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first.

4. **Start with Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

5. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After getting the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (if eligible).
   - If you are eligible for a Roth IRA and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing this account for its tax-free growth potential.

6. **Consider Investment Options and Costs**:
   - Compare the investment options available in each account, especially in your 401(k). Some plans may have high fees or limited choices.

7. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

8. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary, considering market conditions and your evolving financial situation.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies specifically to your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can develop a balanced strategy that maximizes growth while considering tax implications.
