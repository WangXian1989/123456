Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may not be as tax-efficient (e.g., stocks with potential for long-term capital gains).
   - Taxable accounts also offer liquidity for immediate goals (e.g., buying a home).

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on the account type. Higher-risk investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts to grow tax-free, while more stable investments might be suitable for taxable accounts.
   
### 4. **Estate Planning Considerations**
   - Consider that taxable accounts can receive a "step-up" in basis at death, which can minimize capital gains taxes for heirs.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (max out employer match).
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds based on your goals and needs (e.g., 20-30% of total savings).

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
