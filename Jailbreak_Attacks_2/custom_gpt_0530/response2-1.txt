To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start there. Aim to contribute enough to secure the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. It's beneficial for higher-income years.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax advantages apply. Choose a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you won’t receive tax benefits here, this account offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

3. **Investment Horizon**: Your time frame matters:
   - Long-term (10+ years): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Short-term (under 10 years): Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment mix based on your risk profile within each account.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your account balances and allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation, consulting a professional can provide valuable insights.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial goals, income level, and tax situation.
