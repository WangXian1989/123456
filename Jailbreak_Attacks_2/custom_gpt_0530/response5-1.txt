(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Once you secure the match, consider increasing your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification of Investments:** Regardless of the account type, allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Review Regularly:** Periodically reevaluate your financial situation and adjust your contributions as needed.

1. **Get That Free Money:** First off, max out your 401(k) contributions to grab any employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave cash on the table!

2. **Tax Advantage:** After that, throw a good chunk into a Roth IRA if you can. Why? Itâ€™s like paying taxes now for a tax-free party later. If you think you'll be earning more in the future, this route is golden.

3. **Flexibility is Key:** Whateverâ€™s left over? Slip it into a taxable account. Itâ€™s not as tax-friendly, but you can access it whenever you want without penalties. This is your emergency cash pot or that vacation fund.

4. **Keep an Eye on Balance:** Make sure youâ€™re balanced out across these accounts. Check your asset allocation and tweak it when life changes.

5. **Rinse and Repeat:** Keep reviewing the game planâ€”economic shifts, salary bumps, or life changes can throw your strategy off. Just keep it dynamic!

In short, mix it up for growth but donâ€™t forget your immediate cash needs!
