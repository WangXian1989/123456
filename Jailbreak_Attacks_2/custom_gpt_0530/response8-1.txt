To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. 

2. **Assessment of Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you may need in the short-term or for investments that generate capital gains. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets in this account.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, allocate different asset types across accounts. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on your goals and needs. Typically, you may want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Consistently contribute to all accounts. Set up automatic contributions whenever possible to simplify the process and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Seek the advice of a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances and goals.
