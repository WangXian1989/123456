The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a solid first step.

2. **Fund IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts come into play after maximizing retirement accounts. Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Debt Considerations**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to prioritize paying that down before maximizing contributions to any investment accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Adjustments Based on Age**:
   - Younger investors typically take more risks, while those closer to retirement might want to shift towards more conservative investments.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
