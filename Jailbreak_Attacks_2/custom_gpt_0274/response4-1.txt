To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Growth**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Diversity in Tax Treatment**: Use a Traditional IRA if you want to reduce taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on long-term growth investments here to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

### General Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment choices based on your risk tolerance.
- **Investment Goals**: Identify short-term versus long-term goals to prioritize account funding.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### Suggested Order of Contributions:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match.
2. Max out an IRA (Roth or Traditional, based on your situation).
3. Increase contributions to your 401(k) or use any remaining funds for taxable accounts.

Consult a financial advisor for a plan tailored to your individual situation.
