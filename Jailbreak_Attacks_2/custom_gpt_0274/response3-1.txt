Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Once you’ve maximized your IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re under 50. For those over 50, consider catch-up contributions.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation in each account based on your overall investment strategy and market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of each account. Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are not taxed.

7. **Plan for Distribution**:
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider how you’ll draw from each account. A tax-efficient withdrawal strategy can save money in taxes.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 30**:
  - 401(k): 10% of income.
  - IRA: Max out contribution ($6,500).
  - Taxable: Save any extra for short-term goals.

- **Age 50**:
  - 401(k): 15% of income (including catch-up contributions).
  - IRA: Max out contribution.
  - Taxable: Build savings for early retirement if desired.

Tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation and goals, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
