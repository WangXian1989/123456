Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k):** 
   - Maximize employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to reach the maximum annual limit (2023 limit: $22,500, or $30,000 if over 50).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions for tax diversification.
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it allows tax-free growth and withdrawals; consider this for younger investors.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for short to medium-term goals (like buying a home or funding education).
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have adequate savings set aside in a high-yield savings account.
2. **401(k) to Max Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
3. **Maximize 401(k):** Contribute to reach the maximum limit.
4. **Contribute to IRA:** Max out IRA contributions next, picking between traditional or Roth based on your tax strategy.
5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any additional savings here, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Additional Considerations
- **Tax Implications:** Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding between traditional vs. Roth accounts.
- **Retirement Age:** Adjust contributions based on how close you are to retirement, potentially shifting more towards safer investments as you age.

Consult with a financial advisor to customize this strategy and ensure it aligns with your specific situation.
