Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider using a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and future tax expectations.
   - **401(k)**: If your employer’s plan has good investment options and low fees, aim to max this out next.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, put additional savings into taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility and access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and investment styles (growth, value).

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) and consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### Example Allocation Plan
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.

### Regular Review
Always reassess your strategy annually or after major life changes.
