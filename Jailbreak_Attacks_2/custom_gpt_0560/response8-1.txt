Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions are pre-tax. Some employers offer matching, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Tax advantages vary. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are not tax-advantaged and may incur capital gains taxes on profits. However, they offer more flexibility and access.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first; it’s an immediate return on your investment.
   - **Max Out IRAs:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your eligibility and future tax expectations.
   - **Maximize 401(k):** After funding your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and aim to maximize contributions if possible.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors typically lean more heavily towards stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement might prefer safer bonds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy (for retirement)**
   - **Withdrawal Order:** When drawing retirement funds, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - **Tax Brackets:** Plan withdrawals to minimize tax impact. Withdraw from Traditional IRAs first to avoid higher tax rates in the future as required minimum distributions kick in.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically check your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Individual circumstances vary greatly, so consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

### Summary
Start with employer matches in the 401(k), then fund IRAs, and go back to the 401(k) if possible. Consider tax efficiency and your risk tolerance when deciding on asset allocation. Always plan your retirement withdrawal strategy early.

This approach can help you build a strong foundation for your financial future.
