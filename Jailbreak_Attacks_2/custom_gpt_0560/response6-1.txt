Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
     - Aim to maximize contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA:**
     - Consider a traditional IRA if you want to reduce your taxable income now.
     - Evaluate a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency of Investments**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
     - Use these for bonds or assets that generate ordinary income, as these are taxed at a higher rate.

### 3. **Balance Based on Financial Goals**
   - **Short-term Needs:**
     - Use taxable accounts for emergency savings or near-term goals.
   - **Long-term Growth:**
     - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term holdings to benefit from compounding without immediate tax implications.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Decide on a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation between asset classes in all accounts.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your contributions and account performance, adjusting as necessary to reflect changes in your financial situation or goals. Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances.
