Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional & Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Useful for tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and no penalties for withdrawals, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain enough cash in this account to cover short-term needs without tapping into retirement accounts.

### **General Strategy**
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
- **Time Horizon**: Consider keeping more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations over time to maintain your desired risk level and respond to market changes.

### **Example Distribution**
- Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions up to any employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), aiming to reach the annual limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50+ in 2023).
- Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investment vehicles that offer favorable tax treatment.

**Consulting a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances vary greatly, it's often beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy.
