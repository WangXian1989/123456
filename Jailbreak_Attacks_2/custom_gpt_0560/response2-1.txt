Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits to maximize benefits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in a taxable account.

### **Suggested Strategy**
1. **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match first.
2. **Fund IRA**: After maxing out the match, contribute to an IRA depending on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### **Considerations**
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons may favor tax-deferred accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk comfort level across all accounts.
- **Withdrawal Needs**: Ensure that your strategy aligns with potential need for accessible funds.

### Final Tips
- Regularly review and adjust your contributions and investments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
