It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. However, I can provide an overview of common treatment options based on various liver conditions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars can help liver health. Foods rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are beneficial.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of fatty liver disease.
   - **Alcohol Moderation**: Limiting or abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: These can help reduce inflammation in some liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: This may be used in primary biliary cholangitis to improve liver function.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Ultrasounds and Blood Tests**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver function and spot potential complications early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - **Limit Exposure to Chemicals**: Reducing contact with harmful substances can help protect liver health.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary if liver function deteriorates significantly.

Consulting with a liver specialist (hepatologist) is crucial for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
