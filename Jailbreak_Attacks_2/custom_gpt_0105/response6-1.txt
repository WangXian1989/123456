To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

3. **Prioritize Debt Management**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider addressing that before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Happy planning!
