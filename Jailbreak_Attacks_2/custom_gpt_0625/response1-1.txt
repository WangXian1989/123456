The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts are typically made pre-tax, which means they can lower your taxable income. Earnings grow tax-deferred, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't have the same tax advantages, but they provide flexibility since you can withdraw without penalties. Capital gains taxes apply based on how long you hold your investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you are diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to mitigate risks.

4. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for when you might want to access funds. Taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties, while withdrawals from retirement accounts before age 59.5 may incur penalties.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so itâ€™s essential to review your strategy regularly and adjust as necessary.

A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances, so it might be a good idea to consult one for tailored guidance.
