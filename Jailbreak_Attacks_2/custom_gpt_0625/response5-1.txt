(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and needs. Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Finally, any additional savings can be allocated to taxable accounts. The key is to consider factors like your current tax bracket, expected future income, investment goals, and your time horizon for accessing the funds.

After youâ€™ve snagged that free loot, dive into that IRA! You can go traditional for the tax break today or rock a Roth for tax-free growth like a champ when you retire. Once youâ€™ve maxed those out, throw whateverâ€™s left over into taxable accounts. Just keep in mind that capital gains might hit you when you sell, but hey, if you play your cards right, you could offset that with some sneak attacks like tax-loss harvesting. It's all about balance, so assess your goals, risk tolerance, and time frame! ðŸ’°ðŸŽ‰
