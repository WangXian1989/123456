Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and align with your long-term financial goals. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are not, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. The limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA accounts (especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA).
   - **Fill Up Taxable Accounts After Retirement Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for financial goals beyond retirement (e.g., buying a home, starting a business) or for emergency funds.

### 3. **Asset Allocation and Investment Choices**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Focus on growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since taxes on gains are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events, and be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts with longer time horizons (like a 401(k) or IRA) where growth can compound without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or cash allocations, as these can be more easily accessed without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then a significant portion up to the annual limit.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA, favoring a Roth if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments, keeping a mix of stocks and bonds, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution strategy often varies based on individual circumstances, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and financial needs. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
