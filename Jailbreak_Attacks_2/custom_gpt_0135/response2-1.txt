Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here’s a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: This is typically a employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Growth is tax-deferred.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k) but with different contribution limits and more investment options. You can choose a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts where capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if your employer plan offers low-cost investment options.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: 
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - Aim to reach the maximum contribution limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments once you’ve maximized retirement accounts.
   - Consider investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**

- **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure you have a diversified mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: 
  - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
  - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Review and Rebalance**

- **Regularly Review Your Allocation**: Adjust your contributions based on changes in tax laws, income, and market conditions.
- **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Ensure your investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Long-Term Planning**

- **Consider Future Withdrawals**: Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Roth accounts might provide tax-free income, while 401(k) and traditional IRAs will be taxed upon withdrawal.

### Summary

1. Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions (especially to get the employer match).
2. Contribute to an IRA, balancing between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
3. After maxing retirement contributions, invest in a taxable account with an eye on tax efficiency.
4. Diversify your investments and regularly review your strategies to stay aligned with your financial goals.

Developing a well-rounded strategy not only aids in maximizing your savings but also positions you for financial stability and growth in retirement. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
