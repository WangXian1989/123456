The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Max Out IRAs:**
   - Consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) next. IRAs often offer tax advantages that can benefit you in the long run.

### 3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before investing.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility in withdrawals. This can be useful for goals other than retirement.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of the tax implications of your investments, particularly in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 7. **Reevaluate Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Recommended Ratios:
- A common approach might be 15-20% in 401(k), 10-15% in IRAs, and the rest in taxable accounts. Adjust based on personal circumstances.

### Resources:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation. Tools like retirement calculators can also help project future growth and needs.
