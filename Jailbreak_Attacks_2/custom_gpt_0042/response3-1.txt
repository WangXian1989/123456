Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions for tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Ideal for higher-income years as contributions lower taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds needed in the near term or for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to manage risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider the order of withdrawals during retirement. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first for lower tax impact.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocation based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
