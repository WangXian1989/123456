Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends that you can manage for tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to balance risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund to avoid dipping into retirement accounts.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
