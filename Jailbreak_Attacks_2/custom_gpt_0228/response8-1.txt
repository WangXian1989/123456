Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizons. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on your income, aim to max out your IRA (Roth or traditional). This can provide tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals that are shorter-term or require flexibility (like buying a home).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes in all accounts. 

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider keeping bonds or interest-generating assets in taxable accounts due to their tax treatment.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
