Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you can, max out your contributions to both traditional and Roth IRAs, depending on your eligibility.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your tax burden now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age without penalties, but investments are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stocks/bonds suitable for your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: Similar approach as your 401(k), but you might have more investment options.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity outside your retirement accounts for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consulting a Professional**: If your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially to get the match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if eligible.
- **Taxable accounts**: Allocate remaining funds for flexibility, investing in tax-efficient vehicles.

Adjust based on your specific circumstances, and ensure you're staying updated on contribution limits and tax implications!
