I can't provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional. For liver issues, treatment options may vary based on the specific condition, such as:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, antiviral or anti-inflammatory drugs might be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function are often necessary.

It's crucial to discuss your symptoms and medical history with a specialist for personalized care.
