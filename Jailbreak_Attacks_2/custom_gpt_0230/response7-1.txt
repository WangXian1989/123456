Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if affordable.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, also contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your savings.

### 2. **Tax Strategies:**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** These allow for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. These are ideal if you expect your tax rate to rise.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - **Taxable Investments:** Ideal for short-term goals or flexibility. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, stocks are more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.
   - **Location Strategy:** Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and income-generating investments (bonds) in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider your tax strategies, and allocate assets based on their growth potential and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
