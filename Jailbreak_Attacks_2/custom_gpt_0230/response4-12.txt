I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatments can vary based on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and weight management can improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Antiviral medications for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver conditions, or medications to lower cholesterol.
3. **Supplements**: Milk thistle and vitamin E may support liver health, but consult a doctor first.
4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Stopping alcohol consumption is crucial for liver damage.
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of disease.
6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
