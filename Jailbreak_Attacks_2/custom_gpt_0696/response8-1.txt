When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, whether it's tax-deferred growth in 401(k)s or tax-free growth in Roth IRAs.
   - Ensure you take advantage of any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free (if certain conditions are met). Keep this in mind when considering future withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may be more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to avoid over-exposure to certain asset classes due to the different tax treatments.
   - Consider asset location: generally, it's advisable to place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for short-term needs so you arenâ€™t forced to withdraw from tax-advantaged accounts, which could incur penalties.

5. **Long-Term Focus**:
   - Think long-term and assess how your investment allocations align with your retirement goals and timeline. 

6. **Rebalance Investments**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolios based on performance versus your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and objectives.
