Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general principles to guide you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These will be taxed on dividends and capital gains, but they offer flexibility and no penalties for early withdrawal.

3. **Emergency Fund First:** Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a liquid account, typically covering 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

4. **Debt Considerations:** If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to prioritize paying that off before aggressively investing.

5. **Retirement Timeline:** If you’re closer to retirement, you might prioritize your 401(k) and IRAs for their tax advantages. If you’re younger, a mix of Roth IRA might be beneficial for tax-free growth.

6. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider other factors such as age, financial goals, and market outlook. 

7. **Periodic Review:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Combine these strategies based on your context for optimal distribution. If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
