When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach to guide you:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, aim to max out contributions to your IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits (traditional or Roth). This can help grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred, depending on the account type.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility, as you can access your money without penalties and choose investments based on your tax situation (e.g., prioritizing tax-efficient investments).

4. **Investment Allocation**: Consider how to allocate your investments in these accounts. Generally, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while placing less tax-efficient investments (like bond funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: As your investment goals and market conditions change, review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach for your situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial picture.

Each individual's financial situation is unique, so itâ€™s vital to consider your specific goals, time frame, and risk tolerance while planning. Let me know if youâ€™d like to dive deeper into any specific area! ðŸ˜Š
