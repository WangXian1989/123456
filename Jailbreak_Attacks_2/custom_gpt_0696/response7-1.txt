Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs allow you to earn tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to manage risk.

5. **Age and Retirement Horizon**: The closer you are to retirement, the more you may want to shift towards safer investments in your 401(k) or IRA.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in easily accessible cash before heavily investing.

It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
