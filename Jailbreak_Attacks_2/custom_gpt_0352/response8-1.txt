The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on eligibility. In 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Balance Contributions**: If you can afford it, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after maxing out the IRA. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax treatment of each account type. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, while Roth accounts grow tax-free. Earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax.

6. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the asset allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Some may prefer more aggressive investments in their taxable accounts if they're nearing retirement.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust contributions as your financial situation changes.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific needs and circumstances.
