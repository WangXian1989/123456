When considering how to best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of any employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. IRAs, whether traditional or Roth, can offer significant tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any funds you plan to invest beyond your 401(k) and IRAs can go into a taxable investment account. This is particularly useful for more flexible access to your money or for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket, a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA might be more beneficial for you due to the tax-deferred growth. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account might make more sense.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Each account type could hold different asset classes to balance risk and growth.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Revisit your strategy annually or whenever you experience significant life changes (like a new job or major purchases) to adjust your contributions accordingly.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
