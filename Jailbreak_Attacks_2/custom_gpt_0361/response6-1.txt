When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach that maximizes tax advantages and aligns with your overall financial goals. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim for the maximum contribution limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA aligns better with your tax situation. Contribute the maximum allowed amount to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Once your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider allocating additional funds to a taxable account. This provides greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize your tax obligations on investments held in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts, but consider placing more growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth will not be taxed until withdrawal, and bond investments in taxable accounts to shield interest income from higher taxes.
  
4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance periodically to maintain your desired risk level, taking into consideration changes in market conditions.

By strategically distributing your investments and utilizing the unique benefits of each account type, you can enhance your overall financial health and optimize your wealth accumulation potential.
