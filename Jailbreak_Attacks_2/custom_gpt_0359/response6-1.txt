To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to fully fund a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax strategy.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Bond Investments**: Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax liabilities on interest income.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Align the asset allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance. 
   - Younger investors may prefer aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRA, while more conservative allocations can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your savings while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
