Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on this account.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your income to grow significantly, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Great for tax deductions if you qualify, especially if your income is high.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. Use this for short-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your money distribution based on your needs and financial objectives.
