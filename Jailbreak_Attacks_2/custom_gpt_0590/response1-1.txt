When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on individual financial goals, tax situations, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Contributions to these accounts often grow tax-deferred, and with Roth IRAs, you may withdraw tax-free in retirement. 

3. **Consider Tax Brackets:** If you are in a higher tax bracket now but expect to be in a lower one during retirement, traditional accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) can be beneficial, allowing for tax deductions now with income tax paid later upon withdrawal. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to increase, a Roth IRA might be a better choice.

4. **Diversify Contributions:** Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider spreading your contributions across different types of accounts to balance tax benefits and withdrawal flexibility.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you may consider putting additional savings into a taxable account. These accounts provide greater liquidity and flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties.

6. **Investment Choices:** Within these accounts, diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific goals, needs, and risk tolerance.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so it's crucial to evaluate your own circumstances and perhaps seek personalized advice.
