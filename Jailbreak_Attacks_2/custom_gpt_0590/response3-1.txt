Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit for tax benefits (as of 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial for medium-term savings or specific goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, you might invest more aggressively in accounts meant for long-term growth (like a Roth IRA) and be more conservative in accounts where you expect to withdraw funds sooner.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation or goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and investment choices, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Make sure to assess your entire financial picture and adjust these strategies based on your specific circumstances and objectives.
