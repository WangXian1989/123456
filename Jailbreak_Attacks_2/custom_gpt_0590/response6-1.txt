Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your tax situation, retirement timeline, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as this allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** These accounts provide tax advantages now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Diversify Investments Appropriately:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to grow significantly, as the tax impact at withdrawal will be greater.
   - Maintain more liquid and possibly less volatile investments in taxable accounts for easier access if needed.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Investment Horizon:**
   - Younger investors might focus on growth within tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift towards income-generating assets.
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

### 5. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits and Rules:**
   - Keep track of annual contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts, as exceeding these can lead to penalties.

By carefully analyzing your financial situation, adjusting your investment strategies based on age and goals, and understanding the tax implications, you can create an efficient distribution plan for your money across these accounts. It may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
