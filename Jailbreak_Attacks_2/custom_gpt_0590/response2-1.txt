When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially free money. If you can afford to, maximize your contributions to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (to the extent that you receive a match), consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments, but you have more flexibility regarding withdrawals.

3. **Diversification Across Account Types:**
   - Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help manage tax implications and risk over time. For instance, placing more conservative investments in tax-advantaged accounts can defer taxes, while high-growth investments might perform better in a Roth IRA or taxable account.

4. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon:**
   - Your age and when you plan to retire can dictate how aggressively you should invest. Younger savers might prioritize growth-focused investments, while those nearing retirement might want to reduce risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - When it's time to withdraw funds, having a strategy for which account to withdraw from first can help minimize taxes. Generally, it may be beneficial to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to keep growing.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments:**
   - Your financial situation and goals can change, so itâ€™s essential to regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment strategies as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor these strategies to your unique situation and create a comprehensive plan that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
