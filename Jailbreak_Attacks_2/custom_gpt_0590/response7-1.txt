To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** This employer-sponsored retirement account typically allows pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Employers may also offer matching contributions, which are essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Both Traditional IRAs (which are tax-deductible) and Roth IRAs (where withdrawals in retirement are tax-free) should be prioritized based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold, as well as taxes on dividends and interest earned.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this represents an immediate return on investment.
   - Next, consider funding an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, since it offers tax-free growth.
   - After maxing out those accounts, use any remaining funds to invest in taxable accounts. This strategy ensures you benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts first.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) might be more suitable for taxable accounts to avoid higher tax liabilities on interest income.

4. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor your investment performance and contribution limits each year. Adjust your allocations based on any changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can help create a tailored strategy considering your personal circumstances, goals, and the most recent tax regulations.

This strategy can help you maximize your savings and minimize your tax liabilities over time.
