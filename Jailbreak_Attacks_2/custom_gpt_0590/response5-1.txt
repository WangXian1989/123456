(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors, including your income, tax bracket, financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth over time. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out your contributions to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Here, consider long-term capital gains and tax-efficient investing strategies.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it may also be wise to consult with a financial advisor.
