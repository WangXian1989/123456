I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), antiviral medications or other drugs may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and damage.

4. **Supplements**: Some might benefit from supplements like vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
