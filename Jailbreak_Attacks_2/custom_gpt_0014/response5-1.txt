To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Investment Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term goals. This will influence asset allocation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, and investments grow tax-deferred. Aim for tax-efficient investments here.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax advantages, but consider if a traditional or Roth IRA suits you better based on future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. 

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, which can affect where you should hold different assets.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

A balanced approach might involve maxing out the employer match in your 401(k) first, then contributing to an IRA, and using taxable accounts for additional investments. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
