To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, aim to contribute to your IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and may be taxed at lower rates on long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Growth vs. Stability**
   - Put higher-risk, higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where you can defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, as youâ€™ll be taxed on dividends and interest.

### 4. **Adjust for Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure you have enough in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as these can be accessed without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial goals or risk tolerance.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% (up to employer match)
- **IRA**: 10%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10% (after maxing 401(k) and IRA contributions)
- **Growth Investments**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts
- **Stable Investments**: Use taxable accounts for fixed income or cash equivalents

### Conclusion
This approach balances maximizing tax advantages while allowing for flexibility and liquidity. Always consider your overall financial goals and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
