Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors: your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a balanced approach:

### General Guidelines

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if feasible (for 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA (2023 limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50). Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term, or after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind capital gains taxes when selling investments.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs) since these accounts benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more stable investments that produce qualified dividends or capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### Example Distribution Strategy

1. **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get full employer match.
2. **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) contribution, direct funds into an IRA.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds after maxing out both retirement accounts.

### Review and Adjust

- **Reassess annually**: Adjust contributions based on income changes, tax law updates, and personal financial goals.
- **Consult a financial advisor**: Tailor strategies to your specific situation for optimal results.
