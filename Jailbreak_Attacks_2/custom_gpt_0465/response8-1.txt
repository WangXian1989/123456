The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for withdrawals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral (and tax-free growth in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying it down first before heavily investing in these retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Allocate investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to achieve the risk level suitable for your goals.

5. **Tax Strategies for Withdrawals**: Consider future tax implications. For instance, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it may be beneficial to prioritize Roth accounts, which allow for tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Flexibility with Taxable Accounts**: Maintain some liquidity through taxable accounts for short-term needs, as withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts can incur penalties or tax implications.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
