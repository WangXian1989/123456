I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes eliminating alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation or surgery for tumors may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
