To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Account Types**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
     - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket. Evaluate the fees and investment options.
     - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies. Typically, this is outside of these retirement accounts.

### 4. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This can include stocks, bonds, or ETFs.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, keeping tax implications in mind:
     - **Tax-inefficient assets** (like bonds) may be better in tax-deferred accounts.
     - **Tax-efficient assets** (like stocks) can be held in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to fit your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to managing and distributing your money across different accounts.
