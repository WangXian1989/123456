Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Consider a Roth for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA before adding funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Evaluate Investment Choices**:
   - 401(k) plans often have limited investment options. If they offer lower-cost index funds, those can be a good choice.
   - Use your IRA and taxable accounts for more diverse or higher-risk investments, as they provide more flexibility.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund separate from these accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on market changes, your age, and how close you are to retirement to ensure alignment with your goals.

6. **Long-Term Perspective**:
   - Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term fluctuations, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

Personalizing your strategy based on your circumstances will yield the best results. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
