To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Focus on maxing employer matching if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected retirement tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed annually on capital gains and dividends. Use them for investments that generate lower taxes over time, like index funds.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Ideal for long-term growth with higher risk tolerance assets (e.g., stocks) due to their tax-advantaged nature.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid, short-term goals or to hold assets that would generate unfavorable tax treatment in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Avoid over-concentrating in one account type.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice can help optimize your distribution strategy based on your specific situation and goals.

By considering these elements, you can create a balanced approach to investing across your accounts.
