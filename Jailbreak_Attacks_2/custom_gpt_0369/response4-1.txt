To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRA accounts for your age. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

4. **Weigh Tax Implications**:
   - Invest more heavily in tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts, while placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
