To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - Max out any employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Choose investment options with lower fees and good historical performance.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you need immediate tax deductions, contribute to a Traditional IRA instead, but be mindful of income limitations.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses.

4. **Overall Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk.
   - Adjust allocations based on your age, retirement goals, and market conditions.
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
