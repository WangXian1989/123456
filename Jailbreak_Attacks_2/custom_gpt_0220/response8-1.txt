Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Priority Contributions**: After maximizing the employer match, consider the following order:
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income and eligibility, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for potential tax advantages.
   - **401(k)**: Increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, particularly if you can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use surplus funds for taxable accounts if you have already contributed sufficiently to tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Taxes**: 
   - Traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) provide tax deferrals, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - Roth accounts let you withdraw tax-free at retirement, making them attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Taxable accounts donâ€™t offer tax benefits, but capital gains taxes can be managed through long-term investments.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to manage risk effectively.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.
