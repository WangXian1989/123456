To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you exceed contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax burden.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Adjust your investment mix based on your risk tolerance, age, and retirement timeline. Generally, equities for growth in your 401(k) and IRAs, and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investment allocations annually to align them with your financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
