Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, focus on Roth accounts.

4. **Diversify Account Types**: Have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts for flexibility in retirement.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you're younger and have a long time until retirement, you might take on more risk in your taxable accounts, investing in higher-growth assets.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds during retirement, considering tax implications.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

In general, a well-rounded approach considers both short-term and long-term financial needs while effectively managing tax implications.
