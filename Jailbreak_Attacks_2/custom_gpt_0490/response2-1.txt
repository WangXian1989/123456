Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement, making them ideal for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can help manage tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for short-term goals or if you plan to invest in assets that generate capital gains or dividends, as taxes on these can vary.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance within each account. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out your contributions if possible.
- **Taxable Account**: Consider the remainder of your savings here, focusing on long-term investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds).

Assess your overall financial picture to adjust these strategies based on personal circumstances.
