Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off high-interest debts before maximizing retirement accounts.

3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: After your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, benefiting from tax advantages.

4. **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts. This provides more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon, making sure to balance stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax implications of withdrawals; IRAs and 401(k)s have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts offer more flexibility.

8. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly based on changing financial situations and goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
