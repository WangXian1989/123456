Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach. Here are some key factors to consider:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions (2023 limit: $22,500, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - Contribute to your IRA (2023 limit: $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA offers tax deduction on contributions, while Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Growth is taxed at capital gains rates, potentially lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals, consider taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio distribution as market conditions and personal circumstances change.

### Suggested Strategy:

1. **Max Out 401(k)** contributions if employer matching is available.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** for additional tax benefits.
3. Use **taxable accounts** for funds needed in the short to medium term or for more flexible investment choices.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your investments.
