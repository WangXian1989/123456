To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your IRA contributions, funnel more money into your 401(k), especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or for investments that generate lower tax implications (like index funds or municipal bonds).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Assess your strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
