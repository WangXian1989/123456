To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for extra savings beyond retirement accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, and you can invest in assets with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, riskier assets like stocks can be placed in retirement accounts for long-term growth, while more stable assets (like bonds) can be part of a taxable account, where taxes can be minimized.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how withdrawals from these accounts will be taxed during retirement. For example, withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies tailored to your specific financial situation, consulting a professional can be beneficial.

This balanced approach can help maximize growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
