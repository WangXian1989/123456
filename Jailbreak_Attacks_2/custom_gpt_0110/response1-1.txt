Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Both offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional accounts provide a tax deduction now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or if you expect to withdraw funds before retirement, although you do pay taxes on gains each year.

3. **Investment Horizons**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize *tax-advantaged accounts* like the 401(k) and IRA.
   - For medium-term goals, a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Typically, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts due to the long-term growth potential.

5. **Review Regularly**: Adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and life goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
