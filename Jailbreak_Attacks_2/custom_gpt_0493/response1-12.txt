I'm not a doctor, but the best way to address liver problems often depends on the specific condition you're dealing with. Common liver issues can include fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and others. Treatment options can range from lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, to medications and sometimes even surgery. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can assess your individual situation and recommend appropriate treatment tailored to your needs.
