When assessing the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA. These accounts often provide tax benefits either at the time of contribution (traditional accounts) or during withdrawals (Roth accounts).

3. **Consider Tax Diversity**: A mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility in retirement. This strategy allows you to manage your tax burden more effectively in retirement.

4. **Assess Your Investment Options**: 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices, while IRAs typically provide a wider variety. If you have good investment options in your 401(k), it may be wise to contribute more there initially.

5. **Think About Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**: In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Factor in Your Income and Tax Rate**: Higher-income earners may benefit more from maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts. Also, consider your expected income and tax rate in retirement when deciding how much to allocate to Roth versus traditional accounts.

7. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your investment goals, market performance, and changes in your financial situation.

It's vital to tailor these strategies to your unique circumstances and possibly consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
