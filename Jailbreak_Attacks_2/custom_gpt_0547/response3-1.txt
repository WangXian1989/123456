Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan offering tax-deferred growth. Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside retirement accounts. They don't have specific tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance. 

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - If eligible, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - Any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts for more flexibility.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed when realized, often at lower rates if held long-term. 

5. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (e.g., stocks) and taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds or index funds).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial circumstances.

This strategy aims to optimize your tax situation, enhance growth potential, and retain liquidity for short-term needs.
