The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and the specific details of each account. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, try to max out your contributions, especially if your income is high.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions upfront.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is typically higher than that for IRAs.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In lower tax brackets, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous since you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later. In higher brackets, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax savings.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio in each account. Consider your risk tolerance and investment time horizon when selecting assets.

### 5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Specific Investments**
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for investments that generate lower taxable income (like municipal bonds) or for holding investments long enough to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Maintain Flexibility and Liquidity**
   - Ensure that you have some liquid assets in your taxable accounts in case of emergencies or other financial needs.

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and tax laws. Adjust contributions according to your evolving goals.

### Conclusion
A personalized approach that considers your financial situation and goals is essential. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a specific strategy tailored to your needs.
