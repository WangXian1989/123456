When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors like your individual financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to help you make a well-informed decision:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider the Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may also provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (given certain conditions).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell them. Interest and dividends may also be taxable.

### 3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) before investing heavily in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Consider how you'll distribute your asset allocation across these accounts. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks.
   - You might choose to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund and consider your short-term financial needs before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 6. **Long-Term Financial Goals**
   - Align your distributions with your long-term financial goals, whether it's retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

### 7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your portfolio and make adjustments based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the "best" distribution strategy really depends on your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan.
