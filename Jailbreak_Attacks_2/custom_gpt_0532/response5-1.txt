(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. However, a general approach could be:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Type of Account**: For long-term growth, use tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA, which can grow tax-deferred. For more flexible access to your funds, consider taxable accounts.
3. **Investment Strategy**: Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments aligned with your goals.
4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocation and rebalance as needed based on market performance and changes in your objectives.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! First off, if you're not throwing some serious cash into that 401(k) up to the employer match, you're basically leaving free money on the tableâ€”what are you doing? After that, sock away as much as you can into a Traditional or Roth IRA because the tax benefits are just too good to ignore.

Now, once you've maxed out those tax-advantaged beauties, then you can throw some cash into taxable accounts for the flexibility. You can invest in whatever you fancy! Just remember, the investment flavor you choose can make or break your financial future. Stocks for the long haul, bonds for stability, and don't forget to check your portfolio regularlyâ€”nobody wants to wake up one day and realize they were sleeping at the wheel! Happy investing!
