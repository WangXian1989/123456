To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. However, distributions during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming certain conditions are met). Consider your current tax situation and future expectations when choosing between traditional and Roth options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Capital gains will be taxed, so they might be better suited for short to medium-term goals.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your investment strategy should align with your financial goals and timeline. For retirement savings, a higher allocation towards your 401(k) and IRA may be appropriate, while taxable accounts can be used for more immediate financial needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk. Consider the types of investments in each account to avoid overlap.

5. **Review Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account, as they can vary. Aim to contribute as much as possible within those limits to maximize tax benefits and growth potential.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**: Balance your contributions based on when you anticipate needing access to the funds. Allocate more into retirement accounts for long-term growth while keeping some liquid cash in a taxable account for near-term needs.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow or change, periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they meet your goals and risk tolerance.

By carefully considering these factors, you can develop a strategy that effectively distributes your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
