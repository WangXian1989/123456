The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be a significant advantage depending on your future tax situation.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your current taxable income but will be taxed upon withdrawal. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but ensure you understand the deduction eligibility based on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can invest beyond retirement accounts. It doesn’t offer the same tax advantages, but it provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Once you have your basics covered, focus on diversifying your investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Generally, you should hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed funds or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance & Adjust According to Life Changes**: Regularly review your investments and contributions. Life events (like marriage, having children, or changing jobs) can necessitate changes in your strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best approach, consider speaking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
