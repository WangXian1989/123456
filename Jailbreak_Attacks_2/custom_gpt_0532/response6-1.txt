When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to effectively allocate your funds:

### 1. Understand the Accounts
- **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that typically comes with tax advantages, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits to 401(k) plans, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, though contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but offer greater flexibility in terms of accessing funds without penalties.

### 2. Optimize Your Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to an IRA, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Allocate Excess Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any excess funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide tax flexibility in retirement.
- **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for over a year to qualify for long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than short-term rates.

### 4. Review Investment Strategy
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider maintaining a balanced portfolio across your accounts. Generally, it makes sense to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (due to the potential for tax-free growth) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

By following these steps and understanding the nuances of each account type, you can strategically distribute your funds in a way that maximizes growth and minimizes tax liabilities over time.
