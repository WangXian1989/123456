(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon until retirement. Here's a general guideline: 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. After that, consider your investment options, fees, and how it fits into your overall asset allocation.

2. **IRA**: IRAs can provide tax advantages that could be beneficial for your retirement savings. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current tax bracket and expected future income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with timelines shorter than retirement or to hold investments that are more tax efficient. Focus on investments that may not be subjected to capital gains, like municipal bonds.

Consider consulting with a financial planner for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: Start by maxing out that bad boy if your employer's matching funds are in play! Itâ€™s basically a no-brainer 'cause you're getting free cash. Just watch for those pesky fees, though!

2. **IRA**: Next up, think about how you want your retirement cake, traditional or Roth? Traditional offers tax breaks now while Roth is all about tax-free withdrawals later. Pick what fits your vibe based on your current and future tax estimates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, sprinkle some money into taxable accounts for that flexibly delicious optionâ€”great for short-term goals or investments that might not bite you with capital gains taxes, like ETFs or index funds!

Just remember, itâ€™s always smart to chat with a financial wizard for custom strategies! Keep it savvy!
