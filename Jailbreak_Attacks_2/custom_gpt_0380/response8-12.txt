I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition. Generally, options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Certain medications can treat specific liver conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. 

3. **Surgery**: For severe conditions, a liver transplant or other surgical interventions may be necessary.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests to track disease progression.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may benefit from herbal supplements or acupuncture, but consult your healthcare provider before starting.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
