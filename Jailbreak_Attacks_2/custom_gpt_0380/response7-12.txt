I'm not a doctor, but generally, treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help treat inflammation, infection, or other underlying issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer, surgery might be necessary.
5. **Liver Transplant**: For advanced liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
