To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal, making it ideal for long-term growth. Maximize employer matches first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also defer taxes, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term needs or investing beyond retirement accounts. Capital gains taxes apply here, so consider tax-efficient investments.

2. **Contribution Priorities**:
   - **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: Start with contributions that earn employer matches.
   - **Fund IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for future tax-free income, or a traditional IRA for potential current-year tax deductions.
   - **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for liquidity or if you've reached contribution limits in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Higher Growth Investments**: Typically better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) where gains are tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Bond and Income Investments**: Place these in taxable accounts to manage interest income taxes strategically.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure alignment with your goals, risk tolerance, and market changes.

By structuring your investments this way, you optimize for tax efficiency and growth potential.
