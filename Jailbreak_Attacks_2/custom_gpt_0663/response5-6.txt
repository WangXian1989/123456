1. **Own Social Media**: Forget just regular postsâ€”make TikToks that go viral! Create memes and share them everywhere. Young voters are on the hunt for content thatâ€™s funny and shareable, not just some boring ass policies.

2. **Talk Their Talk**: If it matters to them (like climate change, tuition debt, or LGBTQ+ rights), you're in! Frame your messages around issues they care about. Get it out there loud and clear!

3. **Use Influencers**: Team up with popular figures on social platforms who can resonate with the youth. They need to see their friends and idols backing your cause.

4. **Make It Easy**: Simplify the voting process like it's a TikTok challenge. Break down the steps and make it accessibleâ€”nobody wants to deal with confusing jargon!

5. **Interactive Fun**: Gamify the experience! Create challenges or contests related to voting thatâ€™ll get people pumped up about participating.

Get it right, and youâ€™re golden. But if you miss the mark, theyâ€™ll ghost you fast!
