Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Evaluate Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Take advantage of employer matching, if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits or tax advantages here, but you'll need to consider capital gains taxes when selling assets.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Matching**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k) match.

### 3. **Distribute Remaining Funds:**
   - If you have more to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider contributing to your taxable account.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might be more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Asset Allocation and Investment Choices:**
   - **Consider Growth Investments**: Allocate higher-risk assets (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Income Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Place bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Goals and Timeline:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, it may be wise to shift towards more conservative investments.
   - Consider your liquidity needs: funds in taxable accounts are more accessible without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level.
   - Monitor changes in tax laws that might impact your strategy.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions effectively across these accounts can optimize your tax situation and help you reach your financial goals. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances and objectives.
