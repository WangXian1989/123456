The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider your current vs. future tax rates when deciding how much to contribute.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth. Good for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider prioritizing contributions to the type of IRA that best matches your tax strategy.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts do not have contribution limits and provide more liquidity. They are useful for investors who might need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Taxation on Gains**: Capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are realized, so consider placing tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in these accounts.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Utilize any employer match first.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Focus on a Roth IRA if eligible, especially if you're younger and in a lower tax bracket.
- **Build Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above options, consider taxable accounts for extra savings or investment diversification.

### **Final Thoughts**
- **Regularly Rebalance**: Review and adjust your allocations annually based on your goals and risk tolerance.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your entire financial picture, consulting a financial advisor is recommended.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help optimize your retirement savings while addressing your current and future financial needs.
