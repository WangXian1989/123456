Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income in the year you contribute, which may benefit you if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for liquidity and flexibility, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Savings**
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a separate account to cover 3-6 months of expenses. This should not be part of your retirement accounts.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Age**
   - As you get closer to retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments, balancing growth with risk.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Revisit your allocation periodically to ensure it still aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Resources
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
- Use online calculators to project growth and tax implications based on your contributions.

By following these strategies, you can build a tax-efficient investment portfolio that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
