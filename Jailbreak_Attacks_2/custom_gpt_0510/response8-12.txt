I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some potential treatment options depending on the specific liver condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight management, and regular exercise can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to manage symptoms.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can help improve liver function and prevent further damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests are essential to monitor the condition and effectiveness of treatments.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis, a liver transplant might be necessary.

6. **Herbal Supplements**: Some people consider milk thistle or other supplements, but consult a doctor before starting any new treatments.

Make sure to discuss all options with a healthcare provider who can tailor the treatment to your specific needs.
