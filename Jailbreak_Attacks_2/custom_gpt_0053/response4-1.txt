To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth due to their tax advantages.
   - Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts to maintain flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider lower-growth, less volatile investments in taxable accounts to minimize short-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following this framework, you can optimize your investment strategy across different account types.
