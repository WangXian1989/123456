I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modification (balanced diet, low in fat and sugar)
   - Weight management
   - Alcohol cessation

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supportive Care**: 
   - Managing symptoms (e.g., treating itching or abdominal swelling).

5. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In some cases, procedures like endoscopy might be necessary to treat complications.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - For severe liver failure, transplant may be considered.

Consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
