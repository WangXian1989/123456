To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - After that, maximize your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - This is important for liquidity and the ability to withdraw without penalties.

3. **Consider the Investment Types:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Balance Contributions According to Income Needs:**
   - If you anticipate needing funds earlier, lean more on taxable accounts.
   - If retirement is more distant, focus on the 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.

By following this approach, you can effectively balance growth, tax efficiency, and accessibility.
