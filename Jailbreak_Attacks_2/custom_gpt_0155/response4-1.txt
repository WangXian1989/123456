To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer immediate tax benefits.
   - For higher income earners, consider a backdoor Roth IRA if applicable.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.
   - Keep funds for short-term goals in these accounts, as they provide flexibility.

4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments, like stocks, in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for bonds and fixed-income investments, which generate interest taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals will affect your tax bracket, especially in retirement.

Having a strategy tailored to your specific financial situation and goals can greatly enhance your investment growth. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
