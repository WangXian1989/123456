To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to capture the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds and potentially lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Distribute your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are recommended for long-term growth, while bonds are safer but offer lower returns. You may also consider diversifying across various sectors and asset classes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your investments regularly and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, which may shift due to market fluctuations.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, especially if you hold them for less than a year, which may incur higher short-term capital gains taxes.

7. **Review Contributions Annually**: Reassess your contributions and financial situation each year, taking into account any changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you create a comprehensive strategy.

These strategies should help you achieve a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
