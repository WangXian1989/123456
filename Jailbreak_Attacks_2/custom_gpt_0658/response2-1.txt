Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. If you're able, maximize your contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If you've already maximized your 401(k) match and can contribute more, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional IRA and 401(k) are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. However, distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are funded with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess your current and projected future tax brackets to decide which type of account may benefit you more.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, a taxable brokerage account can be an excellent option for flexibility. You can invest in a variety of assets and withdraw funds without penalties (though you will owe capital gains taxes on profits).

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. A common approach is to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as those accounts will benefit most from tax-free growth. Consider more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where capital gains will be taxed.

5. **Regular Review and Adjust**:
   - Revisit your allocations periodically, especially as your financial situation, tax laws, or market conditions change. Adjust contributions or investment strategies as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If you’re unsure about the best approach, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will align with your financial objectives and help optimize your tax situation both now and in retirement.
