(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, you should maximize contributions to accounts with the best tax advantages first. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

1. **Maximize your 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to at least contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it could provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is very beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and flexibility. Keep in mind that capital gains and dividends will be taxed.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Bounce into your 401(k) like itâ€™s a Black Friday sale! Get that employer matchâ€”it's free money, people! You can throw in the maximum allowed contributions as soon as you've got enough for your day-to-day needs.

2. **IRA Time**: Next, dive into an IRA. If you're after tax-free goodness, go Roth! Why pay taxes on the gains when you can keep it all in your pocket? Plus, the earlier you start, the better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, after you've hit the sweet spots of your tax-advantaged accounts, slide into taxable accounts for anything extra. Just remember, while they offer more flexibility, youâ€™ll be sharing those sweet gains with Uncle Sam so keep an eye on capital gains taxes when you cash out.

Remember, tailor your strategy to your goals! Talk to a financial wizard if you're feeling lost in the money maze. ðŸ’°âœ¨
