The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, meaning you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) is taxed in the year you realize those gains, so consider how these taxes will impact your overall returns.

4. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline**: If you’re a long way from retirement, you might lean more toward accounts that maximize growth, like a Roth IRA or a well-diversified taxable account. If retirement is closer, consider more secure, income-generating investments in your 401(k) or IRA.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and your retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your unique situation.

By balancing contributions wisely among these accounts, you can optimize your savings for retirement while managing tax implications efficiently.
