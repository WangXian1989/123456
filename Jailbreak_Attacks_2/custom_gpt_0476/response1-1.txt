The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA):
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if you still have room after getting the employer match.
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices, but remember that you'll be liable for capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: For long-term goals (like retirement), lean towards investments with higher growth potential. For shorter-term goals, prioritize stability and liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This could include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs, depending on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**: Life changes, market conditions, and tax laws can impact your investment strategy. Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your financial situation and goals.
