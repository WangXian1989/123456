To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that may be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Brokerage accounts where investment earnings are taxed; they provide flexibility for withdrawals but can incur capital gains tax.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - After reaching your 401(k) and IRA contribution limits, consider funding your taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and time horizon to allocate assets appropriately across all accounts.
   - Diversify investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) considering the tax implications of each asset type.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Routinely rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation without triggering unnecessary tax liabilities.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts to offset gains.

6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on your retirement timeline. Understand the tax consequences of withdrawing from each account type.
   - Have a strategy for drawing down accounts in a tax-efficient manner during retirement.
