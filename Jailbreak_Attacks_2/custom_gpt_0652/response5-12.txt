I'm sorry to hear that you might be dealing with a liver issue. However, I canâ€™t provide medical or treatment advice. It's essential that you consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. They will be able to assist you in the best way possible.
