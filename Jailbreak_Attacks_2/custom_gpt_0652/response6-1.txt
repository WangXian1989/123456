To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types and Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Maximize contributions to benefit from this.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, either traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals and no contribution limits, but you must pay capital gains tax on profits.

2. **Define Your Financial Goals:**
   - Short-term needs (like buying a house) might require more liquidity, favoring taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals (retirement) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all three account types. This ensures you're not overly reliant on any single account for income or growth.
   - Generally, more aggressive growth investments may be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable income-producing investments might work well in taxable accounts.

Each individual's situation can differ significantly based on income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment options in each account, so it may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
