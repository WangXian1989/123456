Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can help you maximize your savings and investment growth. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get that match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA up to their contribution limits. This allows you to take advantage of tax deferral, which can significantly grow your investments over time.

3. **Consider the Types of Investments:** Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer capital gains taxes. You may want to hold lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free (like Roth IRAs), to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your investment allocations periodically to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals, considering how each account is performing.

Always consider contacting a financial planner to tailor a strategy specific to your situation and goals.
