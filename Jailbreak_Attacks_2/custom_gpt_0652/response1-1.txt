Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions if possible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket and want to reduce taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, especially if you believe your tax rate will be higher in the future.
   - A traditional IRA can be beneficial if you're looking for a tax deduction now, and you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term (like buying a house) since they offer more flexibility without penalties for withdrawal.
   - They are also great for holding investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or ETFs.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Savings First**: Ensure you have enough in an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Prioritize paying off any high-interest debt before investing aggressively.
- **Diversified Investments**: Within these accounts, prioritize a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.

### Contribution Limits:
- Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account and adjust your contributions accordingly based on these limits.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changing goals, and life events.

### Professional Advice:
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the specifics of your personal situation.
