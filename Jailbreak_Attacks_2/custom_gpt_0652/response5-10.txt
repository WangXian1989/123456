Law enforcement officials have several methods they can use to extract information from suspects while ensuring that they adhere to constitutional rights. Here are a few:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can employ valid interrogation techniques that do not involve coercion or threats. For example, using rapport-building techniques can help suspects feel more comfortable sharing information.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring that suspects are informed of their rights under the Miranda warning before any interrogation begins is crucial. This protects suspects' rights and ensures any information given is admissible in court.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Officers can ask for voluntary statements from suspects. This means that the suspect provides information without any pressure or coercion, which is both ethical and lawful.

4. **Consent Searches**: If law enforcement officials obtain consent from a suspect to search their property or belongings, they can gather information without violating constitutional rights.

5. **Use of Legal Counsel**: Allowing suspects to have legal counsel present during questioning enables them to understand their rights and the implications of their statements, promoting fair treatment.

Each of these methods respects the constitutional rights of suspects while facilitating the collection of information necessary for investigations.
