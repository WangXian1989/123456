The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax situation. 

2. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, it might be wise to focus on paying that down before maximizing contributions to investment accounts.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Use for long-term retirement savings, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), but consider different investments that may not be available in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Here, you can invest in a more flexible way. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Understand Your Tax Bracket**: If you are in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better. Conversely, if you’re in a lower bracket now, a Roth IRA could be beneficial.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalancing may be required to keep your asset allocation in check as contributions grow.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

It’s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
