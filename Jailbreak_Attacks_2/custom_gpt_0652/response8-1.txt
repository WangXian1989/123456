The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Account**: 
   - Maximize employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of the match before moving to other accounts.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - If you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high dividends or interest, as these are taxed annually.
   - Consider holding low-turnover investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - Assess your liquidity needs and consider keeping some funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
