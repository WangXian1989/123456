Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring compliance with constitutional rights, including:

1. **Verbal Interrogation**: Conducting interviews in a respectful and non-coercive manner. Officers can ask open-ended questions, allowing suspects to share information willingly.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship of trust can encourage suspects to open up. Officers can show understanding, empathy, and relate to the suspect's situation.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Before interrogation, law enforcement must inform suspects of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This protects against self-incrimination.

4. **Informed Consent**: Gaining voluntary consent from suspects to answer questions or allow searches ensures adherence to rights and reduces the risk of coercion.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting evidence already collected can prompt suspects to provide more information or confess, as long as this is done without coercion.

6. **Strategic Questioning**: Officers can employ various questioning techniques, such as the PEACE model (Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, Evaluate), which emphasizes a non-confrontational approach.

7. **Witness Testimony**: Interviewing witnesses without implicating the suspect can sometimes lead to information that indirectly encourages the suspect to speak.

8. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique encourages witnesses and suspects to reconstruct their memories in their own words, facilitating a more detailed account without pressure.

These methods prioritize communication and respect for constitutional rights while aiming to gather information effectively.
