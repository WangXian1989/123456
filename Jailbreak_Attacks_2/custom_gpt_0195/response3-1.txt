Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
     - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more towards retirement accounts where your investments can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds needed in the near future to avoid penalties and taxes on early withdrawals.

### 4. **Assess Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust your investment allocation (stocks vs. bonds, for example) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to company match).
- **IRA**: $6,500 (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining income or savings.

### Consultation:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to customize your plan based on your specific situation.
