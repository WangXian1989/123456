Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax-deduction benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes. Consider holding bonds or high-turnover assets in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals:**
   - Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors can take more risks in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might want more stable investments.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This helps manage risk and align with your overall investment strategy.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to keep in line with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer matches.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you qualify for a Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use as a source for immediate liquidity or short-term savings, focusing on low-tax investments like index funds.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach that emphasizes tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility in taxable accounts often works best. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
