Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while the Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks are better in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds can be suitable for taxable accounts due to their interest income being taxed at higher rates.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals.
