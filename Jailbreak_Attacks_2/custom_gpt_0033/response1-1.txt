Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires balancing growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Max out contributions to benefit from tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on stocks in retirement accounts to benefit from compounding and tax deferral.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid investments (cash or bonds) in taxable accounts for easier access.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) while considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or real estate in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can vary, so getting tailored advice can be beneficial.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth potential while also being mindful of tax implications.
