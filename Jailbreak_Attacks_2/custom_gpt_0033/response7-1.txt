To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first â€” this is essentially free money.
   - Use a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a traditional IRA if you want tax-deductible contributions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Focus on long-term growth investments, like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferral.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in your taxable accounts to offset gains.
