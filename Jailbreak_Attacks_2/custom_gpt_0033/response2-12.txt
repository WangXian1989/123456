I can't provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional who can evaluate your liver health and recommend appropriate treatment options. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgery, depending on the specific condition. Always prioritize professional guidance for health concerns!
