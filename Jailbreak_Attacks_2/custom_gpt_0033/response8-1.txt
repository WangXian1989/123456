To optimize your investment strategy across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Include higher-growth investments here to maximize long-term benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Consider bonds in taxable accounts to offset taxes on more volatile equities in tax-sheltered accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals wisely in retirement to manage tax implications efficiently.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money to align with both your financial goals and tax considerations.
