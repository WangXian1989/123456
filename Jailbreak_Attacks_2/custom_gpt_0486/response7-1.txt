When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to follow a strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here are some tips to help you make the most of these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the IRS limit) if you have access to an employer match or strong investment options.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA (also up to the maximum limit). The choice between the two depends on your income and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need access to in the short term. Capital gains in taxable accounts may incur taxes, so consider keeping lower-turnover investments in these accounts.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on capital gains.
   - Consider holding fixed-income investments (bonds) in taxable accounts, as their interest income is taxed at ordinary rates.

4. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**: Tailor your contributions based on your financial objectives (retirement, purchasing a home, etc.) and your timeline for those goals. 

5. **Revisit and Adjust Regularly**: Reassess your contributions and investment allocations annually to ensure they align with your current financial situation and goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
