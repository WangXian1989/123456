Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. This is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you believe you’ll be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, whether it’s traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but do not have the same tax advantages.

4. **Investment Selection**:
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds have different growth potential and risk levels.

5. **Consider Fees**:
   - Pay attention to the fees associated with your investment accounts. Lower fees can mean more money compounding over time.

6. **Continually Reassess**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution strategy, especially as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and circumstances.
