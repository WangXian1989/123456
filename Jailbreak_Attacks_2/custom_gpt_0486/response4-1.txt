It's important to recognize that I can't provide personalized financial advice. However, consider these general principles when thinking about how to allocate your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider high-quality, low-cost investment options available within your 401(k).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA (which may provide tax deductions) or a Roth IRA (which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - Max out your contributions if possible, as this can be a powerful retirement savings tool.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for goals with shorter time horizons or for investments that you want to maintain flexibility with. 
   - Opt for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and potential reward.
   - Keep an eye on your overall asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy that meets your specific needs and circumstances.
