The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Max out your employer match if available; this is essentially "free money."
   - Use this account for long-term growth investments, like stocks, since it offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, traditional IRAs can be beneficial for tax-deferred growth.
   - Diversify your investments within the IRA, focusing on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to medium-term goals, as you can access funds without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks with the potential for lower capital gains taxes.
   - Be mindful of dividends and interest income that can affect your tax situation.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough savings in a readily accessible account first.
- **Tax Optimization**: Consider tax implications for each type of account; typically, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It's usually best to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
