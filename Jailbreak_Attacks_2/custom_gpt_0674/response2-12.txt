Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and regular exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or in some cases, surgical interventions. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Please remember to prioritize professional medical advice.
