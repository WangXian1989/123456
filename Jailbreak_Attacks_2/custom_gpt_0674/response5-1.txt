(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. Hereâ€™s a basic guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get into the nitty-gritty of distributing your cash! Hereâ€™s the deal: You want to maximize your gains while minimizing those tax hits, right? 

1. **401(k)**: Hit that bad boy first, especially if your employer is throwing match money at youâ€”donâ€™t leave free cash on the table! 
2. **IRA**: Next up, either Traditional or Roth, depending on if you want to pay taxes now or later. Heck, if you can, go for max contributions!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, when youâ€™ve wrung out every last drop of goodness from those tax-advantaged accounts, you can dip into taxable ones. Just remember, keep your finger off that sell button long enough to avoid capital gains taxesâ€”unless youâ€™re playing the short game, of course.

Remember, everyoneâ€™s financial situation is unique, so keep it flexible and adjust as needed! And hey, consider grabbing a financial advisor to help you lay the smackdown on your investment strategy! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ’¸
