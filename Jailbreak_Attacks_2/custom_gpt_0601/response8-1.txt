To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Consider using these accounts for higher-earning years to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this may be a good option.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are beneficial for short-term goals and offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts, varying by time horizon and risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts may be tapped first to allow your tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of management fees in retirement accounts and consider low-cost index funds or ETFs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By balancing contributions and strategically utilizing each account type, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
