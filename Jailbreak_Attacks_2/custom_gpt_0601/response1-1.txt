Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs have similar tax treatment to 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are generally more flexible but can be taxed differently based on capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing.

4. **Investment Horizon**: Consider your time frame for each account. If you need funds sooner, a taxable account may be better due to early withdrawal penalties on retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your targets.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide invaluable insights.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize your growth and tax efficiency.
