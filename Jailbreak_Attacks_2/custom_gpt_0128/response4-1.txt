To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t maxed out contributions, prioritize this account. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Either traditional or Roth, depending on current tax brackets. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these for investments that don't fit into tax-advantaged accounts, like short-term goals or avoiding penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Equities**: Consider holding equities in tax-advantaged accounts for tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds**: Place lower-growth investments like bonds in taxable accounts to take advantage of the lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Keep your asset distribution aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for which accounts to withdraw from in retirement. Typically, you'll withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged growth to continue longer.

Always ensure you’re considering your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can also offer personalized guidance.
