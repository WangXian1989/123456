Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k), with potential tax deductions depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Account**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year earned, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid form (like a savings account) before heavily investing.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for high-growth investments (stocks) that can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-generating investments (bonds) to manage tax implications effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations across accounts to align with your goals and market changes.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Consider your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and changes in income. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can ensure that your strategy aligns with your overall financial goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
