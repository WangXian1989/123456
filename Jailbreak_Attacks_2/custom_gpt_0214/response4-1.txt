Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (or Roth post-tax), which can lower your taxable income now or provide tax-free growth later.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Treatment**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if age 50+).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow easier access to funds without penalties, ideal for short-term needs.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for less than a year versus long-term holdings.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) to match any employer contributions.
- **Maximize your IRA contributions** next, particularly if you can benefit from tax-free growth.
- **Allocate remaining funds** to your taxable account for flexibility and to meet any short-term savings goals.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your allocations annually to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and investment performance.
