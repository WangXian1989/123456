Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider maxing out Roth contributions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Ensure that your overall asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and goals.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement without penalties. Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize your tax benefits.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions, prioritizing a Roth if eligible.
- **Taxable accounts:** Invest additional savings here, focusing on long-term growth.

### Review and Adjust
- Regularly review your allocations based on performance and life changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your particular situation.
