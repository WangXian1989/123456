Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now; ideal for high earners.
   - **IRA**: Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility but subject to capital gains tax. Use for short-term goals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies before fully funding retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Horizons**:
   - **Long-term (retirement)**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term**: Use taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes. Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
