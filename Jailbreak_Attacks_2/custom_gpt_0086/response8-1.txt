Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; distributions are taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow the same tax structure as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year itâ€™s earned, which can include capital gains, dividends, and interest.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**:
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
   - Use taxable accounts for more immediate needs or investments with shorter horizons.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to balance risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals.
