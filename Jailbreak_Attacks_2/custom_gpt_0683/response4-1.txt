The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if you can, as contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider if you want to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Depending on your income, you may receive tax benefits from a traditional IRA; if you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA could be more beneficial in the long run.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age, as withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs may incur penalties.
   - Taxable accounts also benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates being lower than ordinary income tax rates, so they can be a tax-efficient way to hold investments.

4. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance. More aggressive investments may go in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and other assets, according to your overall investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you'll withdraw funds from each account during retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications upon withdrawal.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and retirement plans.

It's a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your personal situation.
