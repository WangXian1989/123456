When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions (especially if you reach the match limit), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment choices and fees associated with each account. If your 401(k) has high fees, it might make sense to prioritize the IRA or taxable accounts.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**:
   - Decide whether a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA suits your tax situation better. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now but require taxes on withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are well-diversified between stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account. This helps to manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before putting too much into retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributions from tax-advantaged accounts are generally taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed differently. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, it might make sense to prioritize Roth options or taxable accounts for flexibility.

7. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term financial goals, whether thatâ€™s retirement, buying a home, or other investments.

8. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, and shifts in your financial goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
