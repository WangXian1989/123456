Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize any employer match if available, as this is essentially free money. Contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts.
   - Consider the tax advantages of a traditional 401(k) (pre-tax contributions) versus a Roth 401(k) (after-tax contributions). A traditional 401(k) might be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous.
   - The IRA has limits that can be beneficial for tax strategy, especially if you're already maxing out your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. They offer flexibility with withdrawals and a broader range of investment options, but earnings might be subject to capital gains taxes.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities in taxable accounts.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions based on employer matches, high-interest debt repayment, and emergency savings.
- Build a diversified investment portfolio across all account types, keeping in mind the tax implications of each.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
