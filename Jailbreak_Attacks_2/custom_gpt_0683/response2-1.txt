When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. Consider maximizing employer match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limits are typically $23,000 for 401(k)s (including catch-up contributions) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - 401(k) plans usually have limited investment options. If you have better choices in an IRA or taxable account, you might prioritize those.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexible withdrawal options without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of account type.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Consider your timeline, whether you're saving for retirement or a short-term goal, which can influence how you allocate your investments.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions to take advantage of employer matching.
- **Contribute to an IRA**, prioritizing the type based on your tax situation.
- **Invest in taxable accounts** for additional funds once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient.
