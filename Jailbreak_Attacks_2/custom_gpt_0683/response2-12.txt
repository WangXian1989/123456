I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid alcohol and high-sugar or fatty foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), different medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or fight infection.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and detect any progression of liver disease.

4. **Avoid Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to harmful substances, including alcohol, certain medications, and chemicals.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, surgical options, including liver transplant, may be considered.

Always speak to your healthcare provider for personalized medical advice tailored to your situation.
