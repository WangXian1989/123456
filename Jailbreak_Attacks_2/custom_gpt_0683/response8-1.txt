Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on maxing out contributions to these accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth. For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (under age 50) and $6,500 for IRAs.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k). These allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Investments**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is where you can manage taxes on capital gains, which may be advantageous if you hold investments long-term.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon, maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. More aggressive choices may be appropriate in your 401(k) and IRA, given their long-term nature.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you'll withdraw funds. Different accounts have different tax implications on withdrawals, so plan accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.
