To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; higher contribution limits; employer match is valuable.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Tax advantages (traditional tax-deferred, Roth tax-free on withdrawals); lower contribution limits compared to 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; offers flexibility and easier access to funds.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before allocating more funds elsewhere.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**:
     - Place bonds and high-dividend income generators in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
     - Keep growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on market conditions and personal goals. 

### 3. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - **Prioritize Contributions**:
     - Start with the maximum allowable contribution to the 401(k) to leverage any employer match.
     - Next, fund an IRA, focusing on maximizing tax benefits, especially if eligible for a Roth.
     - Finally, allocate any excess funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Withdrawal Planning**:
   - Consider your timeline and when you'll need access to funds. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts strategically leverages tax advantages while optimizing for growth. Regularly review your portfolio to ensure allocations align with your financial goals and market conditions.
