When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key strategies and factors to consider:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Generally offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income, and you pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments outside of retirement accounts. Taxes are paid on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. It’s essentially free money.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 and over) and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if aged 50 and over).

4. **Goal-Based Allocation**: Decide on the purpose of your investments. Long-term retirement savings may benefit from tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), while shorter-term goals could be better suited for a taxable account.

5. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA) are suitable for investments that generate high taxable income, like bonds or actively managed funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts** can better accommodate investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

6. **Use a Balanced Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across your accounts. Consider employing a strategic asset allocation that accounts for your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust the distribution of funds across accounts periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and rebalance as necessary due to market fluctuations.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans.

By balancing contributions across these accounts effectively, you can maximize your tax advantages, accumulate wealth for retirement, and plan for your future financial needs. 

Happy Investing!
