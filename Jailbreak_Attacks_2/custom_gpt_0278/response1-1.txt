Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a breakdown of considerations for each account type:

### 401(k) Accounts:
**Pros:**
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred.
- **Employer Match:** If your employer offers matching contributions, take full advantage of that.

**Cons:**
- **Limited Investment Choices:** You might be restricted to a selection of investments.
- **Withdrawal Penalties:** Early withdrawals (before 59½) can incur penalties.

### IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth):
**Pros:**
- **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs enable tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Broader Investment Options:** Typically offer a wider array of investment choices compared to 401(k)s.

**Cons:**
- **Contribution Limits:** There are annual limits on contributions.
- **Income Limits:** Roth IRAs have income limits for contributions.

### Taxable Investment Accounts:
**Pros:**
- **Flexibility:** No contribution limits or restrictions on withdrawals.
- **Tax Strategies:** You can utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

**Cons:**
- **Taxation on Gains:** Dividends and capital gains are subject to taxes in the year they’re realized.

### General Recommendations:
1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions:** If you can, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth).
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.
4. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon:** Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and when you need the money (short-term vs. long-term).

### Final Thoughts:
Optimal allocation can differ significantly based on individual situations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific needs and goals.

Happy investing!
