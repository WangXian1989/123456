When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. Taxes will be owed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually, making them less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be better suited for long-term growth, while bonds might be more appropriate for short-term stability.

### 4. **Emergency Fund First:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before contributing heavily to investments. Typically, this should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Prioritize Savings:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 6. **Balancing Contributions:**
   - Once you have contributed to your retirement accounts, allocate any extra savings to your taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get full employer match (up to 5-10% of income).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently $6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds after utilizing tax-advantaged accounts.

Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
