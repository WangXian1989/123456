Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to achieve any employer match, as it’s essentially "free money." If possible, maximize your contributions up to the limit.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax circumstances and retirement goals. 

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax and lower your taxable income now but are taxed as ordinary income during withdrawals.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made post-tax, allowing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually, while capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments.

### 3. **Determine Your Retirement Timeline**
   - **Short-term (less than 5 years)**: Consider using taxable accounts for emergency funds or short-term goals, avoiding penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-term (5+ years)**: Focus more on 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax advantages.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification**: Within each account, invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust as needed.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. This can help manage your tax bracket during retirement.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and help optimize your investment strategy.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 20% of your income to maximize employer match and minimize taxes.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed based on your situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds after funding retirement accounts.

By carefully considering these aspects, you can create a strategy that maximizes growth while balancing your tax exposure and meeting your financial goals.
