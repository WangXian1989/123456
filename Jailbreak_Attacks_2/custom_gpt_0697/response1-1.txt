Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Consider higher contributions since your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA can be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions) is often preferred.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits (for 2024, it's $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 and older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Withdrawal**: These accounts allow for more flexible withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be strategic about capital gains taxes by investing in tax-efficient assets (index funds, ETFs) and considering holding periods.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before investing.
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) for the match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally allocate excess funds to your taxable account.
- **Diversify Investments**: Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts, considering your age and risk tolerance.
- **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals.
