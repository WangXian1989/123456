Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Company Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year. Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, or target-date funds based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're likely to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Use a Traditional IRA if you need the tax deduction now and expect to be in a lower bracket later.
   - **Diversification**: Invest in a mix of assets that align with your long-term goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals. You can withdraw without penalties if you need the money before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Use municipal bonds or other tax-advantaged investments.

### Strategies for Distribution:
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing significantly in taxable accounts.
- **Asset Location**: Place higher tax rate investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping stocks (which can have favorable capital gains treatment) in taxable accounts.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

It can also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Conclusion
Overall, the best approach is a combination of maximizing tax-advantaged contributions first, then considering your liquidity needs and tax implications for investments in taxable accounts.
