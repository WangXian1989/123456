To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred. Consider maximizing employer match if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received, and capital gains are taxed upon sale.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you're age 50 or older), while traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Assess when you might need access to funds. Taxable accounts provide the most flexibility, while retirement accounts have restrictions and penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Consider the types of investments optimal for each account:
     - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Ideal for higher growth investments that are taxed at capital gains rates in taxable accounts.
     - **Taxable accounts**: Favor investments that generate qualified dividends and lower turnover to minimize tax impact.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the funds.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) contributions** to take full advantage of employer matching.
- **Fund your IRA** next, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribute to a taxable account** if you have additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Example Allocation:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match (e.g., 6% if there's a match).
- Consider funding your IRA up to the maximum limit.
- Use any leftover funds for your taxable account, focusing on investments that have favorable tax treatment.

Adjust your strategy based on your individual goals, financial situation, and any changes to tax laws. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
