Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for optimizing growth while considering tax implications. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can offer tax advantages and further diversify your retirement savings.

3. **401(k) Contributions After IRA**: Once you've maxed out the employer match in your 401(k) and contributed to your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement age, or for short-term goals. Investments in taxable accounts can also be strategically placed for tax efficiency.

5. **Investment Type Consideration**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or stocks) in your taxable account.

6. **Review Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.

Remember that everyone's financial situation is unique, so what works best will depend on your personal goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance.
