Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts that provide the biggest tax benefit. For high earners, traditional IRA contributions may be limited, making Roth IRA contributions more appealing.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on broad market index funds or target-date funds for growth, depending on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for investments that may generate high taxes if held in a taxable account (like REITs or bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize low-turnover index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how to withdraw funds strategically in retirement to minimize taxes:
     - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
     - Use your 401(k) and IRAs later, considering your tax bracket each year.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### Summary
1. Max out 401(k) to get the match.
2. Contribute to IRAs based on tax benefits.
3. Use taxable accounts for long-term investments with low tax implications.
4. Plan withdrawals to minimize taxes.
