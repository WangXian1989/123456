I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Follow a balanced diet.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Diuretics for fluid retention.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular liver function tests.
   - Imaging studies to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be an option.

Consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
