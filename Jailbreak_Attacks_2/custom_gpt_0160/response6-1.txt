Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some effective strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments generating lower taxes, like long-term capital gains.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on high-growth investments here to maximize tax advantages.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to spread risk.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to align with your changing goals and market conditions.

### 5. **Account Types Matter:**
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

By implementing these strategies, you can optimize your wealth over time.
