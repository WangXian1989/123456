Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider these factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions; grow tax-deferred but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits; traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Retirement savings should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) (up to $22,500 for 2023).
   - Contribute to an IRA (limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50) after 401(k) max.

4. **Employer Match**:
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Balance risk across accounts, ensuring a mix of stocks and bonds suitable for your risk tolerance.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max out the 401(k)** to get any employer matching contributions.
2. **Contribute to IRAs** next, focusing on Roth if youâ€™re eligible for tax-free growth.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment options.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
