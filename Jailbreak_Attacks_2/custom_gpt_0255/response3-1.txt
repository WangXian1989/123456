Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):**
     - Ideal for investments expected to grow significantly.
     - Lower your taxable income now and defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds).
     - Favor long-term capital gains by holding investments for over a year.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions if you're in a high tax bracket to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Consider if you’re eligible for traditional or Roth. Roth IRAs grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Good for flexibility in withdrawals and no penalties.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account separate from these investments.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like ETFs or index funds).
   - Consider your risk tolerance and adjust asset allocation accordingly.

### Summary
Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to get the match, then consider maxing out IRAs based on your tax situation, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and immediate needs.

### Adjust as Necessary
Regularly review and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or retirement goals.
