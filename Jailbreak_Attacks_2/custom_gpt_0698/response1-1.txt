When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer matches contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Investment Options**: Typically limited to the options provided by your employer. Evaluate the investment choices to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Accounts)**:
   - **Types**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older for 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide the flexibility to access your funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on investments held less than a year. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - **Diversity**: Use this account for goals that are shorter-term or more flexible, or for investments that may not be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., certain bonds).

### Distribution Strategy:

1. **Prioritize Account Types**:
   - Start with employer-sponsored accounts (like your 401(k)) to take advantage of matching contributions.
   - Next, consider maxing out an IRA for its tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in your taxable accounts (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize tax liability.

3. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Assess your allocations regularly to adjust for changes in your financial goals, risk tolerance, or market conditions.

Working with a financial advisor can also help to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation.
