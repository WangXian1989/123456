1. **Dietary Changes:**
   - Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats, sugar, and salt.

   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C).
   - Corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.
   - Avoid substances that can worsen liver damage, like alcohol and certain medications.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**

5. **Surgical Options:**
