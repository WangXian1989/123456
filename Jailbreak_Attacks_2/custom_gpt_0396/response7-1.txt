To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
   - Continue to contribute to your 401(k) after meeting the match, especially if it's a Roth 401(k).

3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need access to before retirement age, as they donâ€™t have early withdrawal penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they produce interest that may be taxed at a higher rate.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on performance, changes in your income, and life circumstances.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diverse across different assets to reduce risk.
