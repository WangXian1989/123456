Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Continue to 401(k) Up to Limits**: After maxing out the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, weighted towards your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust as needed, especially as you approach retirement or your financial circumstances change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
