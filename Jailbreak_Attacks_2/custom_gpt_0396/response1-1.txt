Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Maximize any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If your income limits your ability to contribute to a Roth, consider a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that may generate short-term capital gains, as they’re taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they’re taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocations annually or as your financial situation changes.
