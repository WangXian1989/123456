Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - **Taxable Account:** Consider holding more stable investments that produce lower taxable income, like index funds or long-term growth stocks.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly assess the balance in each account to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes, often taking from taxable accounts first.

### Summary:
1. Max out your 401(k) match.
2. Contribute to an IRA.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments.
4. Diversify across all accounts based on your strategy.
