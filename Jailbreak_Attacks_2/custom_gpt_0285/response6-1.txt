To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) but with contribution limits and potential income phase-outs for tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year they're realized, offering less favorable tax treatment.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA and 401(k) annually.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments that may require liquidity.

3. **Reevaluate Investment Strategy**:
   - **Place Higher-Risk Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Such as stocks in your 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Hold Lower-Risk or Income Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks, where managing tax impacts is essential.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - **Annual Reviews**: Assess your investment performance, your contribution levels, and make adjustments based on changes in tax law, market conditions, and personal financial situations.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-balanced financial strategy that maximizes growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
