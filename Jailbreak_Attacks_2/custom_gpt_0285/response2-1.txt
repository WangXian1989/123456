The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your investment growth. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to these accounts.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (generally 3-6 months' worth of living expenses) in a liquid, easily accessible account.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your investment strategy and asset allocation. Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, you might want to diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all your accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your expected tax bracket at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for more flexible access to funds, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Consider your long-term financial goals. If you plan to use funds for a specific purpose (like buying a house), you may allocate funds towards a taxable account for more immediate access.

7. **Re-assess Regularly**: Periodically review your investment strategy and asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances.
