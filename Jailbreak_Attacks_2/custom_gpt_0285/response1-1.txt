The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Employer 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize IRAs**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA which offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for flexibility. Theyâ€™re great for saving for shorter-term goals and provide access to your money without penalties (unlike retirement accounts). Consider holding tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each investment account type. Interest income is typically taxed at ordinary income rates in taxable accounts, while long-term capital gains and qualified dividends may be taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation may change, so review and adjust your allocations as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
