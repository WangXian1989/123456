1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying cause, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or target specific liver diseases (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and imaging tests to assess liver health.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe liver damage or tumors, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.
5. **Supportive Care**: This can include managing complications and providing symptomatic relief.
