Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out your IRA**: If you qualify, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that can generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: If you need access to cash in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts since they provide more flexibility.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced allocation across account types to minimize risk and optimize growth over time.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider speaking with a financial planner. 

This approach balances tax efficiency with your overall investment strategy.
