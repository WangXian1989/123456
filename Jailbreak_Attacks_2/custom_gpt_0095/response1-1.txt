Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you can, maximize contributions, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These give you flexibility in withdrawals without penalties, but they may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're saving for long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, consider holding funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Review Your Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts. Different accounts can hold different types of investments (like stocks in Roth IRAs for tax-free growth and bonds in taxable accounts for tax efficiency).

6. **Annual Review**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.
