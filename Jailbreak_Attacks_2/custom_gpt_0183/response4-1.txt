Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing the maximum allowed, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as withdrawals will be tax-free in retirement.

2. **Expense Ratios and Investment Options**:
   - Compare the investment choices and fees in your 401(k) with those of your IRA. If your 401(k) has high fees, you might want to prioritize your IRA.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: If all retirement accounts are maxed out, invest in a taxable account. Use tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs.
   - Keep in mind that capital gains tax rates on long-term investments are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Reassess Annually**: Review and adjust your distributions based on performance, changes in income, and evolving financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
