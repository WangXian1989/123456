When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors must come into play, such as your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here's a basic framework for effective distribution:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income now but taxing withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so it can be beneficial for funds you might need before retirement. 

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities based on your risk tolerance. Generally, consider higher risk assets in tax-deferred accounts for growth due to their compounding benefits.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your investment goals.

### Final Considerations
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside of these accounts for immediate needs.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Align distributions with your anticipated retirement age and lifestyle expectations.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
