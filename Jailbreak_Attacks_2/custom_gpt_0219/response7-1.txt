The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) (especially if your employer offers a matching contribution) and IRA. The tax advantages of these accounts can help your savings grow faster.

2. **IRA vs. taxable accounts**: If you have the option to choose between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, consider your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement. A Roth IRA lets your money grow tax-free, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Diversify investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Stocks typically offer higher growth potential, while bonds are generally safer.

4. **Consider tax implications**: Investments that produce income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, whereas stocks with high growth potential can be effectively held in taxable accounts where they may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalance periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
