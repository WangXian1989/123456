Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Great for maximizing employer benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, but you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible; tax-free withdrawals in retirement can be invaluable.
   - **Max Out 401(k):** After securing your match and funding an IRA, aim to max out your 401(k) contributions if possible.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:** Reserve these for funding goals that are shorter-term or for investments that may generate capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth investments (like bonds) that may generate less immediate tax liability.

### 4. **Adjust for Your Situation:**
   - **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger investors might lean towards riskier assets, while those closer to retirement may prioritize less risky investments.
   - **Income Level:** Higher income earners could benefit more from tax-deferred accounts to lower taxable income.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Check your asset allocation and contributions annually to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical):
- **401(k):** 50% of contributions
- **IRA:** 30% of contributions
- **Taxable Account:** 20% of contributions

## Final Note:
Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your personal situation and goals.
