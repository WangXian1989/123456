To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Next, max out your IRA if you're eligible.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for tax-advantaged investments (e.g., bonds or REITs).
   - Consider putting stocks in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your time horizon and risk tolerance. For longer-term goals, you might lean more towards stocks. For shorter-term needs, more conservative investments may be warranted.

4. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your asset allocation yearly to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions. 

5. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Be aware of the tax implications and penalties for withdrawing funds from retirement accounts before retirement age.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax liabilities.
