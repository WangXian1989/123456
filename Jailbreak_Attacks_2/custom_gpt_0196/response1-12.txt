I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Generally, treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition.
3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups to track liver health.
4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, such as liver transplant.

Please see a doctor for personalized advice!
