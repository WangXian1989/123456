When deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribution Level**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Evaluate the investment options within your 401(k) and choose a diversified portfolio.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA to enhance your tax benefits.
     - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversify Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Types**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains tax.
   - **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds from these accounts, which can affect your tax burden in retirement.

### 4. **General Allocation Strategy**
   - **Aggressive Growth**: If you're younger, consider a higher allocation to stocks in your 401(k) and IRA, and use taxable accounts for more conservative investments.
   - **Conservative Approach**: As you approach retirement, shift towards bonds and other lower-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping some growth potential in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**
   - **Annual Reassessment**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust your contributions based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Creating a balanced approach across these accounts can optimize your returns while minimizing tax liabilities. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
