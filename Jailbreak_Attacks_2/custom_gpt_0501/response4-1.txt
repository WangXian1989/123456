To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out your employer's match first.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you’ll have different tax implications. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed annually, so they’re typically better for funds you may need to access before retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment allocations with your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account. For instance, you might hold more aggressive investments in retirement accounts and more stable assets in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Understand the withdrawal rules and penalties associated with each account type. This knowledge can help you strategize distributions during retirement.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure diversified asset allocation across all accounts to mitigate risk. 
   - Consider using different investment vehicles (like ETFs, stocks, bonds) based on the account type and your investment strategy.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure that you’re on track with your goals and that your allocations reflect market changes.
