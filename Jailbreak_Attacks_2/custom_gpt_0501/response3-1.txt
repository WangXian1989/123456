To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching. Contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement investment accounts where you pay taxes on earnings. Suitable for short-term goals or as a complement to retirement savings.

### 2. **Determine Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to any employer match in your 401(k) first, as it's essentially "free money."
   - For 2024, the contribution limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up).

### 3. **Prioritize Based on Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Use this for tax-deferred growth. Consider if you want a traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax) option.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free withdrawals later; otherwise, balance with a Traditional IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that can provide flexibility and liquidity. Prioritize investments that generate long-term capital gains (lower tax rates) or tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary, especially if the markets change your original allocations.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
| Account Type     | Suggested Percentage of Total Savings |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 401(k)           | 30-50%                               |
| IRA              | 20-30%                               |
| Taxable Account   | 20-30%                               |
| Emergency Fund    | 3-6 months of expenses (separate, if applicable)  |

### 6. **Consider Financial Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Tailor your distribution based on specific financial goals (e.g., retirement age, purchasing a home) and your time horizon.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your entire financial picture, including expenses, debts, and goals, before deciding on your distribution strategy. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance can also be beneficial.
