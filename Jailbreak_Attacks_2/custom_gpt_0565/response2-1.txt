To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money".
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or municipal bonds. You can also hold assets for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - Place higher-yield investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on the income they generate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors regardless of the account type. This reduces risk.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Consider your cash flow and liquidity needs. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility if you need to access your money before retirement.

5. **Retirement Age**:
   - If you are closer to retirement, consider shifting assets into safer investments within your 401(k) and IRA, while potentially using taxable accounts for more aggressive growth.

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation based on changes in your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

A balanced approach tailored to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance will help you make the most of your investments across these accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
