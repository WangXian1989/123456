I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol. Medication may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. In more severe cases, treatments like liver transplant might be considered. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
