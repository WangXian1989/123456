(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, a balanced approach can be beneficial:

1. **401(k)** - Prioritize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Maximize this to take full advantage of any potential free money.
2. **IRA** - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.
3. **Taxable Accounts** - Use these for savings goals that are short-term or medium-term. They can also be a good place to hold investments that provide qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for tax efficiency.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific needs.
