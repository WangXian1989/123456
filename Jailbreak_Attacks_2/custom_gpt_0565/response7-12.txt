I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's really important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation. They may recommend treatments such as lifestyle changes (dietary adjustments, exercise), medications, or in more severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation. Please make sure you speak with a doctor for the best course of action tailored to your needs.
