Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits and Benefits:**

- **401(k):** Maximize contributions up to the employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
  
- **IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA if you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k). The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

- **Taxable Accounts:** Any money after maxing out retirement accounts can go into taxable accounts for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**

- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions reduce taxable income now. Investments grow tax-free until withdrawal, which is taxed as ordinary income.

- **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here generate taxable events (capital gains, dividends). Consider holding investments that you plan to keep long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Timeline and Goals:**

- For **long-term goals**, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
- For **short-term liquidity needs**, focus more on taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**

- Use the accounts based on their tax treatment. For example:
  - Hold **high-growth stocks** in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
  - Use **bond funds** in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxes on interest income.

### Suggested Distribution Example:

1. **Max out 401(k) contributions (up to employer match).**
2. **Contribute to an IRA if eligible.**
3. **Diversify remaining funds in taxable accounts, focusing on a mix of stocks and bonds, maximizing tax efficiency.**

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**

Make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Rebalancing ensures your portfolio remains aligned with your investment goals.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will be tailored to your individual financial situation, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
