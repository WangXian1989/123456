Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help you strategize:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits. Good for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs are tax-free on withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No contribution limits and flexibility with withdrawals, but capital gains taxes will apply.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in the 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Consider Tax Benefits:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you expect lower income during retirement.
   - **401(k) and IRA Limits:** Once you’ve maxed out contributions for your 401(k) and IRA (including catch-up contributions if applicable), focus on your taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Vs. Taxable Investments:** Hold investments that generate high ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine whether you’re saving for short-term goals (which might benefit from a taxable account), medium-term (traditional or Roth IRA), or long-term retirement (401(k) or traditional IRA).

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and account contributions. Adjust as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and your changing risk tolerance or financial goals.

### Example Strategy:
1. Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Next, max out your IRA contributions (considering whether a Roth or Traditional IRA is better suited for you).
3. Allocate any additional funds to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.
4. Finally, direct surplus income into a taxable account to provide flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation, as they can provide detailed guidance on the most tax-efficient strategies and help you navigate the complexities of each account type.
