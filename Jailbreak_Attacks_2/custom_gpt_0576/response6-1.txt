Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, and long-term goals. Here are some strategies to optimize your allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Determine Your Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with the most tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more funds to taxable accounts for liquidity, as these can be accessed without penalties before retirement age.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Great for reducing taxable income now, but be mindful of taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and income are taxed annually. Consider investing in tax-efficient vehicles (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize this impact.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts, keeping in mind that tax-advantaged accounts can accommodate a more aggressive allocation, given their long-term horizon.

### Examples:
- **Aggressive Strategy**: Maximize 401(k) contributions first, then IRA, and use taxable accounts for emergency savings or short-term goals.
- **Balanced Approach**: Allocate a portion to all threeâ€”401(k) for long-term growth, IRA for additional retirement savings, and taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Final Tip:
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and life stages to keep your strategy aligned with your goals.
