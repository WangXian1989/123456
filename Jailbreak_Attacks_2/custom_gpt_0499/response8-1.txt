To optimize the distribution of money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
     - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - If your income allows, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - If you contribute to a Traditional IRA, you may get a tax deduction, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals later.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Since these accounts have tax advantages, you might want to hold higher-growth investments here, such as stocks, as the growth will be tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of Roths).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize this account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than regular income. Consider holding bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, you can optimize withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Utilize 401(k) and IRA funds carefully, considering taxes, to minimize the overall tax burden in retirement.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or a short-term investment account separate from your retirement accounts.

5. **Continuous Evaluation**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on your financial goals, market changes, and tax laws.
   - Adjust as necessary to ensure you are maximizing growth and tax efficiency.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions and carefully considering the types of investments within each account, you can achieve optimal growth while minimizing your tax burden.
