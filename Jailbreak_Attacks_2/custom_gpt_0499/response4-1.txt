To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are usually pre-tax, lowering taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Tax-advantaged account for retirement savings. Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that don’t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially “free money” and should be prioritized.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments that will appreciate, as taxes on gains can be deferred until withdrawal (in the case of traditional accounts).
   - For investments in taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - If you can, maximize contributions to both your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, consider the contribution limits:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older).
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).
   - Once you reach these limits, consider investing in taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep your risk tolerance and investment timeline in mind when selecting asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (such as stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, tax-deferred accounts second, and tax-free accounts last to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, changes in income, or life events. Consider the impact of taxes on your overall investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions among these accounts, considering tax effects, and maintaining a diversified investment strategy, you can effectively distribute your money for long-term growth and stability.
