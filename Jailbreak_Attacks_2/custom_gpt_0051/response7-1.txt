Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for optimizing tax benefits and retirement savings. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatments**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Good for high-income earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexible access to funds.

3. **Diversification**: Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

4. **Invest for Growth**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for growth-oriented investments since they benefit most from tax-deferred growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider conservative investments or tax-efficient funds.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial goals or market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy from a professional can ensure that youâ€™re making optimal decisions based on your unique situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your income (to max the employer match)
- **IRA**: Contribute $6,500 if eligible ($7,500 if 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds can be distributed here based on liquidity needs.

This approach balances maximizing tax advantages with maintaining flexibility for your financial goals.
