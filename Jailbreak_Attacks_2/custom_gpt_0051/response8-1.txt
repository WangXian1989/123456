To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, a traditional IRA may be better.
  
3. **Investment Choices**: 
   - Hold higher-risk, higher-return investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable, income-producing investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Account Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider tax implications for withdrawals in retirement, aiming to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of fees in your 401(k) plan; opt for low-cost index funds if available.

### General Guidelines:
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
- Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific goals and situation.
