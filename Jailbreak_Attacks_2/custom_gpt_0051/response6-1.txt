To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**

- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first, as it's essentially free money. If possible, maximize contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**

- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks to benefit from tax deferral.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, prioritizing tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**

- Plan withdrawal from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. This can help manage your tax bracket effectively.

### 4. **Rebalancing**

- Regularly review and adjust your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account the different tax implications of each account type.

### 5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**

- Pay attention to fees associated with each type of account. Low-cost index funds can enhance overall returns.

By balancing growth potential with tax efficiency, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
