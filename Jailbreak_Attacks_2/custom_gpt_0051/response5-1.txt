To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to qualify for any employer match. Prioritize maxing out contributions if you're nearing retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if eligible, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Allocate investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk. Use ETFs or index funds for broad market exposure.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your investment performance and strategy, adjusting contributions as needed based on your goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation.
