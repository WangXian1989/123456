Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some key considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Invest for Growth**: If you're young, consider a heavy allocation to stocks.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may lower your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Consider bonds or a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Ideal for funds you might need in the next few years.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses set aside before heavily investing.
- **Max Out 401(k)**: Aim for the maximum contribution to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Maximize contributions, especially if eligible for Roth options.
- **Allocate Extra Funds to Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Regular Review:
- Revisit and adjust your allocations regularly based on changes in income, goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
