(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's beneficial to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first. You may want to consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contribution, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can choose between a Traditional and Roth IRA based on your projected tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investing once you have maximized contributions to the tax-advantaged accounts. These can be helpful for liquidity, as you can withdraw funds without penalty.

Additionally, consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific situation.
