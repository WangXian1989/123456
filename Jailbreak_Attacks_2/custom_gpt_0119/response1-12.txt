I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver problem you're facing, such as lifestyle changes, medication, or potentially more advanced interventions. Always seek guidance from a qualified medical expert to ensure the best care for your condition.
