Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with tax-deferred growth. Often has contribution limits and may include employer matching.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts also provide tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but more flexible for withdrawals. Capital gains taxes apply on investments sold for a profit.

### 2. Optimize Contributions
- **Max out your employer match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
- **Consider tax efficiency**:
  - **Place tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
  - **Hold tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Allocation Strategy
- **Risk Tolerance and Timeline**: Allocate more to higher-risk investments (like stocks) in accounts with a longer-term horizon (like a 401(k) or IRA).
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash).

### 4. Periodic Review
- Regularly assess and adjust contributions based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### Suggested Allocation Example
- **401(k)**: 50% (maximize employer match and aggressive growth)
- **IRA**: 30% (diversified investments)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (for more liquid and flexible assets)

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Implications**: Understand how withdrawals and capital gains will affect your tax situation.
- **Contribution Limits**: Stay aware of the annual limits for each account type.
