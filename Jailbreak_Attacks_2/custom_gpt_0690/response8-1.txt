Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer matches contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Consider if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions.

3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use these for goals with shorter time horizons.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term rates.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before investing heavily.
2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with the employer match in your 401(k).
   - Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
   - Max out your 401(k) if possible.
   - Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility.

3. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distributions annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Horizon**: Longer-term investments are generally best in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax Bracket**: Your current and anticipated future tax brackets can influence whether to favor pre-tax or post-tax contributions.
- **Financial Goals**: Align your investments with your short-term and long-term financial goals.
