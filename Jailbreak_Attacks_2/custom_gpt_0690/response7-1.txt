Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing returns and managing tax implications. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Generally, you should contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, max out contributions (the limit is $22,500 for 2024, with an extra $7,500 for those over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. If eligible, maximize contributions (the limit is $6,500 for 2024, plus $1,000 for those over 50).

### 2. **Assess Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds. Avoid high-fee options, as fees can eat into your returns.
   - **IRA & Taxable Accounts:** In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds. In IRAs, you can take more tax risk with higher-growth investments.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors. This helps mitigate risk.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, so withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA:** Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free, while Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as income. 
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply here when selling investments, so be mindful of when you sell.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to align with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired level of risk.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

### Conclusion
A strategy of maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining a balance in taxable accounts will generally provide the best fiscal outcome. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance that takes into account your specific circumstances.
