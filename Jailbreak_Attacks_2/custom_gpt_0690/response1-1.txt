The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Since contributions are often tax-deferred, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Investment Choices**: Assess the investment options within your 401(k) and choose a mix that aligns with your risk tolerance. Typically, a diversified portfolio that includes stocks, bonds, and possibly index funds is recommended.

### 2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is more beneficial based on your current and expected future tax situation.
     - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
     - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits and aim to maximize contributions if possible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be strategic about investments in taxable accounts. Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider placing high-yield investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and lower-yield investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund for unexpected expenses.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across various asset classes to mitigate risk.
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

### Conclusion:
Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your individual situation. They can help with specific asset allocation strategies and tax implications suitable for your needs.
