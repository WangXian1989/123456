Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Types of Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages, with traditional IRAs being tax-deferred and Roth IRAs providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment options with no tax advantages but can be accessed anytime without penalties.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get your employer match if available.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA which allows for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Put assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for assets with lower tax implications (like long-term capital gains), since these are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Balance your investments according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks may be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Consider when you plan to access these funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed anytime, while retirement accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 6. **Regular Reassessment**:
   - Periodically review your allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, or financial goals.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get full employer matching (if applicable).
2. Max out your IRA contributions.
3. Invest additional funds in a taxable account, prioritizing tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, it may be helpful to consult a financial advisor to align your investment strategy closely with your long-term financial goals.
