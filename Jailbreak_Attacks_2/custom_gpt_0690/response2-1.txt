When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment for tax efficiency and growth potential:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if it offers a good selection of investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k), contribute to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Choose a **Traditional IRA** if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; choose a **Roth IRA** if you anticipate your tax bracket will be higher.

3. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or municipal bonds. Consider holding investments with long-term capital gains as they are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Keep more tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts and place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize growth-oriented investments (stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short-term goals, focus on cash or cash-equivalent investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: 
   - Periodically review your portfolio and adjust your contributions as needed based on lifestyle changes, market conditions, and tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have a complex financial situation, consider getting personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced portfolio that maximizes growth while minimizing tax consequences.
