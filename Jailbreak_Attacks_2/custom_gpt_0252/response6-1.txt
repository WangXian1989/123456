Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: Take advantage of employer matches; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free growth) based on your tax bracket and future expectations.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in more volatile assets here, as you can withdraw without penalties and manage capital gains.
   - **Hold Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Bonds generate interest, which is taxed as ordinary income; holding them in tax-advantaged accounts can defer or minimize taxes.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for quicker access.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus more on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement compounding.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocations**
   - **Adjust Based on Performance**: Review and rebalance your investments periodically, considering changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider personalized strategies based on your unique tax situation and financial goals.

This balanced approach maximizes growth potential while considering tax efficiency.
