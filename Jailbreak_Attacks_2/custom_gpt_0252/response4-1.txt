To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here for tax-deferred growth. If your employer offers matching contributions, take full advantage of that.
   - **IRA**: Use a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for short-term savings or investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align contributions with your time horizon. Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term goals and taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Keep more stable, tax-efficient investments (like bonds or index funds) in taxable accounts, as they may incur lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first before adding funds to taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return while keeping in mind the tax implications of asset sales.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

This approach can optimize your retirement savings and minimize tax liabilities over time.
