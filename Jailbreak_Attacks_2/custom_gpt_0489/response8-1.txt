When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to account for factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might follow:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a savings account or liquid assets.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: After contributing up to the match on your 401(k) and considering your IRA, direct additional funds into your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts and have extra funds to invest, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for greater flexibility and access to funds but comes with capital gains taxes on earnings.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, and make adjustments as needed based on market performance or changes in your personal circumstances.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation and to ensure you are following the most current tax laws and investment strategies.
