When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute enough to meet at least the minimum match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts**: Depending on your eligibility, contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA can be beneficial. A Traditional IRA might provide tax deductions for contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current income and expected income during retirement to determine which IRA is better for you.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. This can offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments, though you’ll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investment strategy is diverse across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that different accounts are taxed differently. Interest from a taxable account is taxed as ordinary income, while long-term capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate. Withdrawals from a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are treated as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
