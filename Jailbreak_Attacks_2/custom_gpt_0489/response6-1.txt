The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, especially if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you need an immediate tax deduction.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These might be more appropriate for investments you plan to access before retirement, as funds can be withdrawn without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.
   - **Asset Location**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Analyze Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you’re younger and have a longer time to grow your investments, you might prioritize maximizing contributions to growth-oriented accounts (like a Roth IRA).
   - As you approach retirement, it may be prudent to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and objectives. Adjust contributions and withdrawals accordingly.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
