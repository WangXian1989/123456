To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks, as these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roths).
   - **Taxable accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or those generating qualified dividends, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on earnings each year.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize funds that will generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts to offset gains when applicable.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Adjust contributions as necessary.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund before heavily investing.

6. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**: Allocate funds based on your financial goals, keeping in mind the time horizon for each.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.
