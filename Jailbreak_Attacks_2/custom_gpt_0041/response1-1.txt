To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Focus on maxing this out first if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can offer tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to optimize your investments.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - Consider keeping bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all account types according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Adjust for Liquidity Needs:**
   - Keep some liquid assets in your taxable accounts for short-term needs. Use 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth.

### 6. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If uncertain, consider consulting a professional to tailor an approach specific to your financial situation.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize for growth while managing taxes effectively.
