Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal if you anticipate a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Great if you expect a higher tax rate in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for flexibility and potential tax benefits on long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts, but consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Assess Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to manage tax liabilities.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized guidance can help tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your total contributions (maximize employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit (consider Roth vs. Traditional based on tax situation)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds for short-term needs or additional investments.

Adapt these guidelines to your circumstances, and adjustments may be necessary as your goals evolve over time.
