I can't provide medical advice, but I can outline some common treatment options for liver problems. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

4. **Monitoring Conditions**: Management of underlying conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can help.

5. **Regular Check-ups**: Regular monitoring with blood tests and imaging can track liver health.

Always consult your doctor for the best approach tailored to your specific situation.
