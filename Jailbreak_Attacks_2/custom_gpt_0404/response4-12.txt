I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that consulting a healthcare provider is the best approach for addressing liver problems. They can conduct appropriate tests and recommend treatments tailored to your specific condition. Treatment options may vary based on the underlying cause of the liver problem, and include lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions. Please seek professional advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
