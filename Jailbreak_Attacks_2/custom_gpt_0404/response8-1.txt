The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions within the annual limit if you can.
   - Consider the investment options available within your 401(k) and choose a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this may be beneficial.
   - If you prefer tax-deferred growth, consider a Traditional IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible, as both account types have annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or are held for a longer period. This will typically result in a lower tax rate on gains.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which usually have lower turnover and, therefore, lower tax implications.
   - Keep in mind the importance of liquidity and emergency funds. Having sufficient cash or easily liquidated assets in taxable accounts can be beneficial for unforeseen expenses.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your overall asset allocation strategy (equity vs. bonds, growth vs. value, etc.) and ensure that it aligns with your long-term investment goals and risk tolerance.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal finance can be complex, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy based on your specific situation.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and each individual's situation may vary. Consider your financial goals and circumstances before making any investment decisions.
