The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The Roth IRA has tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while the Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Further 401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This will help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using taxable accounts for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or for short-term savings goals. Taxable accounts can also be more flexible for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can take into account your specific situation.

This strategy aims to balance tax efficiency with growth potential while considering your future financial needs.
