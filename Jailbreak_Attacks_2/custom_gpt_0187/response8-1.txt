Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral.

3. **Focus on Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and access without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market changes and personal goals.

### Summary
- **401(k)**: Maximize match first.
- **IRA**: Utilize for tax advantages.
- **Taxable**: After maxing retirement accounts, focus here for liquid assets.
