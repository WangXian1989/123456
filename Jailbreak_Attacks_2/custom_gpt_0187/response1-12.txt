I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications like antivirals for hepatitis or immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver diseases may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Natural Remedies**: Some people explore herbal supplements (consult a doctor first).

Always consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice!
