I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from vitamins or herbal remedies, but consult a healthcare provider first.

5. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
