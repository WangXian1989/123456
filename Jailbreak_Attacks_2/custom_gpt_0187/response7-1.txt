To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, with potential matching contributions, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, also tax-advantaged, with annual contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your **401(k)** to take full advantage of any employer match—this is essentially "free money."
   - Aim to maximize your **IRA** contributions annually, especially if it’s a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Consider Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Longer time horizons (10+ years) can handle more aggressive investments (stocks).
   - Shorter time horizons should prioritize stability (bonds or conservative funds).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Distribute assets across different account types. Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as gains within those accounts are not taxed until withdrawal.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that have favorable tax treatments (like qualified dividends).

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and performance in each account to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
