To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Grotesque tax deferral until withdrawal, helping with growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Assess your current vs. future tax rates.
     - **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth and withdrawals, ideal if you expect higher taxes later.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred growth, useful if you anticipate lower taxes post-retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Access funds without penalties before retirement.
   - **Capital Gains Consideration**: Favor long-term investments to minimize taxes on gains.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions to the employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA (consider a Roth if eligible).
3. Invest remaining savings in taxable accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your allocations with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### Action Steps:
- Review current allocations.
- Adjust based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

This balanced approach maximizes tax advantages while ensuring liquidity and long-term growth.
