When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it, usually in retirement. This can help lower your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. However, Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings (interest, dividends, and capital gains) in taxable accounts are subject to taxes in the year they are realized. This can affect your overall tax strategy.

2. **Retirement Goals**: Consider your retirement timeline and how much you expect to need. Maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) typically has benefits due to tax shielded growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 2023, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Prioritize maxing out employer matches in your 401(k) first.

4. **Investment Options**: The investment choices available in your 401(k) might be limited compared to an IRA or taxable account. Be sure to evaluate the fees and investment options in each account type.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Money in your taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, unlike funds in retirement accounts which are generally restricted until age 59½.

6. **Diversification**: Don't forget to consider your overall investment strategy. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. 

A common approach is to first contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA, and finally, use any remaining funds for taxable accounts. 

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these decisions to your specific situation.
