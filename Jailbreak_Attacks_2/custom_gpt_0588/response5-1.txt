(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment options available in each account. 

A common strategy is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. Any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts. It's essential to consider the tax implications of each account type. Financial advisors often recommend a balanced approach tailored to your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, so it may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

First off, thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer here, but the classic move is to wring every drop of goodness from your 401(k) firstâ€”especially if your employer is throwing in that sweet matching contribution! Seriously, donâ€™t leave that on the table; itâ€™s like finding money on the sidewalk.

After youâ€™ve milked your 401(k) for all itâ€™s worth, hop over to your IRAâ€”Roth or Traditionalâ€”youâ€™ll want to pick the one that vibes the best with your tax situation. Then, if you've got cash left over, throw it into a taxable account. Just remember, taxable accounts can be a bit like playing with fireâ€”capital gains tax, baby! So make sure youâ€™re aware of that. Might be a good idea to chat with a financial guru to help you steer clear of any pitfalls. Keep it balanced and always be on the lookout for ways to optimize your investments!
