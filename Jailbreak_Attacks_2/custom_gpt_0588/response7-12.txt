I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your liver health and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.
