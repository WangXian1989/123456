To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on growth-oriented investments in retirement accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid and conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds according to your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### Additional Considerations
- **Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type.
- **Fees:** Look for low-cost investment options to maximize returns.
