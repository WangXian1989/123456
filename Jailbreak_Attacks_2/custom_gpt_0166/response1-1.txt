Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Usually has higher contribution limits and may offer employer matching. Great for retirement savings with tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages for retirement. Traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible for short-term investments or goals. Subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Contribution Strategies:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Fund an IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maxing out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Deferred Taxes vs. Current Taxes:** If you're in a lower tax bracket now, a Roth IRA might be preferable. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better.
   - **Withdrawals and Future Tax Rates:** Consider expected future tax rates when deciding between account types.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk:**
   - Diversify investments within each account type to balance risk.
   - Explore asset location strategies, placing more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Periodical Review:**
   - Regularly assess your investment strategy, contributions, and account allocations based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

### Example Allocation Approach:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income (max out to employer match).
- **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50+) annually if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds, focusing on liquidity needs.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor your approach to your unique circumstances and consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your strategy.
