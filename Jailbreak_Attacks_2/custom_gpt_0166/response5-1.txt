To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later. 
   - If you need tax deductions now, consider a Traditional IRA or 401(k).

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before using taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over age 50) and for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) that generate income, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your contributions and asset allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that takes advantage of tax efficiencies while working towards your long-term financial goals.
