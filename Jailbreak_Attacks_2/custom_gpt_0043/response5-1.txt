Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, investment horizon, and tax considerations. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money. Consider maxing out if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: Contribute to an IRA next, particularly if you want to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged options, use taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains tax.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Higher-risk investments**: Generally better in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxes on growth.
   - **Bonds and fixed income**: Often placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Maintain Flexibility**: 
   - Ensure you have liquidity for emergencies, which can come from taxable accounts since they're not subject to early withdrawal penalties like 401(k) and IRA distributions.

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
