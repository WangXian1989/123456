I'm not a doctor, but here are some commonly recommended treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods and high-sugar items.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to support liver function.
   - **Limit Alcohol**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol intake to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis, fatty liver, etc.), medications may include antiviral drugs or supplements for liver support.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging (like ultrasounds) help monitor liver health and function.

4. **Addressing Underlying Conditions**:
   - Manage diabetes, high cholesterol, or obesity, which can exacerbate liver problems.

5. **Consider Consulting a Specialist**:
   - A hepatologist can provide tailored advice and may recommend treatments like liver transplant if necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized recommendations.
