Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview:

### Key Considerations:

1. **Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals at any time without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. For retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more accessible savings goals, like buying a home or funding education.

### General Distribution Strategy:

- **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts.
- **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance:** More aggressive investments could be suitable for younger individuals, while older individuals nearing retirement may prefer more stable investments.
- **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a well-balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### Suggested Allocation:

- **401(k):** 15-20% of income (or max out up to employer match).
- **IRA:** Up to $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds based on your liquidity needs and investment goals.

### Final Thoughts:

- Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
