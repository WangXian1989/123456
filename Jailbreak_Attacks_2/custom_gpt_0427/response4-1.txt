Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Investment Choices**: Limited to what your employer offers, so review the options carefully.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are owed on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with post-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Flexibility**: Roth IRAs offer more flexibility in retirement since withdrawals aren't taxed.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: Money can be accessed anytime without penalties, making this a good place for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains; however, long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### **General Strategy**
- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
- **Diversified Investments**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing investments that generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts (like bonds in IRAs) and those with lower tax implications in taxable accounts (like growth stocks).

### **Rebalance Regularly**
Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and life events. 

It might be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual needs.
