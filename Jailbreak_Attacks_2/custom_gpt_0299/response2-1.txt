Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Use these for tax-advantaged investments (e.g., bonds, REITs).
   - **Taxable Account**: Focus on investments that generate capital gains (e.g., stocks) or tax-efficient ETFs and index funds. 

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account before heavily investing.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your unique circumstances.

This approach can help optimize your investments and manage tax implications effectively.
