To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that match first. Then, consider increasing your contributions up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, direct funds to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between these depends on your current tax bracket versus expected future tax bracket.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally, use taxable accounts for investments that might not fit well in a tax-advantaged account. This includes investments that generate high dividends or interest, as these are taxed at your income tax rate.
   - **Hold Investments Long-Term**: Favor long-term investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Consider asset locationâ€”more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative, lower-yield investments can go into taxable accounts.

5. **Revisit Regularly**: As your financial situation or tax laws change, revisit your distribution strategy regularly.

6. **Consult a Professional**: If your financial situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This balanced approach can help enhance tax efficiency and growth potential over the long term.
