Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions
- **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Percentage**: Aim for at least 15% of your income, including the match.

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA Contribution**: Once you’ve maxed out the 401(k) match, consider putting money into a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
  - **Traditional IRA**: Offers potential tax deductions.
  - **Roth IRA**: Grows tax-free and allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **After Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for more flexibility and liquidity.
- **Investment Strategy**: Focus on investments with favorable long-term capital gains tax treatment.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your distribution to adjust for market changes and ensure alignment with your goals.

### Considerations
- **Age & Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may lean more towards growth-oriented assets in taxable accounts, while those closer to retirement might prioritize stability.
- **Tax Bracket**: Understand how your income affects your contributions and potential tax liabilities.
