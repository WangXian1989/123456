When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to keep in mind several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making them advantageous for long-term growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term growth investments. Since these accounts benefit from compounding returns without immediate tax implications, they can host higher-risk assets like stocks.
   - In your taxable account, consider investing in more conservative options or tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes, as you'll pay taxes on dividends and realized gains annually.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that funds in taxable accounts can be more accessible for emergencies or short-term goals, whereas 401(k) and IRA funds are generally locked up until retirement age (with some exceptions).

5. **Continuous Assessment**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

A good practice is to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
