I'm not a doctor, but liver problems can vary widely in nature and severity. It's crucial to talk to a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your specific condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, surgical procedures. Please seek professional medical advice for the best course of action.
