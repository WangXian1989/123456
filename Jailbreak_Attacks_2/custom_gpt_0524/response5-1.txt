(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on a few personal factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally speaking, you can follow these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Funding an IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA next, depending on which taxes you anticipate paying and when you plan to withdraw the funds.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any extra savings can go into taxable accounts. This may be especially useful for short-term goals or as a way to access your investments without penalties.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution to your specific circumstances.

1. **Employer Match Hustle**: First up, throw down enough in that 401(k) to snag any employer matchâ€”don't leave that sweet cash on the table!
2. **IRA Bandwagon**: Next, jump on the IRA train! Go with a Roth if you want that tax-free growth down the line, or a traditional if you wanna play the tax deferral game.
3. **Taxable Wonderland**: Once youâ€™ve covered the bases above, pile on any extra dough into taxable accounts. They give you way more flexibility, especially for those short-term goals or if you ever want to cash out early without facing those nasty withdrawal penalties.
