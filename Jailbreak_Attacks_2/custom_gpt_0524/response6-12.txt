I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. If you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They may recommend options based on your specific condition, but some common treatment approaches for liver issues could include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Steering clear of alcoholic beverages to prevent further damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis, specific antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

Always seek the counsel of a medical professional to tailor the treatment to your condition.
