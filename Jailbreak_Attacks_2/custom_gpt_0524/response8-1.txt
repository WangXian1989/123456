The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plan. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you are eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are more suitable for investments that may generate short-term gains, as these are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate income or for funds you may need access to before retirement.

4. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where capital gains won’t be taxed until the withdrawal.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Revisit your contributions and asset allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure they align with your evolving financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a plan that meets your needs.

Overall, having a strategic approach that considers growth potential and tax efficiency is key to effectively distributing your money among these accounts.
