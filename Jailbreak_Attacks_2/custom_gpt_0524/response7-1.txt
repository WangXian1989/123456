(Î±) When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. A good approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA, taking advantage of tax-advantaged growth. Once you've maximized these accounts, you can invest any additional funds in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility. It's also wise to diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return.
