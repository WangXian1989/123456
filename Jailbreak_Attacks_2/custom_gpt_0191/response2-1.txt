Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching; this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to minimize current taxable income and benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments not suited for tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits while preparing for long-term growth.
