To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, focusing on tax-deferred growth. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is beneficial.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions next. Depending on your income and plan type, contributions can be tax-deductible.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If you have the option, consider Roth contributions within your 401(k) or a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio in each account, but consider the tax implications of certain investments. For instance, keep bonds (which may produce higher ordinary income) in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains treatment.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your contributions and investment performance, adjusting your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
