Balancing your contributions among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Useful for higher income earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your tax situation: if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be better.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

5. **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize accounts based on your timeframe:
   - Long-term retirement: Focus on 401(k) and IRAs.
   - Short-term goals: Fund taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Automate contributions to maintain consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review Annually**: Re-evaluate your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
