Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA after your 401(k) contributions, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, and for different asset classes that are tax-efficient, like municipal bonds.

3. **Consider Your Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments that may need to be accessed sooner.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure you have a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance, risk tolerance, and changes in your life circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider getting personalized advice to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, including tax implications.

Make sure to keep long-term goals and your individual financial situation in mind when making these decisions.
