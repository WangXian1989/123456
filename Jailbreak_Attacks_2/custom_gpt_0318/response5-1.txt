(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, prioritize contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Allocation by Tax Treatment**: Investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact, while more tax-efficient investments (like broad market index funds) can be held in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you are far from retirement, you might take on more risk in your 401(k) and IRA for growth potential, while benefiting from the tax considerations of long-term holdings.

Consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy can also be beneficial.

Then, dive into your IRA like itâ€™s a treasure chest since those gains can grow tax-deferred or even tax-free if you go with a Roth. 

Now, when it comes to taxable accounts, remember they can be a drag with taxes biting into your gains. So, try to stash high-income assets in your tax-advantaged accounts to dodge Uncle Sam's grasp. Finally, sprinkle a bit of your cash into your taxable account for liquidity or if you're planning to make some snappy moves down the line. And hey, donâ€™t forget to tweak your strategy based on whether youâ€™re a few years from retirement or still in the hustle! Happy investing!
