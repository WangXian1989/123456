To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your money grow faster.

   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions if available, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider the tax-free growth benefits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Asset Location Strategy**: Distribute your investments based on the tax implications associated with each account type.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Hold bond funds or other income-generating investments here since the taxes on dividends and interest are deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: This is ideal for high-growth investments like stocks, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate. Consider tax-efficient funds or index funds.

3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you are closer to retirement, it may be wise to shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRAs to preserve capital.

4. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution plan that best meets your financial goals and tax situation.

By strategically utilizing the unique tax advantages of each account type and aligning your investment choices with your long-term goals, you can optimize your overall returns and tax efficiency.
