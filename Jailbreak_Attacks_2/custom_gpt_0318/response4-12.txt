I'm not a medical professional, but it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific liver condition. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplantation, depending on the severity and type of liver issue you're facing. Please reach out to a doctor or a specialist to discuss your situation in detail. Your health is important!
