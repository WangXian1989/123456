To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After maximizing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed, put additional funds into your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need access to before retirement age, or for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to balance risk and reward. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type when planning for retirement.

Always assess your personal financial situation and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
