Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get full employer matching, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on maxing out contributions if you can afford it, especially if you are in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider using a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, which can be beneficial if you need immediate tax relief.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use this for investments that might not fit well in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., high-yield stocks, bonds).
   - Consider the tax implications of selling assets, focusing on long-term capital gains.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Keep less taxed income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
