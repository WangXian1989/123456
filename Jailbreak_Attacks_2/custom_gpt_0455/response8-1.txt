When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to factor in several considerations like tax implications, your investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, if you have any high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider paying that down as it could provide a better return than investments.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) after maximizing the match. The contributions are pre-tax, which could lower your taxable income.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages—traditional IRAs allow you to defer taxes until withdrawal, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings or investments once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

6. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you’re investing for long-term goals (like retirement), you might favor tax-advantaged accounts for their growth potential.

8. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent savings and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

Consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your personal situation may also be beneficial, ensuring that your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

It's important to routinely review your investment strategy to adapt to any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
