I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific condition, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Please make sure to discuss your situation with a qualified healthcare provider for accurate diagnosis and treatment options.
