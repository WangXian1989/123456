To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**: Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, based on your tax situation. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Maximize Contributions**: For both your 401(k) and IRA, try to max out your contributions each year if feasible. The current limit for 401(k) contributions is $20,500 (for 2022, higher limits apply if over 50), and for IRAs itâ€™s $6,000 (again higher for those over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity, but keep in mind they'll be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, focus on a diversified mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations in each account to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a balanced and strategic approach to your investment distribution.
