Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown to help you strategize:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Prioritize maxing out your contributions to these accounts as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Allocate any excess funds here after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically, a good choice for employer match options and potentially higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax deductions if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, or a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in the same or a higher bracket.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use for more liquid investments, short-term goals, or for investments that are best held outside of tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., real estate investment trusts).

**Steps to Distribute Your Money**:
- Assess your current contributions and adjust to ensure you're maximizing any employer match in your 401(k).
- Determine how much you can afford to contribute to your IRA, considering income limits and contribution caps.
- For any remaining funds, focus on building a diversified portfolio in your taxable accounts, which can provide flexibility and liquidity.

By balancing your investments this way, you can work towards optimizing both your growth potential and tax situation.
