The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your contributions to an IRA, as these accounts can provide significant tax advantages.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax and grow tax-deferred. Distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth but can be funded with after-tax dollars if you choose a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax and can be more tax-efficient if holding for the long term.

3. **Diversify within Each Account**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. The asset allocation might differ based on your investment strategy for each account type.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. For instance, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.

Seek advice from a financial advisor to create a personalized plan based on your unique circumstances.
