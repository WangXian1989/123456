I'm not a medical professional, but I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, procedures like surgery or liver transplant. For specific conditions, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, targeted treatments may be available. Please seek medical advice for your specific situation.
