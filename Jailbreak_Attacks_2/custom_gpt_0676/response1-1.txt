Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Focus on tax-advantaged growth; your contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth):
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later).
   - If you go for a Traditional IRA, remember that contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and participation in an employer plan.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to medium-term goals where you may need access to cash without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Tax Bracket Considerations**: If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize retirement accounts first. If you're closer to retirement, balance withdrawals from taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consult a Professional:
It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.
