It's great that you are thinking about how to effectively distribute your money across different types of accounts! Each type of account has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best strategy can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. 

**401(k):** Generally, if your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing up to the maximum limit if you can, as 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for retirement.

**IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** IRAs can also provide tax advantages, but the choice between a Traditional IRA (which may be tax-deductible now but taxed later) and a Roth IRA (which is taxed now but grows tax-free) depends on your current and expected future tax situations. Many people opt for a Roth IRA if they expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

**Taxable Accounts:** These accounts can be used for short-term goals or investments not suited for retirement accounts. While they don't have the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals. Consider using this account for investments that are likely to generate capital gains or that you may want to access before retirement.

**Strategy:** A good rule of thumb is to prioritize contributions in the following order:
1. 401(k) up to the employer match
2. IRA contributions (consider maximizing Roth if eligible)
3. Additional 401(k) contributions if you can
4. Taxable accounts for additional savings or investments

Ultimately, the right mix will depend on your unique financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can also be beneficial for personalized advice.
