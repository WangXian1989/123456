Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to its limit. Check if your plan offers good investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as stocks you might hold long-term, which can benefit from lower capital gains rates. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies as well.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts to align with your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to stay aligned with your investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
