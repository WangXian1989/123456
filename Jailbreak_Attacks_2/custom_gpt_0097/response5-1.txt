Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k):** After meeting the match, consider contributing to a 401(k) up to the maximum limit. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income now.

### 3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve contributed to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for greater flexibility. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds earlier than retirement age.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across various asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and life changes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It’s often beneficial to seek personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach helps maximize growth while managing tax efficiency according to your financial needs.
