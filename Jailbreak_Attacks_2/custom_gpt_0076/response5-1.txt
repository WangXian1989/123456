Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax situation and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's free money.

2. **Fund a Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA next. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing the Roth IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute as much as possible (up to the limit), focusing on traditional pre-tax contributions for tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds left over can go into a taxable brokerage account. This can be useful for more accessible funds, especially for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure an appropriate mix of assets (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
