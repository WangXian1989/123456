Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a strategy to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.
- **Contribute to IRA:** If you're eligible, max out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits.
  
### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Tax Rates:** Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Traditional accounts provide a tax deduction now but tax withdrawals later. Roth accounts are taxed now but not on withdrawals.
  
### 3. Balance Risk and Withdrawals
- **401(k) and IRA:** Use these for long-term growth and to take advantage of compounding. Focus on equity investments here.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments that you might need in the short term. This can include bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

### Summary
- **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first.**
- **Consider your tax situation and investment timeline.**
- **Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and growth.**

This approach will help optimize your investment strategy while minimizing tax liabilities.
