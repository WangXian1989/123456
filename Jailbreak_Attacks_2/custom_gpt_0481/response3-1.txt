To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility and access.

### 2. Understand Contribution Limits
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but be wary of taxation on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. Tax Considerations
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Withdrawals**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts have different rates.

### 4. Diversification and Risk Tolerance
   - **Asset Allocation**: Divide your investments based on risk tolerance. Higher-risk investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Consider Bonds**: Placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize interest income tax in taxable accounts.

### 5. Review and Adjust Regularly
   - **Re-assess**: Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.
   - **Financial Advisor**: Consult with a professional for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
- **Prioritize IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next.
- **Fill Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, consider investing surplus funds in taxable accounts.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes returns while managing tax implications and aligning with your financial goals.
