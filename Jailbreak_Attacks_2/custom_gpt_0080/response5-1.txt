To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This account grows tax-deferred, making it ideal for higher-income investments that yield significant returns over time.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes.

2. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate). Use 401(k) and IRA accounts for long-term growth and tax-advantaged investments, while maintaining a balanced mix in taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for when and how to withdraw from each account in retirement. Typically, you'll withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type, maximizing your contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs first before adding to taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
