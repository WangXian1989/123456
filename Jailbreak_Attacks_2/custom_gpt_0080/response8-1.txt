To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, for tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact. 

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use all accounts to diversify into stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread risk.

4. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Depending on your anticipated income in retirement, you may want to favor tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA.

5. **Adjust for Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep enough in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your target investment strategy.

By balancing contributions between these accounts thoughtfully, you can optimize your tax situation and growth potential for retirement.
