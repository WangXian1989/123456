Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income; consider a traditional 401(k) for tax deferral or a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals if eligible; otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs for investments that may generate income or long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use them for shorter-term goals or investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investment strategies (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate).
- **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in financial goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start with employer benefits, leverage tax-advantaged accounts first, and complement with taxable investments based on your unique financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies.
