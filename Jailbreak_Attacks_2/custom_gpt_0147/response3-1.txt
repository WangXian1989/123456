Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several key considerations:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your current vs. future tax brackets.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Helps reduce taxable income now; pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for money you might need before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Consider more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts for growth (like stocks).
   - **Bond Allocation**: Place bonds in taxable accounts where taxes on interest can be deferred longer.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep an emergency fund in a taxable account for easy access without penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.
