Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, but taxed upon withdrawal).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts only after optimizing tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts can provide liquidity but are subject to capital gains tax on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Stocks generally offer higher returns but come with higher risk, while bonds are typically more stable.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
