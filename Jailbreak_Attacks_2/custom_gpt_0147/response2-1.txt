Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Contributions are usually pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), impacting your current and future tax obligations.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Favor long-term investments held over a year to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your investment strategy reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account separate from retirement accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

### 6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions periodically, adjusting based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and help optimize your investment strategy.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your money across different accounts.
