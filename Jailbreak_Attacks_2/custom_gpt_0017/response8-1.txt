Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in a taxable account for emergencies, typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

4. **Balance Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access sooner.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing goals, market performance, and retirement timelines.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific needs can help optimize your investment approach.

Make sure to consider your personal financial situation, and consult a professional if needed!
