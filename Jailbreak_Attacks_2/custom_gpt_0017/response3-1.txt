To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income. Invest for growth since youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with different contribution limits and eligibility rules.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use higher growth options in your tax-advantaged accounts, and consider more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals from each account type carefully to manage your tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

By keeping these considerations in mind, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
