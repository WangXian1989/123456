Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer matches contributions. This provides immediate tax benefits and helps you save for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments beyond retirement contributions. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Implications**: Prioritize accounts in order of tax efficiency. Generally, tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) are preferred for high-growth investments due to tax advantages.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before aggressive investing.
- **Investment Strategy**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance, with a balanced mix of equities and bonds across accounts.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match, possibly maxing out.
2. **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any excess funds, focusing on tax efficiency.

### Regular Review:
Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to adjust based on changing financial goals and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
