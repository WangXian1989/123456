The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Choose higher-risk investments if youâ€™re several years away from retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: With a Traditional IRA, you get a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to meet the annual contribution limits, prioritizing a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.

### Suggested Strategy
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to the match, then fund your IRA. After maxing out retirement accounts, invest additional savings in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Assets**: Regularly review your asset allocation across accounts to align with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Tax Impact**: Monitor withdrawals from taxable accounts carefully to manage capital gains and dividends.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that fits your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
