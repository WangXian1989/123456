Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After getting the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and eligibility, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (after-tax). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These accounts are useful for short- to medium-term goals since they can be accessed without penalty. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Balancing Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments and hold more conservative investments in taxable accounts to optimize capital gains taxation.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation, ensuring that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Consider these factors and adjust your contributions based on your overall financial plan and market conditions.
