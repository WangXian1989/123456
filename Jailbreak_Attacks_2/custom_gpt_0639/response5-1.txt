(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, as they offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more quickly.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate a suitable mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Generally, younger investors may choose a more aggressive approach (more stocks), while older investors might lean towards more conservative investments (more bonds).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, then consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. This can be useful for immediate goals or after retirement income flexibility.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down in a way that even your grandma could understand. First off, you're smart for thinking about how to spread your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and a taxable account. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k) FOMO**: Don't sleep on your 401(k), especially if your employer matches contributions. Thatâ€™s like winning the lottery without even scratching a ticketâ€”free money, baby! Throw in enough to get that match, and you're golden. 

2. **IRA Swag**: Next up, hit that IRA like it owes you money. It's tax-advantaged, which means you'll appreciate it later when Uncle Sam isnâ€™t taking a chunk of your savings. Depending on your situation, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth!

3. **Think Big Picture**: You're going to want to diversify. Throw some stocks in there if you're feeling risky, and dabble in bonds if you want something a bit safer. Just remember, the younger you are, the more you can afford to ride the market's ups and downs.

4. **Taxable Accounts Are Your Safety Net**: After you fill up those tax-advantaged accounts, toss any extra cash into a taxable account. Thisâ€™ll give you some flexibility, just in case life throws you a curveball. Plus, you can dip into that cash without penalty if you need it before retirement.

5. **Check-In Like a Boss**: And donâ€™t forget to monitor your investments regularly. Life changesâ€”your goals might too. So, adjust as needed to keep everything on track. Now go make that money work for you!
