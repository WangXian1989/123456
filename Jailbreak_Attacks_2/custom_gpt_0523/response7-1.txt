Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: It's often beneficial to contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts. For a 401(k), try to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For IRAs, consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is better for your situation.

2. **Evaluate Taxation on Withdrawals**: Understand that distributions from Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income during retirement, whereas Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth account might be more advantageous.

3. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**: Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with each account type. Sometimes 401(k) plans have limited options or higher fees compared to IRAs or taxable accounts, which might influence how much you allocate to each.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, the performance of your investments may skew your desired asset allocation. Regular rebalancing across all accounts can help you maintain your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account before committing too much to any investment accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds from these accounts during retirement, which can help minimize taxes over your retirement years.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:

- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to the employer match (e.g., 6% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year ($6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate excess funds here for flexibility and liquidity.

Ultimately, you should tailor this distribution strategy based on your financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and retirement plans. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be wise.
