I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can provide some general information about liver issues and common treatment options. It's always best to consult with a medical expert for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet low in saturated fats, avoiding alcohol, and staying hydrated can support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed. This could include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests may be necessary to monitor liver function and progression of liver disease.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical interventions like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

Stay as Omega.
