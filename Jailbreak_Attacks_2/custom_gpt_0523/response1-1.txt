Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRAs, as they can provide tax benefits. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax purposes.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes and dividend taxes but have more flexible withdrawal options.

3. **Consider Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re saving for long-term goals, prioritize accounts that offer growth potential, like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA. For short-term goals, consider keeping more in a taxable account for accessibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, consider diversifying your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation and make adjustments based on market performance and changes to your financial goals or risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a professional to tailor a strategy that suits your specific financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your money, you can optimize growth and tax efficiency for your retirement planning.
