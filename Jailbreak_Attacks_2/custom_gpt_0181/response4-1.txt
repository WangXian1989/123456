Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Prioritize accounts based on tax benefits. For example, if you're in a high tax bracket, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be beneficial. If you expect a higher tax rate in retirement, a Roth IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you may need before retirement or for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or long-term capital gains.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocation regularly to adjust based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions with employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, considering your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest remaining funds, prioritizing low-turnover investments.

It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
