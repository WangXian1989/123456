When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several key factors to keep in mind:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
- **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments generate capital gains and income, both of which are taxable in the year they're realized. 

### 2. Contribution Limits
- **401(k)**: Typically allows for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those aged 50 or older).
- **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those aged 50 or older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limit, but you should consider how much you can invest after accounting for living expenses and an emergency fund.

### 3. Investment Goals and Time Horizon
- **401(k) and IRA**: Generally more suited for long-term growth since penalties are imposed for early withdrawal before age 59Â½.
- **Taxable Accounts**: More flexible for short- to medium-term goals. Suitable for investments you may want to access without penalties.

### 4. Asset Allocation
- Diversifying your investments across these accounts can help you manage risks and taxes more effectively. For instance, you might hold bonds in a tax-advantaged account (like a 401(k) or IRA) where interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate. In contrast, holding stocks in a taxable account may be advantageous, as capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. Cash Flow Needs
- Assess your liquidity needs: if you may need to access funds soon, taxable accounts provide more flexibility without penalties. 

### Suggested Approach
1. **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, this can provide tax diversification benefits for retirement.
3. **Fund the 401(k)**: After you've maxed out the IRA contributions, continue to maximize contributions to your 401(k).
4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: As your savings grow, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional growth potential outside retirement accounts.
5. **Regularly Reassess**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or goals.

Each individual's circumstances will vary, so it may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
