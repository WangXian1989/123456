The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy). IRAs often provide more investment options than 401(k)s and have tax advantages.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing any IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. A 401(k) allows for significant pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have additional funds to invest after contributing to retirement accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, though they do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Think about where to place your investments based on tax efficiency. For example, consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) while placing more aggressive growth investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of capital gains tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals, ensuring no particular account or asset class is over or under-represented.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given your unique financial situation and goals, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice and help optimize your overall investment strategy.

This strategy can vary widely based on individual circumstances, so it's essential to tailor it to your personal financial landscape.
