It's important to approach the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts with a strategic mindset, considering both your short-term and long-term financial goals. Here’s a guide to help:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches:**
   If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you lower your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - If you go with a Traditional IRA, you get tax-deferred growth, similar to a 401(k). Withdrawals will also be taxed as ordinary income.
     - A Roth IRA differs because contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer the least tax advantage compared to retirement accounts but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. You’ll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   Consider placing investments that may have high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Conservative investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts while considering the capital gains tax that may apply.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   In retirement, a common strategy is to withdraw from taxable accounts first for several years to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing. Afterward, consider withdrawing from traditional accounts to minimize taxation over your retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:**
   Ensure you have an emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) and any money set aside for short-term goals in a high-yield savings account or taxable account.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your individual financial circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your situation.
