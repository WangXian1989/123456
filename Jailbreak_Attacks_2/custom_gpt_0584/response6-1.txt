Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider making contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation (traditional offers tax-deferred growth while Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may incur short-term capital gains taxes or for more liquid funds since they are taxed differently than retirement accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Place more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, in taxable accounts, while putting higher growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Evaluate Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate investments based on how comfortable you are with risk and how long you plan to keep the investments before tapping into them.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation and adapt to changing market conditions.

Allocating funds effectively requires regular assessment of your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
