Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Retirement Account Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Aim for the annual contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts** (Roth IRA): Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on earnings and are less tax-efficient.

### 3. **Allocate Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Fund your taxable accounts for easier access to cash for upcoming needs.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts for better growth potential over time.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - *Across Accounts*: Maintain a diverse asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk. 
   - *Consider Investment Types*: Use higher-risk investments for long-term accounts, while maintaining conservative investments in taxable accounts for stability.

### Implementation Example
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match, then max out if feasible.
- **Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute after maxing your 401(k).
- **Taxable Account**: Use any extra funds for savings and investments, focusing on tax-efficient options.

### Final Tips
- **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations yearly or as your financial situation changes.
- **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.

Consider your unique financial situation and goals to create a balanced distribution tailored to your needs!
