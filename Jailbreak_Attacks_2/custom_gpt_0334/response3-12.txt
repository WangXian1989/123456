I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limit alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function may be necessary.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or even liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some might explore herbal supplements, but consult with a healthcare professional before trying any.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
