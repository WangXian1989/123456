Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth.
   - Aim to max out contributions in these accounts before allocating significant funds to taxable accounts.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Traditional Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions can reduce your taxable income, which is beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for funds you'll need before retirement or for more flexible withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategies**
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Balance your portfolio among stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents based on your age and risk appetite.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help tailor a distribution strategy that fits your unique situation.

This approach helps optimize your savings while considering tax impacts and your financial goals.
