Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. Consider increasing contributions to reach the annual limit if you're in a lower tax bracket now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: This is useful if you want tax-deductible contributions. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you meet your tax-advantaged contribution limits, consider allocating funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexible access to your money.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations regularly to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Consider your long-term goals and consult with a financial planner for a strategy specific to your circumstances.
