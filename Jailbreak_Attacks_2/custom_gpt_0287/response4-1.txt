To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then focus on maxing out your contributions (up to $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Aim to fully fund your IRA (up to $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older) if you’re eligible.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically, you’ll want to hold assets with higher growth potential (like stocks) in these accounts, as they grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds) that generate lower taxable income.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax impacts; consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.
