To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching; contributions are pre-tax.
   - **IRA:** Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax); tax advantages vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax benefits; capital gains and dividends taxed.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match first—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Consider maxing out IRA contributions if eligible for Roth or traditional benefits.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
     - Hold investments with lower turnover (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains.
     - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Balance your portfolio across accounts while adapting to each account’s tax implications.
   - Choose growth-oriented investments for tax-deferred accounts and income-generating assets for taxable accounts to manage tax burdens effectively.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

Implementing these strategies can maximize your long-term growth while minimizing tax impact effectively.
