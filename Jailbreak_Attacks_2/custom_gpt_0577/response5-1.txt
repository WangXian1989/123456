(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, you might choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It's wise to max out your IRA contributions after funding your 401(k), as IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for additional savings once you have maxed out tax-advantaged options. Ideal for investments that may generate capital gains, they can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. 

Consider your current and expected future tax situation, time until retirement, and investment preferences when determining the right balance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! Distributing your dough across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like managing a three-course dinner â€” each has its flavor and place at the table.

1. **401(k)**: First up, if your employerâ€™s throwing cash at you with a match, snag that freebie! After that, crank up the contributions â€” look to max out if you can. You're basically getting a tax break here, and who doesn't want that? Just remember, itâ€™s all fun and games until you hit retirement age and start the withdrawals.

2. **IRA**: Next course: the IRA! Decide between a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your future tax game plan. Aim to max that bad boy out once you're good with the 401(k). More options usually mean you can really diversify without feeling boxed in.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, we dive into the taxable accounts. Once you've stuffed those tax-deferred options, go wild here. These are great for flexibility. Just keep in mind: any gains are gonna be taxed, so know your strategies, especially when it comes time to cash out.

Mix it all up based on your risk appetite and timeline. Itâ€™s all about what fits your financial taste!
