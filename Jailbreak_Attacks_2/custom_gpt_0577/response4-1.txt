Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Once you max out the match on your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA** offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts** will incur capital gains taxes, so consider placing investments that generate high dividends or interest here to manage tax impact.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. Each account can hold different asset classes to balance risk and return.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts can be taken first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your specific financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a house) and the time horizon for those goals. Longer-term goals can be more aggressive in growth-oriented investments.

7. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws.
