When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors need to be considered to optimize tax efficiency and investment growth. Here are some strategies to guide you:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions to reach annual limits (currently $22,500 for 2024, with a $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your tax situation). For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500, with a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This is beneficial during your working years but can be a downside in retirement if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Here, focus on investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified. This involves a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalancing and Withdrawal Strategy**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. In retirement, establish a withdrawal strategy that minimizes your tax liability, such as drawing from taxable accounts first.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial professional can help tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.

By focusing on tax efficiency and maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, you can build a robust investment strategy that serves you well now and in the future.
