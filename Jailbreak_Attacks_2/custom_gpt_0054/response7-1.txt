It's essential to consider several factors when distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as regular income, while Roth withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient amount in highly liquid assets outside your retirement accounts for emergencies.

5. **Invest for Growth**: Use your taxable accounts for more aggressive investments if you're comfortable with the risks, since they can be held long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.

Make sure you evaluate your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline before making any investment decisions.
