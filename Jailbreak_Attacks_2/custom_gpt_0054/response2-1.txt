Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). This provides tax advantages for retirement savings.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before investing heavily in taxable accounts, consider paying off any high-interest debt as that can offer a guaranteed return on investment.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. These provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (though you will be taxed on capital gains).

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, such as stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
