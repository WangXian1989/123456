I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver problems generally depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common treatments include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, regular exercise, reducing alcohol intake, and possibly medications to manage symptoms or underlying causes. In more severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or liver failure, advanced treatments may include liver transplant options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan.
