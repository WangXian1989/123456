I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Certain medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

Please seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
