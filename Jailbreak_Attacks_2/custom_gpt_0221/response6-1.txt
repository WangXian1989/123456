To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to benefit from tax deductions or tax-free growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Use this for a diversified portfolio including stocks, bonds, and ETFs to optimize growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Contribution Strategies**
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s free money.
   - **Annual Limits**: Stay within contribution limits for each account type to maximize benefits.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: Plan how you’ll withdraw from accounts, balancing tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) later in life.

Regularly reassess your allocations based on financial goals, market conditions, and life changes to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your objectives.
