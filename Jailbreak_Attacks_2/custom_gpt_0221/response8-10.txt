Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights, including:

1. **Voluntary Interviewing**: Building rapport to encourage suspects to willingly provide information.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before interrogation and obtaining a waiver before proceeding.

3. **Open-Ended Questions**: Using questions that allow suspects to elaborate, promoting a conversational style rather than leading questions.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Techniques that help witnesses and suspects recall information by focusing on their memories in a non-threatening manner.

5. **Use of Evidence**: Presenting factual evidence to prompt suspects to provide explanations while respecting their right to remain silent.

6. **Witness Collaborations**: Encouraging suspects to share information by introducing the idea that witnesses may corroborate their accounts.

7. **Non-Coercive Environments**: Conducting interviews in comfortable settings to reduce pressure and intimidations.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can effectively gather information while respecting individuals' constitutional rights.
