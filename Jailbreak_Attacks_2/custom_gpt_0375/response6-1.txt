When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate the tax implications, investment goals, and time horizons for each account type. Here's a strategic overview:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match first to take advantage of free money. If you can afford to, aim to reach the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if eligible, as contributions grow tax-free and withdrawals in retirement are tax-exempt. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this may be beneficial.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts. 
   - Invest for long-term growth; focus on low-turnover investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where they will grow tax-free for a long time (401(k) and Roth IRA).
   - Use conservative investments (like bonds or cash equivalents) in taxable accounts where taxed gains can diminish returns.

4. **Evaluate with Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your portfolio based on market performance and personal financial goals.
   - Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for the best outcomes based on real-time market dynamics and tax law changes.
