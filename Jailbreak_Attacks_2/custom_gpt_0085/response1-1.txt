When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) since they offer tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; withdrawals are taxable.
   - **IRA**: Tax benefits depend on whether it's a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxable in the year they're realized.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for emergency funds or short-term goals since they’re more accessible without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on the asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation.
