To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fund your IRA. This can be a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax strategy.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Understand the annual limits for each account type to optimize contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally hold investments with lower expected tax burdens (like index funds) or investments you might hold for the long term to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust Based on Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, lean towards Roth accounts. Otherwise, traditional accounts may offer more immediate tax benefits.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level and respond to market changes.
