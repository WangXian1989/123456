Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - These accounts typically offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal, usually in retirement.
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on a diversified investment strategy, considering target-date funds or a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. It's often ideal to contribute to this account if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are not tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free if certain conditions are met. This is an excellent option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - Diversify your investments, similar to your 401(k), but consider your time horizon and tax situation. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments that have appreciated.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxed income (like qualified dividends) or long-term growth stocks that you plan to hold for many years.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses in your taxable accounts.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA (Roth for tax-free growth if eligible, otherwise a Traditional).
- Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that aligns with your personal financial situation and retirement goals.
