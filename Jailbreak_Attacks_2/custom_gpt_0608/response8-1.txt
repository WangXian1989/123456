Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, long-term goals, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. With a Traditional IRA, you may benefit from tax deductions, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax money but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k). If you have the option, consider whether a Roth 401(k) makes sense for you.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for accessing funds and capital gains.

5. **Diversification:** Regardless of account type, ensure a diversified portfolio to manage risk. Balance between stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. For instance, long-term capital gains in a taxable account are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income from a 401(k) or IRA withdrawals.

7. **Revisit Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's important to review your allocation regularly and adjust as needed.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
