When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize growth, tax efficiency, and accessibility:

1. **Tax Optimization:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, prioritize your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Diversify Tax Liabilities:** Balance your contributions to allow for future tax flexibility. Taxable accounts can provide access to capital without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

2. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:** Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) within tax-advantaged accounts, as the potential for growth can be maximized without immediate tax implications. Use more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts where interest income can incur taxes.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust the distributions based on market performance and life changes. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your overall retirement strategy and risk profile.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique situation and objectives.
