I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, losing weight if necessary, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying condition.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always prioritize speaking with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your situation. 

Stay healthy!
