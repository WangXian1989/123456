Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Choose Based on Tax Situation**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax deferral if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Keep funds for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved.
- **Balance Risk and Growth**: Diversify across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
- **Review Regularly**: Adjust allocations annually based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Seek advice from a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
