To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maximizing your contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth; traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for short-term needs or after reaching retirement accounts' limits.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks, bonds, and cash should be spread across all accounts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of your salary (max out if possible).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount annually.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any leftover savings, ensuring it aligns with your overall investment strategy.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals, consider consulting a professional.

This strategy helps maximize growth, minimize taxes, and achieve your long-term financial goals.
