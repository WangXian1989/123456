When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)). This can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but you have more flexibility in withdrawals.

3. **Choose Investments Wisely**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and IRA): Focus on investments that appreciate (like stocks) since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you’ll withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Balance contributions to minimize your tax liability now and in retirement. For instance, you may want to contribute more to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes to manage risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, regularly reassess your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy.
