   - Avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Support**:

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
