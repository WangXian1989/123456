Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the match, consider increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but will be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth or riskier investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider placing income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, which may be taxed at a lower rate depending on your situation.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can assess your unique situation.

This approach provides a balanced strategy, optimizing tax efficiency while working toward your investment goals.
