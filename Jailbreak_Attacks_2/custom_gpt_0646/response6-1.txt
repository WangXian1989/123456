To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's free money. Consider maximizing your contribution if you can, as it lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you immediate tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. This gives you more liquidity and access to funds without penalties (like those applicable to early retirement account withdrawals).
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that may not perform as well in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy Considerations**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold higher-growth investments and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential growth.

4. **Reassessment and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Regularly reassess your investment strategy based on growth, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals.

By strategically prioritizing contributions and choosing suitable investment types for each account type, you can optimize your overall returns while managing tax implications effectively.
