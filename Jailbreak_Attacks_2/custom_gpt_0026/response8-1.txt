Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider making contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are ideal for short-term goals, with investments subject to capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), as they benefit more from tax deferral.
   - Keep less volatile or tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage capital gains.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Consider your liquidity needs. Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while retirement accounts have restrictions.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk according to your financial goals and timeline.

### Recommended Approach:
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions based on eligibility (traditional or Roth).
3. **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds here based on your time horizon and liquidity needs.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Monitor and rebalance your accounts periodically to ensure they align with your goals and changing financial conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
