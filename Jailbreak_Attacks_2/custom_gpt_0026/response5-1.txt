Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Tax Advantages
- **401(k):** Contributions lower your taxable income, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Ideal for high-income years.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Emergency Fund
Ensure you have enough in cash or accessible savings for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 3. Employer Match
Maximize your 401(k) contributions to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 4. Contribution Limits
Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize accounts based on limits and tax implications.

### 5. Taxable Accounts
Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Useful for short-term goals.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Max out employer match** in your 401(k).
2. **Contribute to an IRA** for additional tax advantages, especially if you qualify for deductions.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts** for liquidity and flexibility, especially if you reach retirement account limits.

### Adjust as Necessary
Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changing income, life circumstances, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice is also beneficial.
