The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower tax burdens (e.g., long-term capital gains) and tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments that benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your asset allocation is well-diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reevaluate your distribution periodically or whenever your financial situation changes to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
