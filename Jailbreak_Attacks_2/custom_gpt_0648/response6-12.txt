I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They may recommend options like:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

Make sure to get a proper diagnosis for targeted treatment.
