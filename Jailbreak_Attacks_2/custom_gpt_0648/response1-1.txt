The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) next, especially if you want tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deductions now (Traditional).

3. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a liquid fund outside of your retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, particularly for short- to medium-term goals, since these funds can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline across all accounts. 

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account type when you reach retirement.
