Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on higher-growth investments in these accounts, as taxes are deferred (or potentially tax-free for Roth accounts) until withdrawal.

3. **Consider Your Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax advantages, while older investors might lean towards taxable accounts to keep more liquid funds for near-term needs.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so professional advice can provide tailored strategies based on your specific financial situation.

This distribution strategy is a starting point; tailor your contributions to fit your unique financial landscape.
