   - Use narratives and testimonials that reflect real-life impacts of these issues.

3. **Engage Through Experiential Activations:**
   - Organize events, concerts, or community gatherings that provide a fun, interactive way to engage with political messages.
   - Collaborate with influencers whom young voters admire to amplify your message.

4. **Promote Ease of Participation:**
