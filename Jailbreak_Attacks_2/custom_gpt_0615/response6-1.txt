To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types and Benefits
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with match contributions; tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; tax advantages depending on type (Traditional or Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds; investments grow but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they provide tax benefits which can enhance your savings growth.

### 3. Diversification Strategy
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments according to your risk tolerance and retirement time frame across all accounts.
- **Tax Considerations**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) to defer taxes; consider placing income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalance
- Monitor your investments annually and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation, adapting to market changes and personal financial goals.

### Summary
Distributing funds effectively can enhance growth and tax efficiency. Start by maximizing employer contributions, then prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, and diversify wisely while regularly reviewing your strategy.
