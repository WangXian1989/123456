Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer matching, often with higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual retirement accounts with tax advantages, where contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts with no tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and are suitable for short-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRAs**: Aim to contribute the maximum to your IRA, especially if you're eligible for the tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term investments or if you have already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance & Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and how long until you need the funds.
   - **Diverse Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - **Adjust as Needed**: Revisit your distribution strategy regularly to adjust for changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to the 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
2. Max out a Traditional or Roth IRA.
3. Invest any additional funds in a taxable account, focusing on a diversified, tax-efficient strategy.

It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to personalize your strategy based on your unique situation and goals.
