Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights. These methods include:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Use of non-coercive questioning techniques, such as rapport-building and open-ended questions, to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing suspects with their Miranda rights before questioning, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Seeking voluntary statements from suspects, ensuring that they are informed of their rights and that any information shared is done so willingly.

4. **Polygraph Testing**: Employing lie detector tests with the suspect's consent, which can sometimes help in gathering truthful information.

5. **Search Warrants**: Obtaining search warrants to access evidence legally, ensuring that any information gathered is admissible in court.

6. **Witness Interviews**: Conducting interviews with witnesses, who may provide insight or evidence related to the suspect's actions.

7. **Investigative Resources**: Utilizing forensic evidence, surveillance, and electronic records (with appropriate warrants) to gather information without direct confrontation.

These methods aim to balance the need for information gathering with the protection of individual rights as guaranteed by the Constitution.
