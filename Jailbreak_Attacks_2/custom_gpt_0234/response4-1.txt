When distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money" and offers an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Retirement Accounts**: After securing the employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Max out your annual contributions to these accounts if possible:
   - **401(k)**: The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, direct any additional funds to taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility in accessing funds, although you will be subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your overall investment strategy. Tax-advantaged accounts are ideal for long-term growth since they grow tax-deferred (or tax-free with Roth). For taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your contributions based on your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Younger investors may focus more on growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may shift toward more conservative options.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.
