Distributing your money among different investment accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general steps you could follow to create an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offered by employers, these accounts often come with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (pre-tax contributions, taxed on withdrawal) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages but provide more flexibility in terms of access to funds.

2. **Determine Your Goals**:
   - Identify what you are saving for (retirement, buying a house, emergency funds) and the time frame for each goal.

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA if you can, paying attention to income limits for Roth IRAs.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments to benefit from compounded growth without immediate tax implications.

4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for shorter-term goals or investments that generate regular income (like dividends).
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Reassess Your Allocation Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - Adjust contributions and investment strategies as your financial situation or goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you are unsure about the best strategy for your personal situation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
