I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for any liver problems. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medications:**
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Medications to control symptoms and manage complications.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Abstaining from alcohol to reduce further liver damage.

Please see a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
