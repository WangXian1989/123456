To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal. If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals and may benefit from capital gains treatment on investments held for over a year.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your short-term (buying a house), medium-term (education), and long-term (retirement) financial goals.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type to maximize savings.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort with market volatility to select appropriate investments in each account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will access funds in retirement, considering tax implications for each account type.

6. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment portfolio as needed based on performance and changing goals.

A diversified approach across these accounts, tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, is often the most effective strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide additional personalized insights.
