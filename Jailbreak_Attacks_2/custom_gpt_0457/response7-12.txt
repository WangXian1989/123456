I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people find benefits from supplements such as milk thistle, but consult your doctor before starting any.

4. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as cirrhosis or liver failure, a liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific condition.
