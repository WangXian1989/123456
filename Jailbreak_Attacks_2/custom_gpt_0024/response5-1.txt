To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: If your 401(k) is maxed out, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Consider holding more stable, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as interest from bonds is taxed at regular income rates.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - In retirement, strategize withdrawals to minimize taxesâ€”consider the order in which you withdraw from accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep your desired asset allocation by rebalancing across all accounts as needed.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored strategies based on your specific circumstances.
