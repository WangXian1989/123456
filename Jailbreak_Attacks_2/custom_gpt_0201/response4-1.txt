Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Focus on tax-deferred growth**: Ideally, you should be in a higher tax bracket now than when you retire, making this a key vehicle for growth.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose between Traditional and Roth**: A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now with taxed withdrawals later, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals (ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement).
   - **Max out contributions** if possible, as IRAs often have lower fees and more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for short-term goals**: These funds can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - **Invest in tax-efficient assets**: Focus on index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax. Municipal bonds are also a tax-efficient option.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in an easily accessible account.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
- **Rebalance regularly**: Adjust your portfolio annually to stay aligned with your goals.

### Considerations:
- Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates.
- Consider age and retirement timeline—older individuals might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, while younger investors may benefit from more growth potential in taxable accounts.
