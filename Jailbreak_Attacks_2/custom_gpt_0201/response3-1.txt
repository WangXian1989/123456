Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out if you can; the contribution limits for 2024 are $23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those over 50.
  
- **IRA:** After maxing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The 2024 contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Choose a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**

- **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Withdrawals from a Traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income.
  
- **Taxable accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**

- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth. Emphasize stocks and growth-oriented investments here.
  
- **Taxable accounts:** Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, but prioritize more tax-efficient investment strategies.

### 4. **Rebalancing**

Review your asset allocation regularly and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target risk level. 

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**

If you're unsure, consulting with a financial advisor may be beneficial to tailor your plan to your specific financial situation. 

### Summary

A common approach is to:
- Max out any employer-matched 401(k) contributions.
- Contribute to an IRA.
- Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on tax efficiency.

Remember, this strategy may vary based on individual circumstances, so it's crucial to adapt it to your personal financial plan.
