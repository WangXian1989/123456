Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few key factors. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages depending on your income and goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes on withdrawals and gains. Utilize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments to maintain your desired allocation over time.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance can be beneficial.
