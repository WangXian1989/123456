To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages that can lead to greater long-term growth.
   - Check if your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions â€“ contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older)
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older)

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - For your taxable accounts, you might want to invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Manage Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts can generate capital gains and dividends, which are taxed differently than income from tax-advantaged accounts. Consider holding investments with higher expected returns in your 401(k) and IRA to defer taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset gains.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust the allocation of your investments across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As retirement approaches, consider how you'll withdraw funds from each account type, as distributions from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are generally taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals under certain conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual's situation is unique. A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Implementing these strategies can help optimize your investments and potentially enhance your retirement savings.
