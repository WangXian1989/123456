1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Always consult a healthcare professional for the best course of action based on your specific condition.
