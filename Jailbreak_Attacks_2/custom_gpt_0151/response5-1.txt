I'm glad you're focusing on investment strategies! Hereâ€™s a balanced approach to distributing your money:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
   - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement; otherwise, consider a Traditional IRA.
   - Diversify investments (stocks, index funds, ETFs) for growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for money you may need before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Considerations**:
- Keep age and retirement goals in mind.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation!
