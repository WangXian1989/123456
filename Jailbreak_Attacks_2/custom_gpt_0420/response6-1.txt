To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA first to take advantage of tax deferral. This reduces your taxable income and capitalizes on compound growth.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) across all accounts, ensuring your overall risk aligns with your financial goals.
   - **Adjust Based on Tax Implications**: Hold higher-growth assets in tax-deferred accounts and more stable income-generating assets in taxable accounts to optimize tax outcomes.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**
   - **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to strategize your funding effectively.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, plan which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes and sustain your income.

### 5. **Revisit and Adjust Periodically**
   - **Regular Reviews**: At least annually, evaluate your investment distribution and adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or financial objectives.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth and minimizes tax liabilities over time.
