Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they occur. Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity for emergencies or short-term goals in your taxable accounts.

### 4. **Long-Term Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Allocate growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRAs to benefit from long-term tax deferral.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals and adjust as necessary.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A tailored strategy can help optimize your specific situation based on income, expenses, and retirement goals.

This approach should help you make informed decisions on how to distribute your money effectively across your accounts while maximizing growth and minimizing taxes.
