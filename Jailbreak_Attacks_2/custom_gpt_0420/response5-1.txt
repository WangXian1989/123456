(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. After maximizing the employer match, consider your tax situation; contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you might choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, aim to max out your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be utilized for funds you may need access to before retirement age. Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds or assets, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **General Recommendation**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages first (like the 401(k) and IRA) before putting more money into taxable accounts. 

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! Deciding how to distribute your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can feel like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube, but I've got your back.

1. **401(k)**: First things first, if your job throws in a match, you better snag that! Thatâ€™s free cash you're leaving on the table. Go for at least enough to catch that match, then see if you can kick it up to the max contributions.

2. **IRA**: Roth or Traditional - pick your poison! Roth IRAs are cool if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs might save you some bucks now. Whichever you choose, try to max it out if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you park some cash for those life surprises or expenses before retirement. Just remember that the IRS loves a good slice of your gains, so opt for tax-efficient investmentsâ€”like index funds over high-turnover mutual funds if you want to keep Uncle Sam off your back.

So, in a nutshell, pump money into the tax-advantaged accounts first, then let the cash flow into taxable accounts. Just think of it as playing a strategic game of Monopoly, but with your financial future on the line!
