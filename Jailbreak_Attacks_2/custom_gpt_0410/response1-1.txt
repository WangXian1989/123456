Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and savings strategy. Here's a breakdown of considerations to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plan)**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match offered. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, the limit is $23,000, with an additional $7,500 if youâ€™re age 50 or older.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Types:** Consider if you want a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits:** The limit for 2024 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may be better if you want tax deductions now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Money can be accessed anytime without penalties. Ideal for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Tax:** Realize gains carefully, as they may be taxable at different rates.
   - **Investment Options:** You can invest in a wider variety of assets without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

### **Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions First:** At least until you get the full employer match.
2. **Consider Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Fill Traditional IRA Next:** If you benefit more from tax deductions.
4. **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts:** Once you max out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing surplus funds here for flexibility.

### **Other Considerations:**
- **Time Horizon:** Your age and when you plan to retire can dictate how aggressively you invest.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust asset allocation based on your comfort with risk.
- **Diversification:** Ensure you're diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, and a professional can provide valuable personalized advice.

By carefully considering these elements, you can create a balanced approach to your investments across all account types.
