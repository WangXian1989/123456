To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for high-income earners looking to defer taxes.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings here. Suitable for short-term goals or flexibility.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - Consider the contribution limits: for 2024, it’s $23,000 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (additional catch-up contributions are available if you’re over 50).

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - Longer horizons can bear more risk; focus on growth (stocks) in retirement accounts.
   - For taxable accounts, consider more conservative investments to balance risk and liquidity needs.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain a cash reserve in taxable accounts for emergencies.
   - Use retirement accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to improve risk management.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
