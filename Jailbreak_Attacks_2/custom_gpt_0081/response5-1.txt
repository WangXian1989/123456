Distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs allow for tax deductions.
   - **401(k):** Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if you're still eligible for tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for short-term needs and is essential for liquidity.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance:** Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and your changing goals.

### Considerations:
- **Investment Horizon:** Longer-term investments can be more aggressive; shorter-term needs may require more stable investments.
- **Tax Bracket:** Assess your current and expected future tax brackets to determine the best account types for your contributions.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan for how and when you will withdraw money, especially from tax-advantaged accounts to avoid penalties.
