Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can enhance your overall investment strategy and tax efficiency. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and offers tax deferral until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deferral; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes but provide flexibility without withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - If eligible, consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth.
   - Focus on filling up your 401(k) and IRA limits before using taxable accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., high-turnover funds, bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxed accounts for investments likely to generate low capital gains (like index funds).

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Longer time horizons should be more equity-heavy in all accounts, while approaching retirement may require a conservative shift.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations, considering performance, life changes, and tax implications.

### Conclusion
The best distribution varies based on individual circumstances, such as income level, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
