To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and traditional IRA. This allows your investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, consider Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k) contributions, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investment mix based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors might prefer more equities, while older investors may opt for more bonds.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate income taxed at lower rates (like long-term capital gains) or for funds you might need before retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without penalty.

Overall, itâ€™s often beneficial to seek advice from a financial planner to tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation.
