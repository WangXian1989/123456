(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to take into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA first, due to their tax benefits. For a 401(k), if your employer offers a match, ensure you contribute enough to receive the full match. Next, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income level and tax strategy. After maxing out these options, you can allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.
