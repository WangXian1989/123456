Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at lower rates. Also, this provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before aggressively investing. 

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) to minimize tax liability.

7. **Adjust Over Time**: Reassess your allocation as your financial situation or market conditions change.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
