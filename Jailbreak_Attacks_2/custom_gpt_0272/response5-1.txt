The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for investments that are not suited to retirement accounts (e.g., certain municipal bonds). This can also be beneficial for accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure that your investments within these accounts are well diversified. Consider factors like risk tolerance and time horizon when selecting specific investments for each account type.

5. **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications for each account. For instance, investments with high turnover or that generate significant income might be better suited in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate taxation.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- 401(k): Max out to employer match + 10-15%.
- IRA: Up to the contribution limit (currently $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if 50+).
- Taxable Account: Use remaining funds or savings for flexibility and short-term goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
