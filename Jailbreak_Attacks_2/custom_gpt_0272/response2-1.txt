To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money!). Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if your plan offers a Roth 401(k) option.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax deductibility or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to balance risk and return.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce capital gains taxes.
   - Keep higher-turnover investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger, lean towards aggressive growth strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As retirement nears, shift to more conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy across all accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
