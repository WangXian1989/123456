To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to capitalize on any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Max out contributions to benefit from tax-deductions (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).

### 2. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Balance between stocks, bonds, and other investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place investments with high expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and hold lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income; Roth withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends in taxable accounts are generally taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **Rebalance as Needed**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk and return profiles.

By focusing on these strategies, you can optimize your financial growth while managing tax implications effectively.
