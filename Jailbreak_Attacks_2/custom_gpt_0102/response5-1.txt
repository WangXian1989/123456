Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your retirement savings while considering tax implications. Here's a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** (401(k))
   - **Contribute enough** to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now; ideal if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free; good if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for money needed before retirement age or for investments that produce tax-efficient income.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk and pursue growth. 

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider your withdrawal strategy early. A balanced approach might involve drawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to minimize your tax burden over time.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: Max your contributions to get the match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a Traditional IRA otherwise.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest excess funds after maxing retirement account contributions.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy to your circumstances, considering factors like your income level, retirement age, and future tax expectations. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
