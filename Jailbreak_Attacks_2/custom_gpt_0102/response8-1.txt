Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a Roth for tax-free growth or a Traditional for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments that may need to access before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider putting bonds or less aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically based on market conditions and your changing risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
