Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 
   - **Diversify Contributions**: If you qualify for both, split contributions based on your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Keep funds for short-term needs or goals (like buying a house).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events and consider using tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Focus on 401(k) and IRA contributions first, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund in place before investing heavily in taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term Goals**: For long-term investments, consider holding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### Review Regularly:
- **Rebalance Allocations**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
