To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Max out employer-matched contributions in your 401(k).
   - Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced investment approach across all accounts to manage risk and maximize growth based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for future withdrawals: consider tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for your 401(k) and traditional IRA.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations annually based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your goals.
