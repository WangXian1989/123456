Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, it's wise to contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA for Tax-Free Growth**: If you qualify, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial due to its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Tax-Deferred Growth in IRAs/401(k)s**: Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s allow for tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw funds in retirement. Consider maxing out these contributions if you are in a lower tax bracket now.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for specific goals (like a home purchase). Be mindful of capital gains taxes in these accounts.

5. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: Align your asset allocation with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (stocks) can be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts since they benefit more from long-term growth.

6. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure you're not overly concentrated in one type of investment or account. Diversification can help manage risk.

7. **Review Regularly and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed based on market performance or changes in your financial situation.

It's best to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
