To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money that can boost your retirement savings significantly.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have initial tax advantages but offer flexibility and access to your funds without penalties. They are ideal for short-term goals and can utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Your investment strategy should align with your age, time horizon until retirement, and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive investments in equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds or more stable investments.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to ensure consistent saving and investing over time.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired level of risk and investment mix.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
