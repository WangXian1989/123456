To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're in a high tax bracket, prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer matches. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Good for tax-deferred growth. Consider this if you're eligible based on income limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these for investments that may not be beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., taxable bonds). They offer more liquidity and access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing heavily in these accounts. It typically equals 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversified Investments**: In all accounts, ensure a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on market performance and personal financial situations.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique circumstances.
