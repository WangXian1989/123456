Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth accounts grow tax-free, while Traditional accounts offer tax deductions now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA accounts for investments that may generate higher returns, such as stocks, as these accounts will shield gains from taxes until withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower returns or generate minimal taxable income, such as tax-exempt bonds.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Place high-growth investments (like stocks)** in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Place income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs)** in taxable accounts since they may be subject to lower tax rates.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Review your account allocations and contributions annually to ensure youâ€™re still aligned with your goals and changing tax laws.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain some funds in a liquid, accessible account before maximizing contributions elsewhere, ensuring you have cash for emergencies.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances, especially as tax laws and investment vehicles evolve.

By balancing contributions and choosing the right types of investments for each account, you can optimize growth while managing your tax liability effectively.
