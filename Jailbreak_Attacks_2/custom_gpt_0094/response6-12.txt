I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins while reducing processed foods and sugars.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals for Hepatitis**: If the issue is viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the condition.
   - **Liver Supplements**: Some supplements, like milk thistle, may support liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine Check-ups**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: In some cases, a biopsy might be needed to assess the extent of liver damage.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For severe damage, a transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss these options with your healthcare provider to determine the best approach for your specific situation.
