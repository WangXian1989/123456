Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income while growing your savings tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement. Capital gains and dividends are taxed, so consider tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes when withdrawing or selling investments.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k) to max employer match
- IRA to full contribution limit
- Remaining funds in taxable accounts
