Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**
   - Use for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.
   - Consider investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Consider holding more volatile investments (like stocks) in these accounts since theyâ€™re tax-advantaged.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Prefer more stable investments (like bonds) that may result in less taxable income.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocation at least annually and adjust based on your goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can tailor advice based on your specific situation, especially if you have complex needs.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income (maximizing employer match)
- **Roth IRA:** Max contribution limit (if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder for short-term needs or additional investments

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
