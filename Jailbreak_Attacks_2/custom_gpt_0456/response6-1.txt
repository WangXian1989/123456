To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contributions if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA, but be aware of the annual contribution limits. 

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, your tax implications will differ significantlyâ€”Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of potential capital gains taxes on investments held in these accounts.

3. **Investment Growth and Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long-term horizon, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for potentially higher growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or those you may want to access before retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is consistent across all accounts to maintain diversification and risk management.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your future withdrawals carefully; withdrawals from taxable accounts may be taxed differently compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

To summarize, a balanced strategy could be:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions, particularly to take advantage of any employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, investing only after maximizing tax-advantaged options.
