To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions, especially if it’s a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates. 
   - **Bond Investments**: Keep in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high tax rates on interest income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Use a mix of equity, bonds, and alternative investments according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for market changes.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to manage your tax liabilities. 

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment distributions for growth while minimizing taxes.
