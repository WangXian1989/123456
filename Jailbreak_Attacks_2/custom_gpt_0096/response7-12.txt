I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information on treatments for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and liver function.
   - **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to support overall health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or address the underlying issue (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**:
   - Severe liver conditions may require surgical interventions, including liver transplantation.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore supplements or herbal remedies, but consult your doctor before trying these, as they can interact with medications.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for the best outcomes.
