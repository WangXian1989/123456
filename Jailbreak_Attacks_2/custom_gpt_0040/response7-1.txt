The best approach to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 401(k)s, take full advantage of any employer match as this is essentially free money. Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your income eligibility.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid assets. Generally, 3 to 6 months' worth of living expenses is recommended.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, allocate a portion of your funds to stocks, bonds, or other assets within your accounts. Typically, younger investors are advised to take a more aggressive approach.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes and sectors to manage risk effectively.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Knowing which accounts to draw from first can help minimize taxes and maximize your retirement funds.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment allocations and financial goals, making adjustments as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
