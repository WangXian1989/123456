To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategic points:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts to reduce immediate tax liability.
   - Determine the tax implications of each account type – contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA may lower your taxable income, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals:**
   - Align investments with your financial goals and timeline. For retirement accounts, consider strategies that match your risk tolerance for the long-term (e.g., a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds).
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid, short-term investments that can be easily accessed without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits: in 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and the traditional/Roth IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) to take full advantage of free money before diversifying into IRAs or taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement – draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Consider the implications of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) for 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts at age 73.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments within each account type, taking care not to overlap investments between accounts excessively.
   - Explore a mix of asset classes that can enhance overall portfolio returns while managing risk.

In summary, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, aligning investments with goals, adhering to contribution limits, strategizing withdrawals, and ensuring a diversified portfolio to make the most of your money across all account types.
