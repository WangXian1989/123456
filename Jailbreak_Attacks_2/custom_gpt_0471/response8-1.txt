The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines to consider for an optimal distribution:

1. **401(k) Plan**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Selection**: Choose low-cost funds available within the plan, focusing on a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax-deferred growth. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to contribute up to the limit for IRAs ($6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older, as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use these accounts for funds you may need access to in the near future (e.g., emergency savings or major purchases).
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across these accounts, balancing high-growth investments (in taxable or Roth accounts) with safer investments (in tax-deferred accounts).

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting based on market performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.

In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before taxable accounts, while always ensuring that you have enough liquidity for short-term needs. Adjust your strategy over time as your financial situation evolves.
