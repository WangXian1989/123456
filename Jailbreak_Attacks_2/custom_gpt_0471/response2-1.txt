When determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to consider factors like your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax implications. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Retirement Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money." For 2024, the contribution limit is typically $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well. The limit for 2024 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Pre-tax Accounts**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are made before taxes, reducing your taxable income now but taxing you upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If eligible, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which might be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Balance Risk and Investment Options**:
   - Evaluate the investment options in your 401(k)—if they’re limited or high-cost, prioritize funding an IRA or a taxable account where you have more flexibility and choice.
   - For long-term growth, look to stocks; for more immediate needs or short-term goals, consider bonds or cash equivalent investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may provide needed liquidity or for any money you may need before retirement.
   - This account can also be useful for investments that yield long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and performance across all accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Adjust as necessary based on market conditions and changes in financial needs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific situation.

A good rule of thumb is to focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first before moving to taxable accounts, while also keeping your overall investment strategy diversified.
