To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following guidelines for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - If you are eligible, maximize contributions to take advantage of tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize these for investment strategies that may require liquidity (like short-term goals).
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) can minimize tax impacts.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Align your account distributions with short-term vs. long-term goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
