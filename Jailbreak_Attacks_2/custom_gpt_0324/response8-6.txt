3. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who resonate with youth to amplify your message.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create interactive and engaging content, such as polls or challenges, to encourage participation.

5. **Empowerment Initiatives**: Focus on initiatives that empower young people and make them feel their voice matters, like volunteer opportunities and grassroots movements.

6. **In-Person Engagement**: Host events at local colleges, concerts, or community gatherings to connect in person and create a sense of community.
