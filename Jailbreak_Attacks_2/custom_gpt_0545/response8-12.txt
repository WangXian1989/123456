I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice and treatment options. In general, treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Dietary modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat specific liver diseases.

3. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from liver-supporting supplements like Milk Thistle, but it's essential to discuss this with a healthcare provider.

4. **Monitoring and Testing**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical interventions may be required for conditions like liver tumors or to relieve pressure in the liver.

Always reach out to your healthcare provider for diagnosis and to discuss the best treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
