2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Drugs:** For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals can be effective.
   - **Corticosteroids:** May be used for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Medications for Symptoms:** Such as diuretics for fluid retention or lactulose for encephalopathy.

3. **Surgical Options:**
