To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Offered by employers, contributions can be tax-deferred or Roth (after-tax). Often has employer match opportunities.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth) offer tax benefits, but have contribution limits. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These have no contribution limits and offer flexibility but will incur taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing your employer match, prioritize funding your IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing here for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Continue to contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of its tax benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-risk, growth-oriented assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in your taxable account, where lower capital gains tax rates may apply.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Withdrawals from Traditional accounts will be taxed as regular income. Plan your withdrawals to minimize the tax impact.
   - For taxable accounts, utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains.

6. **Review Contribution Limits**: Stay informed about annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to avoid penalties.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your savings and investment strategy across these accounts.
