(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limits are higher here, so maximize your contributions if you can.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax strategy. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement. These accounts offer more flexibility but also have capital gains tax implications.

Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by taxable accounts, while regularly reviewing your investment allocations as your financial situation changes.

1. **Max out that 401(k)**: If thereâ€™s a company match, grab it! Itâ€™s basically like finding cash on the street. If your employer's throwing money at you, donâ€™t leave it on the table. Aim to hit the contribution limit if possible, because thatâ€™s where you get some serious tax deferral magic.

2. **IRA Game**: Decide if you want to roll with a Roth or Traditional IRAâ€”Roth is great if you want tax-free withdrawals later, while Traditional could be your jam if you want those deductions today. Make sure to hit those contribution limits as well!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibilityâ€”invest in stuff you might need to cash out before you hit the retirement zone. Just keep an eye on taxes since youâ€™ll be paying capital gains on any profits.

So, stack those tax-advantaged accounts at the top of your list and let those investments beast through the years. Adjust as you go, depending on life changes or market shifts! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’°
