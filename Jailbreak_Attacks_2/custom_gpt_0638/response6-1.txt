To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: IRAs offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible for withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax. Ideal for short-term needs and investments.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Maximize employer matches** in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs** (Roth or Traditional) next, based on your tax situation. Use Traditional IRAs if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement; choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher bracket.
   - **Use taxable accounts** for goals not aligned with retirement, such as buying a home or funding education.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) due to the long investment horizon and tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Diversify your assets. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds, maximizing tax efficiency.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest for growth but consider tax implications. Use tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. Regular Review:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

By following these principles, you can optimize your retirement savings and overall investment strategy while considering your current financial goals and future needs.
