When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) for higher income years to reduce current taxable income.
   - Use Roth accounts if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in taxable accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses without incurring penalties from retirement accounts.

4. **Investments and Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider the impact of capital gains tax in taxable accounts when making investment decisions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement by considering which account to withdraw from first to minimize taxes and penalties.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help you effectively balance contributions and optimize your investment strategy based on your individual circumstances.

Balancing contributions effectively can enhance your long-term financial growth while managing your tax liabilities.
