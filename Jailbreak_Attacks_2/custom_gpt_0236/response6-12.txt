I'm not a doctor, but there are several treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Changes:** Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Eliminate or significantly reduce alcohol intake.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Anti-inflammatory Drugs:** To reduce inflammation and damage.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** For severe liver damage or failure, transplant might be necessary.
   - **Non-invasive Procedures:** Such as endoscopic treatments for complications like varices.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Check-ups:** Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
