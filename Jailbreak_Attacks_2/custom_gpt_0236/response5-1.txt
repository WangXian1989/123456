Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **IRA and 401(k)**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts for tax advantages. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax deductions now, while Roth versions provide tax-free withdrawals later.

### 3. Consider Investment Goals
- **Long-Term vs. Short-Term**: Use retirement accounts for long-term growth and high-risk investments. Taxable accounts can be for investments needed in the short term.

### 4. Account Type Benefits
- **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices. Favor contributions here if your employer matches.
- **IRA**: Offers broader investment options. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Balance Asset Allocation
- Ensure that your investment mix aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. An overall balanced portfolio is crucial, regardless of account type.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Max out employer match.
2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any excess funds or more liquid investments.

### Review Regularly
- Monitor and adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market performance.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
