I’m not a doctor, but it’s important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver issues can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modification, weight management, and exercise.
2. **Medications**: Specific prescribed medications depending on the liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to monitor liver function.
4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can worsen liver health.
5. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor’s recommendations for the best outcome.
