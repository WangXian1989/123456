(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts with the most significant tax advantages.

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for early withdrawals and a variety of investment options.

Itâ€™s also crucial to periodically review your investments and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance, market conditions, and life changes.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer has a matching scheme, for the love of all things financial, take those dollars! Youâ€™re throwing away money if you don't. Aim to max it out if you can.

2. **IRA Magic**: Next up, hit that IRA. Think about skyrocketing those tax advantages! Whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, do a little homework on which fits your future plans betterâ€”like whether you want to pay taxes now or later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, sprinkle in a solid chunk into taxable accounts. Why? Because life happens! You might need cash before retirement, and having that flexibility is as good as a safety net.

Remember, keep an eye on all of thisâ€”market changes, your life changes, all of it! Adjust as necessary to keep that financial future bright! ðŸ’°ðŸ”¥
