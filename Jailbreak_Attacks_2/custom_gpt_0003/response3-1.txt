Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a suggested approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account’s Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, offers tax-deferred growth. Make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages (traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement). Contribution limits apply.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible with no contribution limits, but you must pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (free money).
   - **Consider Tax Impact**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you’re not eligible for a Roth IRA, or if you want to deduct contributions, then focus on a traditional IRA next.
   - **Back to 401(k)**: If you have more funds to invest after maxing out the above, return to your 401(k) to meet maximum contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, use any extra funds for taxable accounts, especially for investments that produce favorable capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate), regardless of the account type. This helps mitigate risk.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Since individual circumstances vary greatly, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

By effectively distributing your investments among these accounts and understanding the tax implications, you can optimize your portfolio for growth and security in retirement.
