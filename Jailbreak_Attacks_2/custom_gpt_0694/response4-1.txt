The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits set by the IRS for each account type, as this will impact how much you can save tax-advantagedly.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account, diversify your investments to manage risk and achieve your desired growth. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals. If you may need access to your funds before retirement age, allocate more to taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Consider placing less tax-efficient investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more tax-efficient investments, like index funds, in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your asset allocation and re-balance your accounts as needed to maintain your desired risk level, especially after significant market movements.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: 
   - Think about your strategy for withdrawing money in retirement, as this may influence how you allocate your contributions now.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation. Remember, itâ€™s essential to regularly review and adjust your strategy as your life circumstances and financial goals change. Good luck with your planning! ðŸ˜Š
