When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and investment options. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. If you're under 50, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500, and if you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 in catch-up contributions.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions and obtaining any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older. Choose between a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. You might want to hold certain types of investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation at least annually, considering changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and life events.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
