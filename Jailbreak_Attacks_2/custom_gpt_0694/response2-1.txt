The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts ultimately depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. However, here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in Your 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. These are good options if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These will not provide tax advantages, but they offer greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals and may be beneficial for short-term goals.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). This can help further reduce your taxable income (Traditional) or grow your investments tax-free (Roth).

4. **Balance Investments**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, invest any additional funds in a taxable account. This strategy can provide liquidity for emergencies or other financial goals.

5. **Re-evaluate Regularly**:
   - Your financial situation and goals may change, so it’s important to review your allocation periodically. Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or retirement timelines.

6. **Consult a Financial Planner**:
   - If you’re unsure or have complex financial circumstances, it may be helpful to consult a financial planner. They can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Remember, the key is to find a balance that aligns with your long-term goals while taking advantage of any tax benefits available. Good luck!
