(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After capturing any employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. You can choose a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions if you're eligible or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts Last:** Once you've maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is generally favorable for accessing your money more easily and diversifying your investments, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Investment Goals:** Depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance, your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) may differ across these accounts. For long-term growth, you might favor equities in retirement accounts, while using taxable accounts for more liquid or short-term needs.

5. **Review Regularly:** Regularly assess your contributions and allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.

1. **Snag That 401(k) Match First:** Seriously, if your companyâ€™s tossing you a match, grab it like itâ€™s free pizza at a party. Get your contributions lined up to snag that cash!

2. **Max Out Your IRA:** After that, go for the gold and max out your IRA. Youâ€™ve got choices here: Traditional for that nice tax deduction now, or Roth if you prefer to keep that future money tax-free. Itâ€™s like picking between ice cream flavorsâ€”just pick the one that excites you more!

3. **Taxable Accounts are Chill:** Only after youâ€™ve done the heavy lifting should you throw some cash into taxable accounts. Sure, theyâ€™re less tax-efficient, but they give you flexibility. Just donâ€™t throw all your cash there willy-nilly!

4. **Play the Long Game:** Think about your goals! You might want high-risk stocks in your retirement accounts (long-term ride!) and keep some safer options in taxable accounts, where you might need cash quicker.

5. **Check-in Regularly:** Life changes, so keep an eye on your game plan! Adjust as your needs shift. You want that financial strategy to grow with you, not hold you back. 

Now, go forth and conquer your finances! ðŸ’°ðŸš€
