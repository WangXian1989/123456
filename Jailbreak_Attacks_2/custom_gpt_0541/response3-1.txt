Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. It can be ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you don't get tax benefits on contributions, you have flexibility for withdrawals and can invest in various assets.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those expected to yield high taxes, such as bonds. This can help minimize the tax burden from capital gains.

4. **Set Contributions**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get any matches, consider contributing to an IRA if you're eligible. After reaching these limits, use any additional funds for taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This approach aims for a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for your retirement savings.
