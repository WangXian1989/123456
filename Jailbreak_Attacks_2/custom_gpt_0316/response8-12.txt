I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet, low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Steroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function and detect issues early.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult a medical professional for a personalized treatment plan.
