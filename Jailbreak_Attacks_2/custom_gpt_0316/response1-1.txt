Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**
     - Max out employer match first; it’s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**
     - Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on tax considerations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**
     - Use these for extra savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement; Traditional IRAs are taxed on withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year for favorable rates.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds suitable for your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: You have more flexibility; consider diversified funds or index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs) to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.

### 5. **Revisit Regularly**
   - Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to adjust your strategy accordingly.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income
- **IRA**: Max contribution (currently $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Account**: Remainder after maxing above
