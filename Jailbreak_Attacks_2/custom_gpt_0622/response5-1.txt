(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Generally, the optimal strategy includes prioritizing contributions to accounts with tax advantages. For example, if your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), itâ€™s advisable to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. Following that, maxing out contributions to your IRA can be beneficial, particularly if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts for more flexible access to your investments without penalties.

Next, hit your IRA hardâ€”like, think of those sweet tax breaks, especially with a Roth IRA! You want to enjoy your golden years without the IRS breathing down your neck. After you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts dry, go ahead and throw some cash into your taxable accounts. Just remember, theyâ€™re like the wild westâ€”more freedom, but Uncle Samâ€™s gonna want his cut at tax time.
