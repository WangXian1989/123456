When distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth):** 
     - A Traditional IRA also offers tax-deferred growth, but like a 401(k), withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - A Roth IRA involves after-tax contributions, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell assets. However, you can control when you realize gains, which offers tax planning flexibility.
   
3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - If you have a longer time until retirement and expect substantial growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where your investments can grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - For short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, prioritize taxable accounts where you can access contributions without penalties.

4. **Diversification:** 
   - Ensure your investment allocations (stocks, bonds, etc.) are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your investment allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses:** Evaluate the fees associated with each account type and choose investments within those accounts that have reasonable expense ratios.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, working with a financial advisor can help tailor your approach to your individual circumstances.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that optimizes your investments across these accounts.
