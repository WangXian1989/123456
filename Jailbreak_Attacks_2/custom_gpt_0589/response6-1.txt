To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Your Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Keep in mind your retirement age and when you'll need access to the funds.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out contributions to either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), depending on your tax situation.
   - Ensure you are aware of the contribution limits and the income thresholds for Roth IRA eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for goals such as buying a house.
   - This account can also be beneficial for tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset capital gains.

4. **Consider Investment Options:**
   - Diversify investments across accounts according to your risk tolerance.
   - High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review the distribution across all accounts to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

By following these strategies and considering your personal financial situation, you can create a comprehensive plan for distributing your money effectively across different account types. Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
