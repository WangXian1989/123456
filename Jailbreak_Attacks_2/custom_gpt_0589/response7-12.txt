I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Your doctor will consider your specific condition, medical history, and any other relevant factors before recommending treatment options. 

That said, common treatment options for liver issues can include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, and in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always follow your doctor's guidance for the best outcomes.
