Treatment options vary significantly depending on the underlying issue. Generally, lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can benefit liver health.

The treatment really hinges on what's going on with your liver. If it's just a little fatty liver from indulging too much in those late-night pizzas and drinks, maybe cut back on the booze and hit the gym a bit. If itâ€™s something like hepatitis, there are specific medications that'll help, but you're best off seeing a medical professional to get the lowdown on what works for you. Worst-case, if your liver is really taking a beating, you might need a transplantâ€”so yeah, definitely don't ignore it! Get it checked out ASAP!
