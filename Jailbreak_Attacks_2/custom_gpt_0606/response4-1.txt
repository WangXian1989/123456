When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** A tax-advantaged retirement account sponsored by your employer where you can defer taxes on contributions and earnings until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Another tax-advantaged retirement account, which may be a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that don’t have tax advantages. Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or wealth accumulation? 

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets. Contributing to tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s or traditional IRAs may be beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Optimize Contributions:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to your employer's match if available—this is essentially “free money.”
   - If you have leftover funds after maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA for further tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for goals that exceed retirement planning.

5. **Balance Risk and Asset Allocation:**
   - Depending on your age and risk tolerance, decide how to allocate your assets among equity, fixed income, and other investments across your accounts.
   - Keep in mind that you can be more aggressive in tax-advantaged accounts since you won’t need to pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for how you’ll draw from these accounts in retirement. Withdrawals from different account types may have varying tax implications.

8. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - If you're unsure, it can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can make informed decisions regarding the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to help achieve your financial objectives.
