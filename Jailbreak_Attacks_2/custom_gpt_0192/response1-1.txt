Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Understand Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - If you expect lower taxes, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age, or for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Regular Review:**
   - Revisit your distribution strategy regularly, adjusting based on life changes, market conditions, and your investment performance.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be very beneficial.
