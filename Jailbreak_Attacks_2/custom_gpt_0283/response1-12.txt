1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to track liver health.
4. **Supplements**: Some may recommend certain vitamins or herbal supplements, but consult a doctor first.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always ensure any treatment plan is guided by your healthcare provider.
