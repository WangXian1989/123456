I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options commonly discussed for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption, as it can further damage the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor health status.

4. **Liver Disease Management**:
   - If there's a specific liver condition (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis), treatments may vary, including antiviral medications for hepatitis.

5. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures may be needed, such as a liver transplant.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your situation.
