When considering the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to think through several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Utilize IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals.

2. **Balance Tax Treatment**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use your 401(k) and Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, which allows your investments to compound without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, especially if you might need to access funds before retirement.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, you might hold more aggressive growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Consider Bonds and Dividend Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: This strategy can help manage tax liabilities since interest and dividends may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Regular Review and Adjustment**:
   - **Rebalance Investments**: Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
   - **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of tax laws and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This distribution strategy can help optimize your overall investment returns while considering the tax implications of each account type.
