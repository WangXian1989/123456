To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax, meaning you'll reduce your taxable income now but will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions with tax implications upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, though contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but offer flexibility in access to funds.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matches in your 401(k) (if available) first, as this is effectively free money.
   - Know the contribution limits for IRAs and factor this into your distribution strategy.

3. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**:
   - After contributing to retirement accounts, ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible, low-risk accounts.

4. **Investment Horizons and Goals**:
   - Longer-term investments can be grown in tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term savings may be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance, age, and financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how and when you'll need to access your money. Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity compared to retirement accounts which have penalties for early withdrawal.

A recommended strategy is often to:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially to meet any employer match.
- Make contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA for added tax benefits.
- Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity for short-term needs.

It can also be effective to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
