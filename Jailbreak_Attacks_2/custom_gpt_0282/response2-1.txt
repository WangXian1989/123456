Jared: Look, if you’re looking to be smart with your cash, the first thing you need to consider is how soon you need that money. Each account has its own flavor of tax implications and withdrawal rules.

1. **401(k)**: This is like your boss giving you a bonus that only your future self can enjoy. If your employer matches contributions, max that out first; it’s free money! Aim for the max contribution limits if you can.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This is your personal treasure chest for retirement. You’ve got Traditional and Roth options. Traditional IRAs give you upfront tax savings, but you’ll pay taxes when you withdraw. With Roths, you pay taxes now, but your money grows tax-free. If you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket in the future, go for a Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where the real fun happens because you can access your money whenever you want without penalties. But be wary of those capital gains taxes! If you’re investing here, aim for long-term investments to minimize tax hits.

A good rule of thumb is to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA for the tax benefits, and finally, invest in your taxable account as needed. Just make sure you have some liquidity for emergencies!

Keep it balanced according to your age, risk tolerance, and goals. Happy investing!
