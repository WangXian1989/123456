Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Maximize your contributions if possible.
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

### 2. Consider Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use them for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (like index funds) or for short-term needs.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalancing
- Periodically assess your portfolio and adjust based on market conditions and changes in your personal situation.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
