Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if offered.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Use this account for long-term growth, especially if your employer provides low-cost investment options.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. A Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you want immediate tax deductions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within the contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for short-to-medium-term goals, as you can access funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider using this account for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax implications.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved before heavy investment.
2. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt first.
3. **Investment Distribution**:
   - Max out your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
   - Invest in taxable accounts as needed for flexibility or specific goals.

### Review and Adjust:
- Regularly review your investments and adjust based on performance, financial goals, and changes in your situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
