Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax efficiency and growth. Here are some strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out employer match first.
   - Contribute as much as possible, especially if you have a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Use a traditional IRA for tax deductions if eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs.
   - Prioritize investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.
2. **401(k)**: Aim for 15-20% of your income, maxing out if possible.
3. **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit ($6,500 for 2023, $7,500 if over 50).
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Reassessment
- Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### Consider Professional Advice
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
