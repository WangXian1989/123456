To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute the maximum to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: These allow for pre-tax contributions, reducing your current taxable income. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for more than a year.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term investments, focusing on growth-oriented assets.
   - Keep more stable, liquid investments in taxable accounts to provide easy access when needed.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diverse investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and aligns with your financial goals. For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.
