To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA can offer immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age. Target-date funds can simplify this process.
   - **IRA**: Use this account for high-growth investments since withdrawals can be tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that yield capital gains and qualified dividends for favorable tax treatment.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies since they offer easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Maintain your desired asset allocation by periodically rebalancing to adjust for market fluctuations.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize growth while managing tax implications over time. Tailor your strategy to your financial goals and timeline.
