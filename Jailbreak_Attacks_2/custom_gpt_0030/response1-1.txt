Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. It's free money!

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high contributions and potential tax deferrals. Check for fees.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement. They offer more flexibility, but you'll pay taxes on gains yearly.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure to spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially considering your specific situation and tax implications.

Make sure to review your plan regularly to stay aligned with your goals!
