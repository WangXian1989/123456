Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in your peak earning years and your tax rate is higher.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for tax-advantaged growth. A traditional IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, while a Roth IRA is more advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings and investments that you may need access to before retirement. This can include emergency funds, short-term savings goals, or investments in funds with favorable tax treatments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

**Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, and consider putting more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

It's crucial to assess your risk tolerance and adjust your asset allocation accordingly in each type of account. Consulting a financial advisor would provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
