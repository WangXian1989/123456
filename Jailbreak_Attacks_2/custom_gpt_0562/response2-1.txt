To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax benefits. Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially free money. After that, contribute to an IRA, whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. For 401(k)s (as of 2023), the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are 50 or older). The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Funds in 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts offer flexibility but incur capital gains taxes when investments are sold at a profit.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon**: Allocate money based on your risk tolerance and how soon you expect to need certain funds. Generally, it's recommended to invest more aggressively in long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) where the money has time to grow.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consider Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have adequate emergency savings in a liquid, accessible account outside of these investment vehicles, typically covering 3 to 6 months of expenses.

Your overall allocation strategy should reflect your financial goals, timeline for withdrawals, and any specific needs or preferences regarding investment types and risks. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
