When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement, making them a favorable option if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront, which can be beneficial if you need immediate tax relief.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing any employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if it has low fees and a good range of investment options.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals. Focus on investments that generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Balanced Investment Approach**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, you can invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature and potential tax benefits.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your unique circumstances and help you optimize your investment strategy.
