When deciding how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Prioritize contributions to these accounts if your employer matches 401(k) contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high short-term capital gains or interest income, which are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, while being aware of annual limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term growth is better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more liquid, shorter-term goals are better for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Depending on your expected retirement age and income needs, consider which accounts to draw from first. Generally, you would withdraw from your taxable accounts before tapping into tax-deferred accounts to allow those accounts to continue growing.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Ultimately, consult with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
