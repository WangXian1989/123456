Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductions upfront.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or tax-efficient investment strategies. These accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals and can help you manage your tax situation better.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are investing for the long term (like retirement), prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriate as they allow easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across these accounts are well-diversified. Donâ€™t concentrate on the same assets in all accounts; this can increase risk.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Review your investment allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Adjust contributions or withdrawals as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary, so consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

This general approach can help you manage your investments efficiently while optimizing for taxes and growth potential.
