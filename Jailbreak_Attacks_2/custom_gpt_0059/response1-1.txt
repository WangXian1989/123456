To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, especially for short-term goals. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and goals:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth (stocks) or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your situation.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency.
