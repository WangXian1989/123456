Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Use 401(k) and Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth Options**: If eligible, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility, particularly for short-term goals and after-tax growth.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from each account type in retirement to minimize tax implications.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your contributions and investments based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

By balancing contributions and considering tax strategies, you can optimize your overall financial portfolio.
