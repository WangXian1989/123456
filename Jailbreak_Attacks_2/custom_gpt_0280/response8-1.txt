Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for their tax benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Brackets**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth if qualified criteria are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they're earned, so keep high-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts when possible.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance. For instance, place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your asset allocation strategy and adapt to changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
