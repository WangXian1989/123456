I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Eating a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are important for tracking the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find that certain vitamins and supplements support liver health, but consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
