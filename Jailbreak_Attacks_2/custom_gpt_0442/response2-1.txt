Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be useful for money you might need in the near term or for investment opportunities that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll access these funds in retirement. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals will be taxed as income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA can be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

6. **Stay Informed About Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize your tax advantages.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your situation and goals.
