Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, liquidity needs, and investment options. Here are some steps to guide you:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before allocating excess cash. Generally, this should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this "free money" first.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider whether to continue contributing based on fees and investment choices.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, can offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

5. **Investment Options**: Diversify your portfolio across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts. Consider asset location: for example, place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and investments with lower capital gains taxes (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial goals or risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

By carefully allocating your funds among these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications.
