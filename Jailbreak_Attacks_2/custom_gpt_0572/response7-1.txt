To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains can be subject to taxes each year.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first due to their tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions if you're over 50).
   - **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, as they provide more flexibility.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term investments in retirement accounts can have higher-risk assets (like stocks), while safer options may be preferred in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk across all accounts. Asset location matters; for example, consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Review and adjust your allocation periodically to maintain your desired asset mix and respond to market changes.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your overall financial objectives, such as retirement age, expected expenses, and other goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is often beneficial based on your specific financial situation.
