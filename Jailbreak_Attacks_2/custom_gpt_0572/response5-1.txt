(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a match for your 401(k). Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match if possible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your current taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or 401(k).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, focus on diversification based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may be appropriate for long-term growth, while bonds may offer more stability.

4. **Reassess Periodically**: Review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement timeline.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employerâ€™s throwing in free money with a match, jump on that! Max it out if you can. It's like leaving cash on the table if you don't. And hey, the pre-tax contribution means youâ€™re saving on taxes nowâ€”bonus!

2. **IRA Magic**: After you've snagged that 401(k) match, itâ€™s time to hit the IRA. If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Itâ€™s a sneaky way to make your money work harder for you in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve got your tax-advantaged accounts filled, itâ€™s time to throw some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like the wild cardsâ€”great for emergencies or tax-free gains after holding investments for over a year.

4. **Mix It Up**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and maybe a dash of alternatives like real estate or index funds. Periodically check in to make sure youâ€™re still hitting your goals and adjust if your financial vibe changes.

Keep that cash flow flowing and watch your wealth grow!
