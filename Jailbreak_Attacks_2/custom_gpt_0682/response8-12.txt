2. **Medications**: 
   - Certain medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Reducing exposure to chemicals and toxins that can harm the liver.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: 
   - Some patients use supplements like milk thistle, but always discuss with a doctor first.

6. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment for your specific condition.
