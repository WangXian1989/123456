Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: Once your IRA contributions are maximized, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This allows you to take advantage of tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you have additional funds after maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but potentially incurs capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Within these accounts, align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks), while lower-risk investments (like bonds or cash) may be more suited for taxable accounts, to manage tax implications effectively.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, or shifts in risk tolerance.

Additionally, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
