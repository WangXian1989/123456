Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50).

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a Traditional IRA (and 401(k)) may lower your taxable income now, while Roth contributions (for both IRA and 401(k)) allow for tax-free growth, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider using your taxable account for more liquid investments or those with potentially higher tax implications (like bonds and high-yield stocks) due to capital gains tax.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - At retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

6. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, the performance of your investments, and any changes in tax laws.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies that align with your long-term goals and tax considerations.

Implementing these steps can help you optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
