Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth) as it offers tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Continue Contributions**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k) and contributing to an IRA, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if you have additional funds to invest, you can allocate money to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. These are useful for reaching goals with shorter time horizons.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Pay attention to your tax situation. Funds in taxable accounts may incur capital gains tax when sold, while tax-advantaged accounts can help mitigate that.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your overall investment strategy across all accounts, considering risks and the time until you need the funds.

7. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.
