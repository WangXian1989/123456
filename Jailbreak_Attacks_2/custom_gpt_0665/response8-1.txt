To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you can.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and eligibility).

2. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal. Aim for this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) can be beneficial, as withdrawals (if qualified) are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for funds you may need before retirement. Also, consider holding long-term investments here to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Diversify within each account according to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.
   - Typically, higher-risk investments like stocks can be favored in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your investment allocations and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary.

6. **Consult a Financial Planner**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor your strategy based on your individual circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

By focusing on tax efficiency and balancing contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your investment strategy for better long-term growth.
