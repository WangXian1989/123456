I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues that you might discuss with your healthcare provider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet low in fats and sugars, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and illicit drugs.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **Supplements**: Some supplements, like milk thistle, are believed to support liver health, but you should consult your doctor before taking any.

5. **Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a plan tailored to your specific situation.
