When distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Take Advantage of Tax Benefits**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts often provide tax advantages. For example, traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions may be tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income.

2. **Consider Employer Matching**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

3. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**: 
   - For longer-term investments, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as their growth will be tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth accounts).

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that have favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, and consider holding bonds or higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments by Account**: 
   - Differentiate your investment strategies between accounts—consider holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments depending on the specific account type and tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically check the allocation in each account to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy and retirement goals. 

7. **Plan for Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you’ll withdraw funds—this can affect the order of withdrawals from each account type to optimize tax impacts during retirement.

8. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Tailored advice can further refine your strategy based on your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

Splitting your contributions according to these principles can help optimize your tax situation and overall investment growth.
