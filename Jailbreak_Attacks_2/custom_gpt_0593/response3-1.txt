To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the contribution year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals will be taxed as income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but you pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - If you're saving for retirement, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k).
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term investments or if you need more access to your funds without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is typically $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). Max out contributions up to the employer match in your 401(k) before allocating funds elsewhere.

4. **Investment Options**:
   - Compare the investment options available in your 401(k) plan versus those available in an IRA or taxable account. If the 401(k) has high fees or limited options, you might prefer contributing to an IRA.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. If you think you might need access to your money before retirement, taxable accounts offer the greatest flexibility.

**Recommended Strategy**:
1. Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if using a Roth IRA.
3. After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

Consulting with a financial adviser can tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
