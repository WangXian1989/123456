I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. However, common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like dieting, exercise, and limiting alcohol consumption, as well as medications to manage underlying causes. In some severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary. Always seek personalized advice from a medical professional tailored to your specific condition.
