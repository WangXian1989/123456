3. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create interactive content, like polls and quizzes, to engage them and encourage participation.

4. **Peer Networks**: Involve young leaders and organizations that can mobilize their peers, making outreach feel more personal and relatable.

5. **Events and Experiences**: Host events, workshops, and concerts to create a sense of community and encourage civic participation.

By focusing on these approaches, campaigns can effectively connect with and mobilize young voters.
