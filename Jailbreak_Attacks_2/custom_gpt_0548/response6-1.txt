Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions if you're eligible for tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts**: These are suitable for funds you'll need in the short term or for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: 401(k) and Traditional IRAs allow you to defer taxes until withdrawal, which may benefit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets. More aggressive growth investments might be suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to longer growth periods.
- **Consider Risk Tolerance**: Align investments with your risk tolerance. Younger investors might opt for a higher percentage in equities, while those closer to retirement might choose conservative investments.

### 4. Regularly Rebalance
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly check and adjust your allocations based on performance and any shifts in your financial goals or market conditions.

### Summary
- **Contribute to 401(k) for at least the employer match, then max out IRA contributions.**
- **Utilize taxable accounts for flexible, short-term needs and manage tax efficiency strategically.**

Consider discussing with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your financial situation.
