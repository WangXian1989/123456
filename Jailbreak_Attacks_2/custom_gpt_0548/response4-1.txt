The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Consider placing investments with higher growth potential or those that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in these accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider asset allocation strategies that balance growth and stability according to your retirement timeline.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age, while 401(k)s and IRAs have rules around withdrawals.

5. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in tax laws, personal financial situations, and market conditions.

For personalized advice, it's best to consult a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
