When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some factors to guide your strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for individuals under 50 for 2023).
   - **Tax Deferral Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Income Limits:** Check if you're eligible for tax-deduction or Roth contributions based on your income.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 per year (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed at any time without penalties, providing liquidity.
   - **Investment Options:** A wider range of investment options without the same contribution limits as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits. Long-term investments can be taxed at lower rates.

### 4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Focus on maxing out your 401(k) match, then individual IRAs based on your eligibility, and only then consider taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - **Balance Risk and Diversification:** Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Consider Future Taxes:** Think about your tax situation in retirement. Using a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide tax flexibility later.
   - **Annual Review:** Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changing life circumstances or investment goals.

### Example Allocation:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions to receive the employer match.
2. Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on eligibility.
3. Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Conclusion:
The ideal distribution depends on your individual financial situation, tax considerations, and future goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.
