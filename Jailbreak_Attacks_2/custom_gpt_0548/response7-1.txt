Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Emergency Fund First**: Before allocating to retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this incentive before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: If you havenâ€™t reached the employer match limit, continue contributing here. 
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax bracket and anticipated future tax rates. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for investments. These accounts offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though they come with tax obligations for any capital gains or income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors can afford a riskier portfolio, while those closer to retirement may benefit from more conservative investments.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy regularly as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
