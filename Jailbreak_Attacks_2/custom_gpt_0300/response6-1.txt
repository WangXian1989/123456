To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Prioritize this to benefit from free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, index funds).
   - **Short-Term**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for liquidity and investment flexibility.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Asset Location**: Hold high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-bearing assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) in each account type to manage risk effectively.

Assess your current financial situation and adjust based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
