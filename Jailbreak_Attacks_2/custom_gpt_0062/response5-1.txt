To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k). This reduces taxable income and grows tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments you might need to access sooner.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Be mindful of the fees associated with each account type, as high fees can erode returns over time.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your situation.

This strategy balances growth potential with tax advantages and liquidity, optimizing your overall financial picture.
