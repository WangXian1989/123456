To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or mutual funds, as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on the tax implications of each account in retirement. For instance, Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals, while 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Always keep sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies and short-term needs.

By distributing your money this way, you'll optimize tax efficiency and grow your retirement savings effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
