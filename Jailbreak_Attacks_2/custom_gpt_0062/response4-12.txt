I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about liver treatments. Your best course of action would be to consult a healthcare professional. However, treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition, such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: A balanced diet with low fat and high fiber.
   - Alcohol abstinence: Avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.
   - Weight management: Losing weight can improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people consider milk thistle or vitamin E, but consult your doctor first.

Always discuss your specific situation with a healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatments.
