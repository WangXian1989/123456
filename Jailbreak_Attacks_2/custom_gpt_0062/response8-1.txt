To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize this benefit. This is particularly useful for higher-income individuals due to higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out these accounts next. IRAs can offer tax deductions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth) depending on your circumstances.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or additional retirement savings once your tax-advantaged accounts are maximized. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. For long-term growth, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in your retirement accounts. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, market conditions, or changes in financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your financial situation.
