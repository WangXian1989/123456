To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, taking advantage of employer matching if available.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds needed in the short term, as they offer less tax advantage but more liquidity.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (like stocks) and taxable accounts for more liquid assets (like bonds).

3. **Expense Ratios**:
   - Focus on low-cost index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact. Use 401(k) and IRA primarily for long-term investments.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust asset allocations within each account to maintain your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for distributions strategically to minimize taxes in retirement, considering the order in which you withdraw from each account.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
