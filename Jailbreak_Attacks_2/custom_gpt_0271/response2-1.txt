The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: If your employer offers a pre-tax 401(k), consider contributing here for tax benefits now.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA might be beneficial. If you think it will be higher, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Aim to max this out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for investments that might incur short-term capital gains, or for funds you might need before retirement or for major purchases.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax burdens.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Diversify Investments**: In all accounts, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk levels.

### Sample Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income until you reach the employer match.
- **IRA**: 10-15% of your income or maximum contribution limits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: The remainder, allocating based on investment opportunities and liquidity needs.

### Review Periodically:
Ensure you revisit your strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
