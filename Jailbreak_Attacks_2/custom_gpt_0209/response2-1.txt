Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute beyond the match limit if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions in the contribution year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: If you need funds in the short term, keep a portion in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) and strategies to minimize taxes on gains.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
