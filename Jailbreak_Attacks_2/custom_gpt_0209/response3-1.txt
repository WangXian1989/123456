Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the max limit if you can. Consider a traditional 401(k) for pre-tax contributions or a Roth 401(k) for post-tax.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in your taxable accounts. This gives you more access to funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: 
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts as they may benefit from lower tax rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely, so seeking professional advice tailored to your situation can be invaluable.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy across different account types effectively.
