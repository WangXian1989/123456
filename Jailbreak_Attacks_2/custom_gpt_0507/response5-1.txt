(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to focus on maximizing employer matches in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider funding your IRA to benefit from potential tax advantages. Once you've made the most of these tax-advantaged accounts, you can distribute further investments into taxable accounts as needed. Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific situation.
