The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start for your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and try to max out your contributions if possible. The contribution limit is higher than that of IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They provide flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts due to tax implications on capital gains.

6. **Balance and Reassess**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your personal financial situation or goals. 

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique circumstances.

Be sure to consider your individual financial situation as you make these decisions!
