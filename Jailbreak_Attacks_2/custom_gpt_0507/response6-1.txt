To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate the highest tax liabilities, such as bonds or high dividend stocks. 
   - Use your taxable account for investments that favor long-term capital gains, such as stocks held for more than a year.

2. **Contribution Limits and Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to qualify for employer matching, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize your IRA contributions (if eligible) following the current limits, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Balance Risk and Return:**
   - Diversify your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance, ensuring a mix of equities, fixed income, and other investment vehicles across all accounts.
   - Regularly re-evaluate your allocation based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes: withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts like a Roth IRA if available.

By understanding and implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage your money across various accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
