I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, common treatment options include:

1. **Medications**: Antivirals for hepatitis, anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.
4. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like endoscopy for varices or even liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
