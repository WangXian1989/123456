Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (e.g., stocks with high dividends) or for money you may need in the short term.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your investment choices (stocks, bonds, ETFs) are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and opportunity.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically check your asset allocation and adjust to maintain your desired risk level based on market changes or life events.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type when planning for retirement.
