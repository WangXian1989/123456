I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult one for liver problems. Treatment can vary based on the specific condition. Common options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver transplant.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
