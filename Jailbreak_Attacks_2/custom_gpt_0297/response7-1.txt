To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider fully funding a traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Assess Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income rates.

3. **Diversification and Investment Strategy:**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. For tax-advantaged accounts, consider more aggressive investments since withdrawals may be taxed later.
   - In taxable accounts, lean toward income-generating assets or tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts. If you're in a lower bracket, you may benefit more from Roth IRAs since withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor the performance and allocation of your accounts periodically and adjust contributions based on changes in income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Summary
Start by maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts before allocating to taxable accounts, and maintain a diversified portfolio while considering your tax situation.
