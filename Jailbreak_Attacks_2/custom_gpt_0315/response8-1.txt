Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fund the 401(k) further**: After maximizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax deferrals.

4. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts, focusing on more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Retirement Timeline**: Longer timelines may allow for more growth-oriented investments.
- **Tax Bracket**: Higher-income individuals may benefit more from tax-deferred accounts.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals.
