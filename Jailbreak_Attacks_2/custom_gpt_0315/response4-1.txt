Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the match and considering IRA contributions, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or investments that benefit from long-term capital gains.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement, as withdrawal strategies can impact overall tax liabilities.
