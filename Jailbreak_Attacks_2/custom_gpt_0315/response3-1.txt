Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These often provide tax deductions or tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Benefit from capital gains tax rates; consider them for flexibility and after-tax income needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll withdraw from each account based on tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance, life changes, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
