Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before taxable accounts. These accounts can provide tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible for a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, consider contributing the maximum allowed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account types. This helps manage risk.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Taxable accounts should generally hold investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs, since you'll owe capital gains taxes on profits when you sell.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your future withdrawal needs. The order of withdrawals can be crucial for tax efficiency in retirement.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Professional**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so it's essential to consider your entire financial picture.
