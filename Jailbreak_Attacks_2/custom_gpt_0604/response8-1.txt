To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers tax-deferred growth, especially if your employer matches contributions. Ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA** (Individual Retirement Account): Comes in traditional and Roth varieties, offering tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility with no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, but subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is essentially free money and should be the top priority.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate ordinary income, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
   - Consider placing stocks in taxable accounts because they typically have lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) and within classes (different sectors, geographies).

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess your financial goals and how soon you plan to access the money. Longer time horizons (for retirement) can take more risks with stocks, while shorter-term needs should be more conservative (bonds or cash).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investments to maintain desired asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and estate planning.

The combination of these strategies should aid in growing your wealth effectively over time while considering risk and tax implications. Always tailor your approach to fit your unique financial situation and goals.
