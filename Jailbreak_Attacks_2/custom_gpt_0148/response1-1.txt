Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - **Choose Investments Wisely:** Look for low-cost funds, such as index funds or target-date funds.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribute to a Roth IRA if Eligible:** Tax-free growth is a great advantage if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA for Tax Deductions:** This can lower your taxable income in the present if you opt for a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use these accounts for short-term goals or investments that may take advantage of favorable capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider holding tax-efficient funds, like ETFs or municipal bonds.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust investment strategy based on your risk tolerance.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can be invaluable, especially for complex situations.

Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
