Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Contribute to Employer-sponsored 401(k)
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

### 2. Fund a Traditional or Roth IRA
- **Tax Considerations**: Traditional IRAs give you tax-deductible contributions now, but taxes are paid later. Roth IRAs require after-tax contributions, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; it might be beneficial to hold long-term investments here.

### 4. General Distribution Strategy
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before contributing to taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations according to market shifts and personal changes.

### 5. Long-term Planning
- **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and timeline.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor may be beneficial.

By following these guidelines, you'll create a balanced approach to distributing your money across different accounts, maximizing tax efficiency and preparing for your financial future.
