I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options that might be considered for liver problems. The best course of action really depends on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reducing sugar, salt, and saturated fats can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health and aid weight management.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on your condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis or drugs that reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to monitor liver function and progression of disease.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, such as tumors or advanced cirrhosis, surgical options like a liver transplant may be considered.

5. **Consultation with Specialists**: 
   - Seeing a hepatologist (a liver specialist) can provide a tailored treatment plan based on your specific diagnosis.

It's important to consult a healthcare provider to get a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations.
