Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, with taxes due on withdrawals.
     - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them suitable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
  
3. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across these accounts to balance risk. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage volatility.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to reduce capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds and high-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield interest income from immediate taxation.

5. **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth while being mindful of withdrawal rules and penalties.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for later years.

7. **Regular Re-evaluation**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
