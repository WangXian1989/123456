I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems based on your condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and make necessary adjustments to treatment.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures to remove blockages or even liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: This includes managing symptoms and complications, often with the help of a healthcare team.

Please consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
