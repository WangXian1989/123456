Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. The tax-free withdrawals in retirement can be advantageous, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing the match, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This helps reduce your taxable income.

4. **Fund Traditional IRA**: If you have extra funds, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for additional tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate significant income (like bonds) or if you need flexibility for future withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review Periodically**: Regularly assess your allocations based on market performance, life changes, or shifts in your financial goals.
