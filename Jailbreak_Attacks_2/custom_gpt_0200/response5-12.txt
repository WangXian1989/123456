I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that people might consider for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests help track the progress of your condition.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances like certain medications or chemicals can help protect your liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options, including liver transplants, may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
