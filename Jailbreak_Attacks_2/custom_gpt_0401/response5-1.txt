The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, it's often a good idea to contribute enough to get any employer match since it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you're in a high-tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later. A Traditional IRA may be better if you want to reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (such as 401(k)s and IRAs), consider putting extra savings in a taxable investment account. This provides accessibility and flexibility for non-retirement needs while allowing for investment growth.

**Considerations**:
- Prioritize accounts with employer matching and tax advantages first.
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategy for each account type.
- Review tax implications of withdrawals in retirement to create a tax-efficient strategy.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
