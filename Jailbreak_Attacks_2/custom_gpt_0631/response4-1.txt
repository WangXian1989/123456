When considering the distribution of your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors such as tax implications, your financial goals, investment strategy, and timeline. Here are some strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they provide tax advantages. Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're aged 50 or older), while for IRAs, itâ€™s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, traditional accounts (401(k) and IRA) may be beneficial due to tax deferral. Conversely, if you're currently in a lower tax bracket, consider Roth accounts where you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

5. **Review Your Cash Needs**: Keep in mind your liquidity needs. Taxable accounts can provide easy access to funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts that may impose penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of investment and tax strategies, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.
