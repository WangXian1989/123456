To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money. If you're able, aim to max out your contributions, especially if your 401(k) offers a pre-tax option.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions.
   
2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts are suitable for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualify for long-term capital gains rates. Consider holding investments with high turnover in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and returns. Ensure each account has a strategy aligned with your overall financial goals.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, ensuring that you have accessible funds for unexpected expenses.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This may involve shifting funds between accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Consider your investment horizon and retirement timeline. For long-term investments, you may lean towards more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you feel overwhelmed, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Remember, the appropriate distribution can depend on your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Make adjustments as necessary to align with life changes and market conditions.
