Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, continue increasing contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments after hitting the above limits. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure that all accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For instance, place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-paying securities in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
