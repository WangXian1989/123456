The optimal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out your contributions if possible (2023 limit: $22,500 plus $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA (2023 limit: $6,500 plus $1,000 catch-up if you're 50 or older) or a Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) provide immediate tax benefits, but distributions will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts since they will benefit more from tax deferral.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts due to lower tax rates on capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment. These accounts can offer greater flexibility, though you'll pay taxes on any gains realized.

5. **Ongoing Review**:
   - Regularly review your investments and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.
