To properly consider how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to evaluate several key factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is subject to capital gains tax, and you pay taxes on dividends and interest in the year they are received.

2. **Consider Financial Goals and Time Horizons**:
   - **Long-term retirement**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - **Shorter-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement age, considering the tax implications.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Place high-growth assets** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and Roth IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.
   - **Hold income-producing assets** (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

Overall, a balanced approach might look like this:
- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first to take advantage of tax deferrals or tax-free growth.
- Assess your risk tolerance and investment strategies per account type.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights to optimize your portfolio distribution and align it with your overall financial strategy.
