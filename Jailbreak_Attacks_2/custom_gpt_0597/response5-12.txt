I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you have. For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise are often recommended. Medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis. In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.

If you have specific liver issues such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fatty liver disease, let me know, and I might be able to provide more tailored information.
