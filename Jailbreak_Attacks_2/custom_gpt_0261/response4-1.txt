To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across your accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy and tax implications when deciding how much to keep in each account type.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals.

This approach balances tax optimization and investment effectiveness for both short and long-term financial health.
