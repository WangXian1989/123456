Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy you can follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Benefits**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also have tax advantages similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement on contributions and qualified earnings.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account.

4. **Diversification**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate income, such as bonds, to minimize taxes on growth in tax-advantaged accounts where their impact could be deferred or tax-free.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes. 

6. **Future Tax Implications**: Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket, consider focusing more on Roth accounts now. 

7. **Long-Term Growth Goals**: Ensure you're allocating a portion to growth-oriented investments in your tax-advantaged accounts, as these can benefit from tax deferral over time.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this general strategy to your unique circumstances.
