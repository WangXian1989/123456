I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. That said, common treatment options for liver issues typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars. Foods rich in antioxidants may help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medication**: 
   - Depending on the underlying condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or address specific liver diseases, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver recovery.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help track liver function.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider for the most suitable treatment for your situation.
