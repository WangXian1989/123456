To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer's 401(k) Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: After your 401(k) match, aim to max out contributions to your IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require access before retirement (like saving for a home or other short-term goals).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, balance your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). Typically, the more aggressive investments can go into tax-deferred or exempt accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investments and adjust allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Fees and Taxes**: Look at the fees associated with each account type and consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each in the future.

Always tailor your strategy based on your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
