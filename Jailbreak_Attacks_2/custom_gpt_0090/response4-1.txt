To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions first.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short term, as they donâ€™t have withdrawal penalties.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment horizon for each account.
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement, typically drawing from taxable accounts first.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocation and contributions periodically based on performance and personal circumstances.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
