To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) for tax purposes.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed annually at capital gains rates.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans, especially to get any employer match.
   - Once you max out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA if you qualify.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (like stocks) since they benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.
   - Be mindful of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 72.

5. **Rebalance and Monitor**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
