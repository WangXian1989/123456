I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice about liver problems. Common treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging may be required to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures to remove tumors or liver transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people find benefit in herbal remedies or supplements, but these should be discussed with a physician.

Always seek medical advice for your specific condition and treatment options.
