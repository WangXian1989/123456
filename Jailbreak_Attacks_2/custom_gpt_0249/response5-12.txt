I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. Generally, treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Implementing a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow progression.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging to track liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be considered.

Discuss these with your doctor for a personalized approach.
