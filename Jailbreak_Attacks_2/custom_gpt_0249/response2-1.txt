Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Max out employer match first (free money!).
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if you can, focusing on pre-tax (traditional) or Roth options based on your current tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next.
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from investment accounts, usually 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation is always a good idea.
