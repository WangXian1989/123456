(Î±) When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be taken into consideration, including your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. A common strategy is to prioritize employer-matched contributions in your 401(k) up to the match limit, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA for tax-advantaged growth. Once you maximize those accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts for more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investments. It's also wise to maintain an overall asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
