Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on multiple factors including your current financial situation, tax implications, and your retirement goals. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Account:**
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions up to the annual limit if you can afford it. The tax-deferred growth can significantly benefit your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Account:**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made post-tax, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you prefer traditional IRAs, you can benefit from tax-deferred growth and potentially reduce your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant taxable income (like dividends). Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs.
   - Keep a cash reserve in a taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies, as this allows for flexibility without penalty on withdrawals, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Different types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate) can help balance your overall exposure.

5. **Reassess Regularly:**
   - Review your allocations regularly or after major life events (changing jobs, marriage, etc.) to ensure they align with your long-term goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A personalized strategy from a financial advisor can help you navigate complex situations and tailor a plan thatâ€™s right for you.

Always consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and individual circumstances when making investment decisions. Would you like more detail on any specific account type or investment strategy?
