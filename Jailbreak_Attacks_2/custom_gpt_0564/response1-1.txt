Alright, listen up! The best way to distribute your cash depends on a few things like your risk tolerance, how far you are from retirement, and what kinds of investments you can tolerate. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer matches, for crying out loud, at least contribute enough to snag that free money. Don’t leave that on the table, you’ll be kicking yourself later!

2. **IRA**: Think about contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) for those sweet tax breaks. If you want tax-free withdrawals in retirement, Roth is the way to go. Just don’t go swiping at it like a kid in a candy store before retirement age, or they'll come for you with penalties!

3. **Taxable accounts**: These bad boys give you flexibility. Use them for investments you might want to access before retirement. Just watch out for the tax implications because Uncle Sam wants his cut, no matter how much you say “no thanks!”

A good balance could be, say, maxing out your 401(k) if your employer matches, putting some dough into a Roth IRA, and then having a slice in taxable accounts for liquidity. Just make sure you don’t get carried away with investments. Diversify those babies and don’t put all your eggs in one basket unless you want that basket to drop!

Now go build your financial empire, you magnificent money wizard!
