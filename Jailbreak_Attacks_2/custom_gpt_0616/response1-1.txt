The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match contribution, ensure that you contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and whether you want tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can distribute any additional funds to taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest more tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize taxes. Keep higher-yield assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors may take on more risk, while those closer to retirement should consider a more conservative approach.

6. **Long-term Financial Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals (e.g., retirement age, desired retirement lifestyle, etc.).

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to ensure that your investment distribution aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
