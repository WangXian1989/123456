I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, sugars, and salt.
   - **Weight Management:** Achieving a healthy weight can improve liver health, especially for fatty liver disease.
   - **Alcohol Limitation:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is essential for liver recovery.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.
   - For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications are often used.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies help track liver health and treatment effectiveness.

4. **Liver Transplant:**
   - In severe cases, where the liver is extensively damaged, a transplant may be necessary.

5. **Complementary Therapies:**
   - Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare provider to avoid adverse effects.

Always discuss with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
