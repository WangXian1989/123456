Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - If eligible, prioritize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for its tax advantages.
   - A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - Consider the tax impact; traditional contributions lower current taxable income, while Roth contributions are taxed now but grow tax-free.

### 4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement age.
   - Consider keeping investments in taxable accounts that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or long-term capital gains investments.

### 5. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and when you plan to access the funds.
   - Younger investors might lean heavier on stocks, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach typically involves taking full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by taxable accounts for additional needs. It’s beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
