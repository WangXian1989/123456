I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Here are common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants might be necessary.

5. **Alternatives**: Some explore herbal remedies, but consult with a healthcare provider before trying them.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
