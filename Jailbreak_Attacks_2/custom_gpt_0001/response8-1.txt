To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowed, especially if your income is high. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate short-term gains or for goals within the next 3-5 years. 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as needed.

6. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Get personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax impacts.
