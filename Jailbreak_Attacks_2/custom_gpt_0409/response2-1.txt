Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, so prioritize maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider whether a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth) or a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, tax-deferred growth) is more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and aim not to exceed them.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a well-diversified portfolio across all account types, including stocks, bonds, and other assets, to manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances can vary greatly; consider consulting a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that meets your specific needs and goals.

Ultimately, balancing contributions based on tax benefits, employer matches, and your financial goals will help in effectively distributing your money across these accounts.
