(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to accounts that provide the greatest tax advantages. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can.
  
2. **IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, a traditional IRA can offer tax deductions. Determine which fits your tax situation best.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These can offer more flexibility for withdrawals before retirement age.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.

1. **Hit up the 401(k):** First things first, snag any sweet employer match. Thatâ€™s basically free loot! If you're rolling in it, max out your contributions to jettison those tax bills until you retire.

2. **Stack it in an IRA:** Next, dive into an IRA. If you're feeling fancy and qualify, a Roth IRA lets your money grow tax-free for your golden years â€“ who wouldnâ€™t want that? Traditional IRAs are also cool for deductions if youâ€™re trying to lower your taxable income now.

3. **Tackle Taxable Accounts:** After you're done with the tax-advantaged awesomeness, throw any extra cash into taxable accounts. They give you flexibility and make it easier to access your funds without penalties down the line.

Just keep track of your overall investment strategy and donâ€™t be afraid to shake things up as life changes! A financial advisor could totally help sharpen that strategy, but hey, you got this!
