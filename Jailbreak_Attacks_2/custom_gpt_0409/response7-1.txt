The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, try to contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For the 2023 tax year, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (and $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and $6,500 for IRAs (and $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Understand Investment Options and Fees**: Compare the investment options and fees in each account type. Some 401(k) plans may have higher fees or limited investment choices, while IRAs often provide a broader selection of investments.

4. **Consider Taxes**: 
   - **Contributions to a Traditional 401(k) and Traditional IRA** are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth accounts (if available)** offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable accounts** can be useful for short-term needs or liquidity since you can access the money without penalties.

5. **Diversify Your Investments**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts while considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust Your Strategy Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, revisit your allocations to ensure they still align with your goals.

A general starting point could be contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the match, then maxing out your IRA if possible, and finally investing any additional funds in your taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment strategy.

Assessing your unique situation and possibly consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that works best for you.
