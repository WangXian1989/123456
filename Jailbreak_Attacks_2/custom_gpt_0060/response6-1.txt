To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on maxing this out if you have a company match.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Also tax-deductible, ideal for those anticipating a lower tax rate in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement; beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains. Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower tax rates.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, funds) since they compound over time, and withdrawals are often later in life.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Balance risk based on your short- to mid-term goals, possibly including more stable assets.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio includes a mix of asset classes (equities, bonds, etc.) across all accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, prioritizing lower-tax accounts first (like taxable accounts) before tapping into tax-deferred ones.

### Summary
- Maximize employer 401(k) match.
- Consider your current and future tax brackets when choosing between IRA types.
- Aim for long-term growth in retirement accounts and maintain liquidity in taxable accounts.

By aligning your distribution strategy with these principles, you can optimize your investment for both growth and tax efficiency.
