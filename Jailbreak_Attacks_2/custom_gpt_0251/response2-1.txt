The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re not maximizing contributions, consider increasing your contributions. Focus on pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you have room in your budget, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are less tax-efficient. Consider holding investments like:
   - **Index Funds or ETFs**: These typically have lower turnover, resulting in lower capital gains and taxes.
   - **Dividends Stocks**: Qualified dividends may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: 
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Hold more stable, income-producing investments in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable tax treatment.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your strategy annually or as your financial situation changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific situation.

This approach helps optimize tax benefits while ensuring you have a diversified investment strategy.
