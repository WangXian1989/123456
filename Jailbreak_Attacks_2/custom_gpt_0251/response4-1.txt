Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional) next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable brokerage account. This provides liquidity and flexibility, especially for goals that are closer than retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may suit more conservative investors.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of where you hold different types of investments. For example, consider holding bonds and REITs in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your individual circumstance.
