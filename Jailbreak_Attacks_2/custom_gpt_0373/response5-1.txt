Distributing your money effectively between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Aim to maximize employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments you might need before retirement age. Interest and dividends are taxed, but long-term capital gains have favorable rates.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since these funds are for the long term.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or those that generate qualified dividends to benefit from favorable tax rates.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergency funds since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

4. **Age and Time Horizon**:
   - Younger investors may lean towards aggressive growth in 401(k) and IRAs. As you near retirement, consider shifting to safer investments.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types across all accounts to reduce risk. 

6. **Consultation with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

It might also be prudent to regularly review and adjust your allocation as your circumstances change.
