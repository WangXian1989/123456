Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves careful consideration of tax implications, investment goals, and overall financial strategy. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned, but capital gains can be more favorable tax-wise if held long-term.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you are saving for retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions to maximize tax advantages.
   - Use your taxable account for short-term goals or as a source for emergency funds since it offers more liquidity without withdrawal penalties.

**Strategies for Allocation**:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then focus on your IRA for additional tax benefits before filling up taxable accounts.
- Consider your current and expected future tax bracket to decide between traditional vs. Roth options.
- Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts. 

In conclusion, a strategic distribution focusing on tax efficiency and your financial goals can optimize your investment potential. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice suited to your individual circumstances.
