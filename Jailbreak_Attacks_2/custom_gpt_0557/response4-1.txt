When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and personal circumstances. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the year you contribute.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) can provide flexibility in retirement. This can help you manage your tax liability in retirement by allowing you to choose which accounts to withdraw from based on your tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you have short-term financial goals or need liquidity, taxable accounts can be suitable. They can also provide more investment flexibility without the restrictions that come with retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Diversifying your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets can help mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts.

Ultimately, the best approach will vary based on individual circumstances, including your current and expected future income, retirement goals, and tax bracket. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that's right for you.
