Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. A general approach is: 

1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Prioritize a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax bracket and future income expectations.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or for short-term needs.
