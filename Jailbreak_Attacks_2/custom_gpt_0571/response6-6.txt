To target young voters effectively:

- **Utilize Social Media**: Engage with platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat where young voters are most active.
- **Create Relatable Content**: Use memes, videos, and interactive polls to resonate with their interests and concerns.

Focusing on pivotal issues like climate change and student debt can also enhance outreach.
