Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Typically, you might consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on income limits, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts or for investments that may benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.

It's beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
