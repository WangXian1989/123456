I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on potential treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid fatty, fried, and sugary foods.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoid alcohol consumption to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
   - **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle or omega-3 fatty acids, but consult a doctor first.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor the health of your liver and adjust treatment plans as needed.
  
4. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver biopsy may be necessary to assess damage.
   - **Liver Transplant**: This may be considered for patients with end-stage liver disease.

Always seek medical advice for the best treatment tailored to your individual situation.
