When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it ultimately depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions if you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. 
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. They are great for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which can minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
- Allocate funds based on your investment horizon and risk tolerance.
- Regularly reassess your portfolio and adjust contributions as needed.

### Additional Tips:
- Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is different, so take these suggestions as a starting point and adjust according to your personal goals and needs.
