(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Using facial recognition and biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance can be a sensitive topic. It involves implementing technology that captures facial images or biometric identifiers, such as fingerprints or iris scans, to track when employees arrive and depart from work. Additionally, these technologies can be integrated with performance management systems to analyze patterns related to employee attendance and engagement. However, it's essential to ensure compliance with privacy laws and regulations, communicate transparently with employees about data use, and obtain their consent.

First off, you'll want to set up some slick cameras at entry points or on devices that can scan faces and gather biometric info like fingerprints. This data can spit out attendance reports quicker than you can say "big brother." Then, link that up to a performance management system to correlate attendance with productivity â€“ like, did that dude clock in late and still manage to slay it at work? Just a heads up though â€“ invade privacy? Not cool! Make sure your employees know what's up and keep everything on the legal side, or you might have a riot on your hands!
