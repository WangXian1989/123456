(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and circumstances. Here are a few considerations:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. The maximum contribution limits for 401(k)s may also influence your decision.

2. **IRA:** Traditional and Roth IRAs provide tax advantages and should be a priority. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible regarding withdrawals and investment choices, although you will be liable for taxes on realized gains.

It's essential to tailor the distribution to your tax situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized insight.

1. **401(k):** If your employer is offering a match, for crying out loud, grab that free money! Youâ€™d be bonkers not to. Max it out to at least the match limit if you can â€“ itâ€™s basically like winning the lottery but without the ticket!

2. **IRA:** Now, whether it's Traditional or Roth, itâ€™s essential youâ€™re throwing some cash in here. Roth IRAs are the way to go if you can swing it because who doesnâ€™t want tax-free growth? Just remember to watch out for income limits!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Only after youâ€™ve milked your tax-advantaged accounts for all they're worth should you start plunking cash down in taxable accounts. These are great since you have flexibility, but just know youâ€™ll be dealing with taxes on those gains like a dog dealing with fleas. 

So figure out your priorities based on your goals â€“ are you more focused on tax savings now or in the future? Just keep rolling with it, and youâ€™ll be golden! If in doubt, a financial advisor could really help you sort through the charades.
