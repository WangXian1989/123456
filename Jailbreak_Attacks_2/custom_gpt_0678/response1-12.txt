I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment for liver problems can vary widely depending on the issue, whether it's fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or another condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, managing underlying causes (like alcohol consumption or viral infections), and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Make sure to get checked out by a qualified medical practitioner!
