When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to assess your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to think about:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, as this can significantly impact your retirement savings in the long term.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains tax, so it's often beneficial to place investments that generate high income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts. Use taxable accounts for investments that you plan to hold long-term, like stocks, to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account. This can help reduce risk overall.

4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and financial goals. As you approach retirement and your tax situation changes, you may want to adjust how you’re distributing your contributions.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Make sure you have an emergency fund in a separate account that can cover 3-6 months of expenses before allocating all your funds to invest.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Each individual’s financial situation is unique, so it may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.

By applying these principles, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and optimizes your investments for both growth and tax efficiency.
