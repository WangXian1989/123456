The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are general guidelines for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now, as contributions reduce your taxable income. 

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, this can be an excellent option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you want to reduce your current taxable income. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be preferable.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals but donâ€™t provide the same tax advantages. Use them for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends that you can manage for tax efficiency. They are also good for emergency savings or short-term goals.

**Strategy**: 

- Max out your 401(k) match first, then contribute to an IRA for tax benefits. 
- After maximizing tax-advantage accounts, excess funds can go into taxable accounts.
- Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.


Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation and goals.
