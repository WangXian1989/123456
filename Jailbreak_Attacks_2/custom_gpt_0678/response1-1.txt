Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and that high-interest debt is under control before investing heavily.

3. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you can, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can still allocate more after funding your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). Keep in mind the tax benefits associated with these accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account. This gives you more flexibility, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts. Consider using low-cost index funds or ETFs.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed, considering changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
