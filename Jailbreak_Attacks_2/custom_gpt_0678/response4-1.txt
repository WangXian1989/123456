It's important to consider several factors when deciding how to allocate your money among different types of accounts, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. 
   - Consider maxing out contributions if it aligns with your financial goals.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - If you qualify, contribute to an IRA to enhance your retirement savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to your funds sooner.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Invest in a mix of assets across all accounts to diversify your portfolio and manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
