When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth can be more beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Fund 401(k) Up to Contribution Limits**: After maximizing the match, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to its limit for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Tailor these steps based on your specific financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
