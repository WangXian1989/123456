Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA may be better for immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments (stocks):** Place in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Income Investments (bonds):** Consider placing these in taxable accounts, as they generate interest that is usually taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Ideal for high-growth assets since you delay tax payments until withdrawal.

### 4. **Rebalancing and Withdrawals:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio.
   - Consider tax implications when withdrawing funds, especially in retirement.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can help you optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

### Key Takeaway:
Start by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), then consider contributing to an IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts based on your overall investment strategy.
