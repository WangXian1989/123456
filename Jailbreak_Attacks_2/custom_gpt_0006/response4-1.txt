When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the strategy can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach you may consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Before allocating funds to your retirement accounts, consider paying off any high-interest debt, as this can provide a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate of the debt.

3. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**:
   - If you can afford it, aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution).
   - Choose a traditional IRA for pre-tax savings or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current tax situation and income level.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable investment accounts. These offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties (though you may pay capital gains taxes).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower tax liabilities, such as index funds or long-term investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. 
   - Consider the tax implications of where you hold certain types of assets; for example, bonds can generate taxable interest and might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

This balanced approach can help you effectively manage your retirement savings and investment strategy.
