Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies you can consider:

1. **Contributions Priority**:
   - **Max out employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to capture that full match. It’s often viewed as “free money.”
   - **Retirement accounts first**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA before going back to the 401(k), primarily for their tax advantages. The traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts**: Both the 401(k) and traditional IRA allow for pre-tax contributions, which can reduce your taxable income. Investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **After-tax contributions**: If considering Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)), contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Generally use these for funds you may need before retirement (emergency funds, short-term goals). Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments (stocks) might be more suitable for accounts with long-term horizons while lower-risk (bonds, cash) might be better in more accessible accounts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Different accounts can have different investment strategies based on their purpose and tax implications.

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account in retirement to manage your tax liabilities efficiently. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from tax-free accounts.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your personal financial situation and future goals.
