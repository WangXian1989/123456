Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the IRS limit if you can afford to.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for flexibility. Invest in low-turnover funds, index funds, or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize capital gains.
   - Consider maintaining an emergency fund here too.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a liquid account.
2. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then increase to max out if possible.
3. **IRA**: Contribute fully, focusing on Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings here, focusing on long-term growth.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your allocations and adjust contributions based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.
