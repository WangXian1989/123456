Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Contribute at least enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth until you reach the maximum limit.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA can offer tax deductions now.
   - Prioritize contributions to the IRA once you’ve maximized the employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for more flexible investments or if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments here (like index funds) since capital gains taxes will apply.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - A tax professional can help you determine the best strategy based on your specific income level and future tax bracket expectations.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might lean more towards aggressive growth (stocks), whereas older investors might prioritize capital preservation.

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
