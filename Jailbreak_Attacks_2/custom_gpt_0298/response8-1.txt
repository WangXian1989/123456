To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're able, max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are useful for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a diversified mix of funds that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar focus on diversification, potentially including index funds or ETFs to reduce fees.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts for immediate needs.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

Tailoring this approach to your specific financial goals and circumstances is key. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
