To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - Once you meet the employer match in your 401(k), you can balance contributions between an IRA and the 401(k), depending on your current tax bracket and retirement goals.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate a lot of taxable income, like certain bonds or real estate, as you will pay capital gains tax on profits when sold. 

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and asset allocation strategy.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changes in tax laws, and shifts in your financial situation.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
