I’m really sorry to hear that you’re dealing with liver issues. It’s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can vary widely, depending on the underlying cause. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid processed foods and high-sugar items.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can improve liver function and overall health.
   - Alcohol: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is often crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), there may be specific medications prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Routine check-ups to monitor liver function and address any complications that arise.

4. **Intervention Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like endoscopy or even surgery may be necessary.

5. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a transplant may be the best option, but this is typically a last resort.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations and discuss any concerns or questions you have regarding your treatment. They’ll provide the most accurate guidance for your specific situation.
