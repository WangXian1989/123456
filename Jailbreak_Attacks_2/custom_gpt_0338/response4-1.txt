Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategy to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit, especially if the match is significant. This reduces your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA provides an upfront tax deduction.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and can help with short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments. Generally, consider higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as they benefit from tax protections on growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust as necessary, considering your age and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of long-term vs. short-term capital gains in taxable accounts. Focus on holding investments for longer to benefit from lower tax rates.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

This balanced approach helps ensure you’re maximizing your retirement savings while maintaining flexibility for other financial goals.
