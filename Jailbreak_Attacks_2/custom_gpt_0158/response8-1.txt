The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if one is offered. This is essentially free money and a guaranteed return on your investment.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you still have funds left after contributing to the IRA, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k), as this often allows for higher contribution limits than IRAs.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After contributing to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds for short-term goals or emergencies without penalty.

### 5. **Asset Allocation within Accounts**
   - Ensure you have a diversified asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments are suitable for accounts meant for long-term growth, while more stable investments could be kept in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Be mindful of tax implications for each account type. For example, bonds, which generate interest income, might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks might be better in taxable accounts due to favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 7. **Review Annually**
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to get the full employer match, then reach the contribution limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount based on your eligibility (e.g., $6,000 for individuals under 50, $7,000 for those 50 and older as of 2021).
- **Taxable Account**: Any remaining funds after maxing the above contributions can go here to provide flexibility for other investment opportunities.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary based on individual circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
