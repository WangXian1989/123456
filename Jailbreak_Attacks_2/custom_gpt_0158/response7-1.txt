When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax considerations, and your current and expected future income levels. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contribution**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money”. If you can afford it, aim to max out your contributions each year. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over age 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either traditional or Roth. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50). Choosing a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA), you can use any additional funds to invest in taxable accounts. This offers more liquidity and flexibility with fewer restrictions on withdrawals.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth investments (like stocks) since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. In taxable accounts, it may be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to reduce risk. Each account type can have a varying allocation based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have a sufficient emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a highly liquid account, such as a savings account.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Revisit your asset allocation periodically (at least annually) and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution hinges on your unique financial picture and long-term goals.
