I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while reducing saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Alcohol**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease might be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Schedule routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess any changes.

   - In severe cases, options such as liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
