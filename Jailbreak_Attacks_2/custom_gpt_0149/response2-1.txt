To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. If you qualify for a Roth, prioritize it for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need more access to in the short term. Here, focus on investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investment portfolio with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and diversify across asset classes.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk and return.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, a professional can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation.

This strategy helps maximize growth while considering tax implications.
