Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.
   - **Asset Location**: Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient ones (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Return**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, ensuring a balanced portfolio.

### 4. **Adjust Contributions Based on Goals**
   - Reassess your contribution strategies regularly based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

By effectively managing your accounts with these strategies, you can enhance growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
