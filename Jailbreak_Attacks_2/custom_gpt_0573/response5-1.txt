Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This account allows for tax-deferred growth, which can significantly enhance your retirement savings over time.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now but is taxed upon withdrawal. Consider individual retirement account limits and tax implications when deciding the amount.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that yield capital gains or dividends, particularly if you anticipate needing access to those funds before retirement. This can provide you with more liquidity and flexibility.

**General Distribution Tips:**
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.
- Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially considering current tax laws and investment opportunities.

By carefully balancing contributions among these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications.
