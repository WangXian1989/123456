1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or slow disease progression.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.
4. **Supplements**: Certain vitamins and supplements might support liver health, but always discuss these with your doctor.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare provider for a specific diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
