Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeframe. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible (for 2023, up to $22,500, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
- **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify; it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA could be beneficial.

### 2. Taxable Accounts
Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, focus on taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement age.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Growth Investments:** Hold stocks or stock funds in tax-advantaged accounts for the long-term growth and tax-deferred growth.
- **Income-Generating Investments:** Place bonds or dividend-generating stocks in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 4. Ongoing Adjustments
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or tax laws.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and objectives.
