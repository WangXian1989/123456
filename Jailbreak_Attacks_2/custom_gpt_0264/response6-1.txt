To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider fully funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are usually taxed at lower rates.
   - **Bonds and Interest Income**: Hold bonds within tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on interest income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Goals**: Tailor your investment choices (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and financial goals in each account.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### Summary
- **Priority**: Fund 401(k) to match, then IRA, and lastly, taxable accounts.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Keep income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
