I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition, but common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat specific liver diseases, like hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests are crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

5. **Natural Supplements**: Some people consider milk thistle or other supplements, but consult a doctor before use.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
