When it comes to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach often depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies for each account type:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to Traditional/Roth IRA:** Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA. 
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later on.

3. **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This includes holding index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover rates.

4. **Asset Location Strategy:** Aim to keep your bonds and other fixed-income investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) where interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate. Higher-growth investments, such as stocks, may be better in taxable accounts because they can benefit from favorable long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your investments across all account types are diversified to minimize risk. This means holding a mix of asset classes, such as equities, bonds, and cash equivalents.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio across accounts based on performance and changes in your personal financial situation.

7. **Withdrawals and Distributions:** Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts can help manage your tax liability effectively.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Your individual situation may have nuances that warrant professional advice. A financial advisor can help tailor strategies specific to your goals.

Always consider the specific rules and contribution limits for each type of account when planning your distributions. It's important to stay informed about any changes to tax laws or contribution limits that may affect your strategy.
