To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth. Aim to max out these accounts if possible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Implement a diversified asset allocation strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals. For instance, allocate bonds to tax-advantaged accounts where interest income is taxed at ordinary rates.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially if your investments have grown at different rates.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Tax Planning for Withdrawals**: Once you retire, develop a strategy for withdrawals that minimizes your tax liability over time. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By following these strategies, you can maximize tax efficiency and long-term growth potential within your retirement and investment accounts. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
