To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a match since it's essentially free money. Then, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and eligibility.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, invest in tax-deferred funds or target-date funds that match your retirement timeline.
   - **IRA**: If you’re using a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. Consider high-growth investments here since the account grows tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, this is a great place for tax-free growth. It's beneficial for younger individuals who expect higher income in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider tax-managed funds to minimize capital gains distributions.

3. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify investments across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Different accounts may serve varying purposes (short-term vs. long-term growth).

4. **Retirement Timeline**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how close you are to retirement. The closer you get, the more conservative you might want to be.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your strategy based on performance, tax implications, and changes in your financial situation. Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your current financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

Distributing your investments depends significantly on your individual circumstances, so consider all factors to tailor the approach that suits you best.
