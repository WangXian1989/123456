Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) if you can, benefiting from tax deferral.

4. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Aim for the maximum allowable contribution.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

6. **Invest Based on Goals**:
   - For long-term growth (retirement), focus on stocks or stock mutual funds.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider more conservative investments.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual situation.
