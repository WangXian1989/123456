Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a good plan with low fees, consider maximizing your contributions to this account, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate a lower tax impact, like index funds or long-term capital gains. This can provide liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and within each account type to manage risk.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxable, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Strategy your withdrawals accordingly.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
