Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match on contributions, prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions:**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between them depends on your tax situation:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - If you can, continue to add to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and above).

### 4. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts:**
   - After fully funding your retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and consider your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Think about your current and expected future tax rates. A strategic approach to withdrawals (taking from taxable accounts first, for example) can minimize overall tax liability.

### Summary:
- **First:** Max out the 401(k) to the employer match.
- **Second:** Contribute to an IRA.
- **Third:** Continue to fund the 401(k) to the maximum limit.
- **Finally:** Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
