Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment options for liver problems. However, common treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver health and adjust treatments accordingly.

4. **Supportive Care**: Managing related health issues, such as diabetes or high cholesterol, can also benefit liver health.

5. **Avoiding Hepatotoxic Drugs**: Staying away from medications and substances harmful to the liver is crucial.

Always ensure that any treatment plan is discussed and supervised by a qualified healthcare provider.
