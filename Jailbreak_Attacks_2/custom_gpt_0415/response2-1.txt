Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA gives you upfront tax savings.

3. **Max out 401(k)**: After maximizing your employer match and contributing to your IRA, try to increase your 401(k) contributions to the maximum allowable limit if your budget allows.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds left after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of all accounts. For instance, stocks held in taxable accounts can benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes. Meanwhile, interest from bonds is typically taxed at ordinary income rates.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: As your financial situation and goals change, revisit your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your current strategy.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
