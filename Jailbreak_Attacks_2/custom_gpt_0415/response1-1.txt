Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible and can be accessed anytime without penalties, but you'll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains. 

3. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline**: If you’re far from retirement, you might prioritize the growth potential of tax-advantaged accounts. As retirement approaches, consider balancing your investments to preserve capital.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and adjust your distributions based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also help you create a tailored plan based on your specific circumstances.
