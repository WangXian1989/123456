To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Usually has higher contribution limits and tax deferral benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages depending on the type; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may incur capital gains taxes or for funds you might need before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset mix.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies considering your specific financial situation and goals.

Overall, aim to balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth across these accounts.
