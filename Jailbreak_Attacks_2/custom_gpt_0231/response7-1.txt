To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Aim to maximize your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k):** Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds. These provide broad market exposure and are easy to manage.
   - **IRA:** Similar strategy as your 401(k), but you may have access to a wider variety of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments or taxable bonds. Consider tax-efficient funds or strategies, like holding tax-exempt securities.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable events, like qualified dividends.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it reflects your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.

This strategy helps optimize your tax situation while enabling long-term growth. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
