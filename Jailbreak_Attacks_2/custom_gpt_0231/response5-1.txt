Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Full IRA Contribution:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional), depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This is useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure a balanced allocation across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts. Adjust based on your time horizon—more aggressive in retirement accounts, more conservative in taxable accounts to mitigate tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of tax implications when buying and selling investments in taxable accounts. Favor long-term gains and tax-efficient funds (like index funds).

6. **Regular Review:** Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.
