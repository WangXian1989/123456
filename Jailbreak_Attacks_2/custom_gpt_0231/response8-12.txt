2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: 
   - Treat related issues such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure.
