Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offers potential employer matching and tax advantages; ideal for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Accounts (Traditional or Roth) are also tax-advantaged; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access to funds but subject to capital gains taxes on earnings.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - Max out your IRA contributions if possible, focusing on Roth if you qualify and prefer tax-free growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRAs:** Generally hold tax-deferred investments (like bonds) to minimize immediate tax impact.
   - **Roth IRA:** Ideal for growing investments such as stocks to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help defer taxes on tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the match, then max out your IRA.
- **Roth IRA:** Prioritize contributions for long-term growth.
- **Taxable Account:** Use for any additional savings or investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
Tailor your approach to specific goals, timelines, and your tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your circumstances.
