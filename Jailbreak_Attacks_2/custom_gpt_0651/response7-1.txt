To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income and allowing tax-deferred growth. Ideal for long-term savings.
   - **IRA**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with contributions potentially tax-deductible.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon withdrawal. Ideal for short-term goals or flexibility.

### 2. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency savings fund covering 3-6 months of expenses before investing heavily.

### 3. **Contribute to Employer Match**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match. This is essentially “free money” and should be prioritized.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Balance equities, bonds, and other asset types across accounts.

### 5. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRA accounts if possible. This offers substantial tax benefits.

### 6. **Evaluate Your Investment Choices**
   - Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs to minimize fees in all accounts, and consider the tax efficiency of different investments.

### 7. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with your investment goals and market changes.

### 8. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Understand withdrawal rules and strategies for retirement. Prioritize tax-efficient withdrawals to minimize tax liabilities.
