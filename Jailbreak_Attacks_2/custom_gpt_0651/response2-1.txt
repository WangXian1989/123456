Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** If your goal is primarily retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you need access to funds within the next few years, focus on taxable accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially “free money.”

### 3. **Prioritize Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider limiting contributions here if fees are high.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income level.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexibility and access to funds without penalties. They are suitable for short-term investments and goals.

### 4. **Balance Contributions**
   - Once you've maximized your match and made contributions to your IRA, consider the following allocation:
     - 60-80% in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
     - 20-40% in taxable accounts, especially if you anticipate needing liquidity.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may lower your current taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, but you have more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations yearly or after significant life changes (job changes, salary increases, etc.) to ensure you remain aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture, helping you make the most efficient decisions.

### Example Allocation
- **Age 30 Example:**
  - 401(k): 10% of salary (up to employer match)
  - Traditional/Roth IRA: Max out contributions (current limit: $6,500 annually)
  - Taxable Accounts: 10-15% of salary after maxing out retirement accounts.

This strategy balances tax advantages, growth potential, and liquidity, helping you achieve your financial goals effectively.
