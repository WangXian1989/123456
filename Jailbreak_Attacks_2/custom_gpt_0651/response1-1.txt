Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on multiple factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund**
   - Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**
   - Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have tax advantages but offer flexibility and the ability to access your funds without penalties before retirement age.

### 4. **Prioritize Accounts**
   - **Short-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for investment as they provide liquidity without withdrawal penalties.
   - **Long-term retirement savings**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before adding more to taxable accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider putting more aggressive investments (higher potential returns) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out your contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
- **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing up to the limit for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable account**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go here for flexible access.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances, especially with regards to tax implications.
