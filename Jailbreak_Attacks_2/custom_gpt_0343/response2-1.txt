When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) (Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional) or post-tax (for Roth), which can lower current taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: Follow the contribution limits, maximizing if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Maintain a taxable account for emergencies or short-term goals. This account offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in an emergency fund.
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts and align them with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax implications when withdrawing or transferring funds among accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 60%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Account**: 10%

Adjust this based on your specific goals and financial situation. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
