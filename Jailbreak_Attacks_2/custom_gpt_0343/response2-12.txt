I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.
   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is vital.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral drugs for hepatitis.**
   - **Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.**
   - **Diuretics for fluid retention.**

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests like ultrasounds or MRIs.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Therapies:**
   - Nutritional support and counseling.
   - Management of associated conditions (e.g., diabetes).

Always seek guidance from your healthcare provider to develop an appropriate treatment strategy.
