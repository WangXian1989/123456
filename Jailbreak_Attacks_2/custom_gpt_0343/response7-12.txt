I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antivirals for hepatitis.

3. **Nutrition**: Working with a dietitian to follow a liver-friendly diet that is low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or failure, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
