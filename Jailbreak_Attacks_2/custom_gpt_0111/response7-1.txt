Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider both traditional and Roth IRAs. If you're eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or once you max out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Mix asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and returns. Tailor your asset allocation based on time horizon and risk tolerance.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow. Use 401(k) and IRAs strategically depending on your tax bracket.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your distributions and investment performance to ensure alignment with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
