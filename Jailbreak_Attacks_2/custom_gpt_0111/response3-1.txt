Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Further 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match and contributing to the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) if you can. Aim for higher contribution limits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments outside of tax-advantaged accounts. This might include stocks, bonds, or ETFs. Taxable accounts offer flexibility with withdrawals but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Balance Growth and Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Keep bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize immediate tax liability.

6. **Consider Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits. If you expect a higher tax bracket, focus on Roth accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changing income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your unique situation.
