I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options usually include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, treatments may include antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly help liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can track liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Dietary Supplements**: Some people benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult your healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan.
