I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Weight Management**: For those with fatty liver disease, weight loss can help reduce liver fat and inflammation.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies, or even liver transplantation, may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan based on your specific condition.
