The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Accounts**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth options) if you are eligible. Roth IRAs, in particular, offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Balancing Your Portfolio**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Diversifying across different account types can help manage taxes and access to funds.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and individual circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

It's important to continuously review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
