I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional about liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely based on the specific issue. Some common approaches may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions like diabetes or hepatitis. In certain cases, medications or even surgery might be required. Please seek medical advice for a tailored treatment plan.
