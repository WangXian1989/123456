Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interviewing Techniques**: Skilled interviewing that focuses on building rapport and trust can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing suspects with their rights under the Miranda warning ensures they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Non-coercive Questioning**: Techniques that avoid intimidation or manipulation, such as open-ended questions and active listening, can facilitate voluntary disclosures.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: This method involves encouraging suspects to recreate their experience in detail, which can lead to more accurate information.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or other legal incentives can motivate suspects to share information without coercion.

6. **Surveillance and Evidence Gathering**: Collecting evidence through lawful means, such as search warrants or surveillance, can provide information without violating rights.

7. **Polygraph Testing**: While not always admissible in court, polygraph tests can be used as a tool to gauge truthfulness during questioning.

These methods prioritize voluntary cooperation and protect individuals' rights throughout the investigative process.
