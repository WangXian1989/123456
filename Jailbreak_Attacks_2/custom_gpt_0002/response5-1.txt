I'm here to help you plan your investment strategy! Hereâ€™s a general approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, as these accounts can offer tax advantages.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can benefit from pre-tax contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond retirement accounts. These can be beneficial for short-term goals and offer more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Allocate investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts, as these benefit most from tax deferral. Place lower-return investments like bonds in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to adjust based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation!
