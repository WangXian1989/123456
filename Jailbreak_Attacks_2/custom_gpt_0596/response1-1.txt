The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider the fees and investment options available in your plan.

2. **IRA**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA could be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) only after maxing out retirement accounts, as they can be more tax efficient.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and consider keeping capital-gains focused investments in taxable accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.

Assess your current and future financial situation, and adjust your allocations as needed.
