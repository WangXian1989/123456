Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to at least receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” and can provide a strong foundation for your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k) if contributions are tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest after you maximize tax-advantaged accounts. Earnings on investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and income taxes on dividends.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid savings account before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial situations and goals change over time. Regularly reassess how your money is distributed and make adjustments as necessary.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Efficiently managing withdrawals can minimize taxes and extend the life of your investments.

7. **Tax Bracket Awareness**: Understand your current and future tax bracket to strategize contributions and withdrawals effectively.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your entire financial picture.

It's essential to tailor your approach to your unique circumstances.
