Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, it's usually best to contribute enough to get the full match before prioritizing other accounts. This is essentially "free money." Maximize your contributions to take advantage of any tax benefits.

2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. A Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're eligible, aim to maximize your IRA contributions as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve secured the maximum contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### Strategic Distribution
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Focus on contributing to your 401(k) up to the match, then fully fund your IRA. After maxing out these accounts, allocate money to your taxable accounts.
- **Maintain Balance:** Diversify investments across all account types to manage risk and prepare for taxes. 
- **Consider Time Horizon:** If you plan to retire soon, it might be wise to have more in conservative investments across your accounts. In contrast, younger investors can typically afford to take on more risk.
- **Tax Implications:** Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts may be more suitable for shorter-term goals due to their liquidity, while tax-advantaged accounts are ideal for long-term retirement savings.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
