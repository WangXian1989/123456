Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
   - **401(k) First**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Next**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments beyond retirement savings.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Pre-Tax vs. After-Tax**: 401(k) and traditional IRAs typically offer pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income now. Roth accounts and taxable accounts use after-tax dollars.
   - **Capital Gains**: Long-term investments in taxable accounts benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 3. Diversify Investments
   - Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon within each account type.

### 4. Assess Your Time Horizon
   - Longer-term funds (e.g., retirement accounts) might be more aggressively invested compared to shorter-term needs (e.g., taxable accounts for upcoming expenses).

### 5. Regularly Reassess
   - Life changes (income fluctuations, changing expenses) and market conditions can affect how you should allocate your investments.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (focus on maxing out to capture employer match)
- **IRA**: 5-10% (or to the contribution limit)
- **Taxable**: Any remaining funds, especially for savings goals with shorter timelines.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice, as they can help tailor a plan based on your unique situation.
