Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are often pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Consider Roth IRAs**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Max Contribution**: Aim to max out contributions each year, as IRAs have tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Long-term Investments**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Balance your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type.
- **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for retirement goals and taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

### Regular Review:
- Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
