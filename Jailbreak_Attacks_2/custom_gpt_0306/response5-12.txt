I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
