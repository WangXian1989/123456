To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) if there's an employer match, and then contribute to your IRA. Use a Roth IRA if you're eligible and prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are fully taxable, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Allocation**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA): Focus on growth-oriented investments like stocks or mutual funds, as taxes defer until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider growth stocks since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments or bonds to minimize tax implications.

4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals.

5. **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor to align with your specific goals and tax situation.

This balanced approach can enhance growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively.
