Distributing your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for short-term goals and flexibility. Consider holding investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends for tax efficiency.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Tailor your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance. Long-term accounts can afford more volatility, while short-term savings should be more conservative.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations in each account to maintain your desired risk level.
