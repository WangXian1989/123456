To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Focus on this account for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs give you potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient, like stocks or index funds, which benefit from favorable capital gains tax rates.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts due to higher interest income tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to optimize taxes on your overall investment returns.
