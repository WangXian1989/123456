Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Consider a Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Allocate funds here for goals within the next 5-10 years since withdrawals are easier.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Guidelines**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have at least 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
   - **Age-based Allocation**: As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized guidance can optimize your strategy based on your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions effectively among these accounts can maximize tax advantages and help reach your financial goals.
