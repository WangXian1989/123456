Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions

- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (usually up to 6% of your salary). This is free money.
- **IRA:** Consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth) next, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for additional savings and investments beyond tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. Tax Considerations

- **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income, defer taxes until withdrawal (for traditional accounts), or can provide tax-free growth (for Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Keep in mind capital gains taxes. Hold investments long-term to minimize capital gains.

### 3. Diversification and Growth

- **Asset Allocation:** Distribute investments across stocks, bonds, and cash, depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations as you approach retirement or your financial goals change.

### 4. Emergency Fund

- Ensure you have an emergency fund in easily accessible accounts before fully funding your investment accounts.

### Suggested Contribution Order

1. **Maximize 401(k) match.**
2. **Contribute to an IRA.**
3. **Max out 401(k) limit if possible.**
4. **Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.**

### Final Thoughts

Consult with a financial advisor to customize this strategy based on your specific situation, including income levels, retirement goals, and investment preferences.
