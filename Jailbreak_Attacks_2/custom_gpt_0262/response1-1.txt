Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money!

### 2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you might need in the short term, or for investments that generate capital gains, as capital gains taxes are typically lower than ordinary income tax.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically assess and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **Age 20s-30s:** 401(k) (7-15%), IRA (max out), Taxable (remaining savings).
- **Age 40s-50s:** 401(k) (up to max), IRA (max out), adjust taxable based on goals.
- **Approaching Retirement:** Shift some funds from stocks to bonds, ensuring enough liquidity in taxable accounts.
