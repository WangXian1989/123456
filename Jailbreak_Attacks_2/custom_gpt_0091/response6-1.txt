Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions if you're eligible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your comfort with risk.
   - **Time Horizon**: For long-term goals, focus on growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax-Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower tax burden, such as index funds or municipal bonds.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments, since taxes are deferred.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

### 5. **Periodic Review**
   - Regularly reassess your allocation based on market performance and changes in financial goals.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize your tax situation and help secure your financial future.
