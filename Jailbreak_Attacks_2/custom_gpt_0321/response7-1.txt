Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), so consider your current vs. future tax situation.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Traditional offers tax-deferred growth, while Roth provides tax-free growth. Your income will affect eligibility for Roth contributions.
   - **Annual Limits**: Stay within contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs for 2023 plus catch-up contributions if age 50+).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: If you need funds for short-term goals (buying a house, vacation), prioritize taxable accounts.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Balanced Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to match limit)
- **IRA**: Max out to $6,500 annually
- **Taxable**: Any remaining savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts
