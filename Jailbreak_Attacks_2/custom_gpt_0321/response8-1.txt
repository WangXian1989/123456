To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income; ideal for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductibility; Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider these for flexibility and accessibility. Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax impacts from capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher growth investments (stocks) due to tax benefits.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes, which can involve balancing risk and return.

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.
