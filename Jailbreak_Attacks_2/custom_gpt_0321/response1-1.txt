Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Growth**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax-deferred growth. Aim to max out your IRA if you can.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider Roth IRA contributions where you pay taxes now and withdraw tax-free later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need in the short term, as they offer flexibility for withdrawals. Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative holdings in taxable accounts to manage taxes.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be mindful of fees in each type of account. Lower costs can significantly impact your returns.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced strategy tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.
