Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s before contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts can grow tax-deferred (or tax-free, in the case of Roth accounts).

3. **Consider Income Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement, a taxable account might be necessary, as 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawals (with some exceptions).

4. **Diverse Investment Strategies**: Diversification is key. Ensure youâ€™re spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Distributions are taxed at your ordinary income rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow similar tax rules as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed in the year they are realized, and dividends and interest are also taxable. Strategize to minimize capital gains by holding investments long-term.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure to have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

7. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and shifts in your personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
