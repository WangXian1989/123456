Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also defer taxes; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions arenâ€™t tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These may be less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes, but they're more flexible for withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications. 
   - Place safer, income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution levels based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before directing significant funds into these accounts.

Seek guidance from a financial advisor to tailor your approach to your specific situation.
