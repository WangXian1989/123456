Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax (for traditional accounts) or post-tax (for Roth accounts), affecting your taxable income. Maximize contributions to these accounts to reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't offer the same tax benefits, but earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates depending on your tax bracket.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. A diversified portfolio can include stocks, bonds, and other assets within each account type.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a readily accessible account.

5. **Long-Term Plans**: Consider how soon you will need to access your money. Money in a 401(k) or IRA often has penalties for early withdrawal before age 59Â½, whereas taxable accounts do not.

6. **Review Periodically**: Regularly review your allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

You might want to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.
