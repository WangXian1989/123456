When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Taxation Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal, usually at retirement, when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment growth is subject to capital gains tax, usually more favorable than ordinary income tax. However, dividends and interest are taxed as ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize your growth potential with lower taxes.
   - **Short-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next few years. These investments should typically be more liquid and less volatile.

### 3. **Employer Match**
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and offers immediate returns.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Aim for diversified investments across all accounts. A balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets reduces risk.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Ideally, draw from tax-deferred accounts first, then tax-free accounts, and finally taxable accounts to minimize taxes over time.

### Example Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k)** contributions to the match limit.
2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA** for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Fund taxable accounts** with any remaining funds for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion
Adjust this strategy based on your personal financial situation, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Consulting with a financial advisor can also be beneficial for tailored advice.
