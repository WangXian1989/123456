Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income level, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA):** Distributions are taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw in retirement. Consider your expected tax rate at retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Aim to diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Different accounts can hold different asset classes based on their tax treatment and your investment strategy.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts periodically and rebalance as necessary based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and changing market conditions.

### 5. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2024, the contribution limits are:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older)
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older)

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. A common strategy is to draw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts to minimize taxes.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. They can help create a comprehensive strategy that aligns with your long-term objectives.
