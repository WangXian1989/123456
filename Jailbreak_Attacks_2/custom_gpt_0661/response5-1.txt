Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. 401(k):
- **Pros**: Offers potential employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
- **Cons**: Limited investment options and potential penalties for early withdrawal.
- **Recommendation**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially “free money.” If you can afford to save more, consider maxing out contributions.

### 2. IRA (Traditional or Roth):
- **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Recommendation**: If you’re eligible, a Roth IRA generally offers more flexible tax advantages, particularly if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Diversifying between both types can provide tax flexibility.

### 3. Taxable Accounts:
- **Pros**: No contribution limits, and you can access funds at any time without penalties. Investments can be more diverse.
- **Cons**: Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they're received, and capital gains tax applies when selling investments for a profit.
- **Recommendation**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings goals or investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax. 

### General Strategy:
1. **Prioritize contributions**: Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund an IRA, and finally contribute to taxable accounts.
2. **Consider your tax situation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize Roth contributions; if you're currently in a high bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.
3. **Diversify investments**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Conclusion:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help you tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
