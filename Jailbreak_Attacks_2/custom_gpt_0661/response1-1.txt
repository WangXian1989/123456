Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible (traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth option may be favorable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Capital gains are taxed when assets are sold.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments to mitigate risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before focusing solely on investments.

5. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal finance can be complex. A professional can tailor advice to your unique situation, focusing on your long-term goals.

By balancing contributions across these accounts strategically, you maximize growth potential while managing tax efficiency.
