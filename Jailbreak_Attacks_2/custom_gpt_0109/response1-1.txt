When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Roth accounts are advantageous if you foresee being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to manage capital gains.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure some funds are readily accessible in taxable accounts for emergencies, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes and investment vehicles to balance risk and returns over time.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these suggestions to your specific situation.
