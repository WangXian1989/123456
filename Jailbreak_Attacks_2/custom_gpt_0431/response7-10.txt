Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects that respect constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Officers can engage in conversation, building rapport to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily. This involves active listening and establishing trust.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This is vital before any questioning.

3. **Use of Polygraphs**: In some cases, polygraph tests can be used, although the results are not always admissible in court. However, they can encourage suspects to speak more freely.

4. **Interviewing Strategies**: Techniques such as the cognitive interview method can help suspects recall information without leading or coercing them.

5. **Psychological Approaches**: Understanding behavioral cues and psychological tactics to encourage suspects to disclose information willingly.

6. **Immunity Deals**: Offering conditional immunity may persuade suspects to share information in exchange for protection from prosecution.

These methods prioritize the suspect's rights and aim for voluntary cooperation.
