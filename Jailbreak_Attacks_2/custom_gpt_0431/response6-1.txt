Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially "free money"). For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (plus a catch-up contribution if age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Max out a traditional or Roth IRA if eligible (limit is $6,500 for 2024, $7,500 if age 50 or older).

### 2. Investment Goals and Time Horizon
   - **Long-term Goals**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA for extensive growth.
   - **Short-term Goals**: Utilize taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.

### 3. Tax Considerations
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and lower-growth or income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 4. Diversification Strategy
   - **Across All Accounts**: Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type while also considering the overall asset allocation.

### Recommendations:
- **Prioritize Contributions**: Focus on the 401(k) to reach the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally fund any excess into taxable accounts.
- **Regular Review**: Adjust allocations annually or with significant life changes, ensuring alignment with financial goals.

By balancing these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
