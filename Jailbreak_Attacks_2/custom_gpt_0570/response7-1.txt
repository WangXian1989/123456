The best distribution strategy depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Ensure you contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.
3. **Allocating Beyond Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider additional contributions to your 401(k) and taxable accounts.
4. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes across all accounts to reduce risk.
5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for how and when you might withdraw funds in retirement, as this could influence your allocation decisions. 

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific situation.
