Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - Consider opening and contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between them depends on your current tax situation and future expectations:
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can afford it, aim to maximize your 401(k) contributions after funding your IRA.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use features like tax-loss harvesting to offset capital gains.

### 5. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the tax implications of each.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your contributions and allocations based on changes in income, taxes, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to the match)
- **IRA**: $6,000/year (or $7,000 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining savings for flexibility and liquidity

### Conclusion
By following this structured approach, you can optimize your retirement savings while considering tax implications. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
