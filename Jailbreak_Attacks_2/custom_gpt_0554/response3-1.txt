Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves understanding your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here's a guide to help you strategize your allocations:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Identify your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider factors like retirement age, expected expenses, and lifestyle.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This employer-sponsored retirement plan allows pre-tax contributions, reducing taxable income in the year contributed. Check if there's an employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be either Traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or Roth (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your income level and tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but incur capital gains taxes on profits and dividends.

3. **Strategize Contributions**:
   - **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.
   - **Prioritize IRA contributions**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions here for tax-free growth. Otherwise, contribute to a Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or additional investments once retirement accounts are funded.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be aware of tax implications for each account type. Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts and consider location optimization, placing high-growth or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Annually reassess your financial situation and adjust contributions as income or tax laws change.
   - Rebalance your portfolio within each account to maintain desired asset allocation.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your unique situation, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations.
