When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors influence the best strategy, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the match limit. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maximizing contributions, especially if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Investment Choices:** Check the investment options available in your plan and their fees.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Treatment:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both types. For 2024, it's $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Withdrawal Flexibility:** Roth IRAs offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals, and you can withdraw your contributions without penalty.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer easy access to your funds without penalties or restrictions, making them a good option for short-term savings or investments.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in taxable accounts. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that minimize distributions.

### **General Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Max Out the Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After the match, contribute to your IRA (preferably a Roth if you qualify).
3. **Max Out 401(k):** Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Finally, invest any additional savings in a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

### **Final Tips:**
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Keep your asset allocation in check as market conditions change.
- **Consider Fees:** Pay attention to the fees associated with your investment options in each account type.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're uncertain, a financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

The ideal distribution depends on your unique financial situation and goals, so adjust the plan as necessary through different life stages.
