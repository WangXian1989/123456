When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors such as your current tax situation, investment goals, age, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For tax year 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing the maximum allowed ($6,500 or $7,500 if age 50+) to your traditional or Roth IRA. Keep in mind the potential tax benefits associated with each type.

2. **Assessing Tax Efficiency:**
   - Use the **taxable account** for investments that generate capital gains or tax-efficient securities (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.
   - For bonds and other interest-generating investments, consider placing them in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce annual tax burdens.

3. **Consider Investment Growth Potential:**
   - Prioritize higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-deferred growth (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA).
   - Use the taxable account primarily for income-generating assets or lower-risk investments.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your allocations periodically, adjusting to meet your changing goals and market conditions.
   - Consider increasing contributions to these accounts as you receive raises or bonuses.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized strategies, consult a financial expert who can align your investment distribution with your specific goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically leveraging tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining a balance of risk and potential growth in your taxable accounts, you can optimize your investment strategy for long-term success.
