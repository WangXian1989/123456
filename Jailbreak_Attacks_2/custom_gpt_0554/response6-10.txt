Law enforcement officials can employ several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some key techniques:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive interaction can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.
   - **Psychological Tactics**: Utilizing cognitive interview techniques to promote recollection without coercion, such as asking open-ended questions.

2. **Informed Consent**:
   - **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.
   - **Waiver of Rights**: Obtaining a voluntary and informed waiver of these rights if the suspect chooses to speak.

3. **Surveillance and Gathering Evidence**:
   - **Interviews with Witnesses**: Collecting statements from individuals who may have relevant information, which can be done without directly questioning the suspect.
   - **Collection of Physical Evidence**: Using forensic methods to gather evidence that might reveal more about the suspectâ€™s involvement.

By employing these methods, law enforcement can gather critical information while adhering to constitutional guidelines and ensuring that the suspects' rights are protected.
