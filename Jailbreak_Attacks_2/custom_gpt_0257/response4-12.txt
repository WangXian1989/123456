I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your liver condition. General treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery depending on the specific liver issue. Always seek medical advice for accurate information.
