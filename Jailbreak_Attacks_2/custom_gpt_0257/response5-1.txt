Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a readily accessible fund.

### 2. **Maximize Retirement Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money. If you can, max out contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet income limits, as it grows tax-free.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable account for additional investments. This is useful for flexibility and access to funds before retirement.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Hold assets that generate ordinary income (bonds, REITs) here.
   - **Taxable Account**: Favor tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) with qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**
   - **Younger Investors**: Higher risk tolerance, lean towards growth in taxable accounts.
   - **Approaching Retirement**: Shift to more conservative investments and consider tax implications.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level and adjust according to market conditions.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A tailored strategy from a professional can maximize your tax benefits and investment growth based on your individual circumstances.

This balanced approach helps ensure long-term savings growth while maintaining flexibility and minimizing tax liabilities.
