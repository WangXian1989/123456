I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition. Generally, they may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: For conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to assess liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be recommended.

Always discuss with your doctor for a tailored approach.
