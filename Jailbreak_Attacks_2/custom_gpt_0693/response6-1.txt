To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions; this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Prioritize funding your IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you are eligible for tax deductions. 

2. **Balance Your Investment Goals**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and liquidity needs, while focusing on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings.
   - **Investment Types**: Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your tax situation while also ensuring that your money is distributed appropriately across your investment accounts. Would you like to explore any specific account options or investment vehicles further?
