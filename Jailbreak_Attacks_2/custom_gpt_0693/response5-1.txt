(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, it's a good idea to focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, since these can provide tax benefits. 

For instance, if your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), you should aim to at least contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider funding your IRA, which can be a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. After maximizing these accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

When it comes to distributing your stash among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's all about playing it smart and maximizing those gains while keeping Uncle Sam at bay. First off, if your employer is dropping some match money into your 401(k), you better be taking advantage of that! It's like getting free cashâ€”why wouldnâ€™t you?

After you've snagged that sweet match, think about loading up your IRA. Whether you go for the traditional or Roth comes down to if you want to pay tax now or later. Roth IRAs are dope for tax-free growth, but if you're feeling the pinch now, that tax deduction from traditional IRAs can feel nice. Finally, once you've milked those tax-advantaged accounts for all they're worth, then shove some cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, but they won't give you the sweet tax breaks. Just remember, keep your long-term goals in mind, and make those investments work for you!
