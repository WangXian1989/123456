When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about several factors, including your current financial situation, your long-term investment goals, tax implications, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Contribution limits for 401(k) plans are relatively high, making them a strong option for pre-tax savings.

2. **IRAs (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. On the other hand, Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions, which could be advantageous if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA if you have maxed out your 401(k) contributions. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful if you need access to cash before retirement.
   - They also allow for capital gains tax treatment, which is typically lower than income tax rates. Consider holding investments in taxable accounts that you expect will appreciate over time, such as stocks.

**Overall Strategy**:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start with maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), then contribute to your IRA.
2. **Evaluate Allocation**: Depending on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline, allocate your investments accordingly. Growth investments might be better suited for your taxable accounts to take advantage of capital gains tax treatment.
3. **Consider Future Tax Impact**: Think about how the tax treatment of each account type will affect you in retirement. A mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility.

4. **Rebalance**: Periodically reassess your investment distribution as your financial goals and market conditions change.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation.
