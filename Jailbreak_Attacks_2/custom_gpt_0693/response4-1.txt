When it comes to distributing your money among different investment accounts such as a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, it's often beneficial to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly increase your retirement savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income and the type of IRA (Traditional or Roth), you may have different tax advantages. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals but will be subject to capital gains tax on investment profits.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Your investment allocation should align with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might favor more growth-oriented investments (stocks), while those closer to retirement might shift toward more conservative options (bonds).

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.
