Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider paying that down first before investing.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts can provide tax benefits. For 2023, the max contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and for an IRA, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you can allocate a portion of your assets into various investment types within these accounts. Typically, a higher-risk investment (like stocks) can be placed in growth-oriented accounts, while safer investments (like bonds) can be allocated in lower-risk environments.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRAs). If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, Roth options (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) may be attractive as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you've maxed out tax-advantaged account contributions and still want to invest, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: As your financial situation and goals change, revisit your allocation periodically and make adjustments as necessary.

This strategy is a general guideline, and it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
