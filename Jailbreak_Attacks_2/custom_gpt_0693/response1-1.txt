Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-deferred accounts, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money you contribute until you withdraw it in retirement. If you have a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible based on your income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you have a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating large amounts into retirement accounts, ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in place (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses).

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before contributing heavily into retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Once you've considered the above factors, aim to diversify your investments across accounts. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, especially if you're younger and have time to ride out market fluctuations.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider a mix of bonds and stocks.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for short- to mid-term goals. Consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

6. **Regular Review**: Re-evaluate your allocation regularly or after major life changes (like a new job, marriage, or a significant financial event) to ensure it aligns with your current financial goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your unique circumstances, so consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
