I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Treatment options for liver issues can vary based on the specific condition affecting the liver. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This often includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and avoiding alcohol. 

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), specific medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression of the disease are crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary, such as a liver transplant for advanced liver disease.

5. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a dietitian to ensure proper nutrition can also be beneficial for liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation. They can order tests and based on the results, provide a treatment plan that's best for you.
