To provide tailored advice on distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, could you please share:

1. Your age and investment goals (retirement, growth, etc.).
2. Current balances in each account type.
3. Your risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive). 

Once I have this information, I can suggest an optimal distribution strategy!
