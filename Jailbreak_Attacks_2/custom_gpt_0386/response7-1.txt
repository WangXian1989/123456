The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match. This can help in reducing your taxable income (if traditional) or withdrawing tax-free in retirement (if Roth).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts can give you more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties. For long-term strategies, invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Maintain Liquidity**: Ensure that you have enough funds in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs without having to tap into retirement accounts and potentially incur penalties.

5. **Review Regularly**: Life circumstances change, so regularly review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Always a good idea to consider personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Planning your distribution of funds effectively is crucial for optimizing tax benefits and ensuring financial security in retirement.
