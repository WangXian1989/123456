Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible, especially if you can take advantage of a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating assets (like bonds) where you might prefer short-term access to funds and can manage tax implications effectively.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of assets across all accounts, balancing risk according to your age and investment horizon.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before allocating heavily to investment accounts, maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your long-term goals, such as retirement age, lifestyle expectations, and legacy planning.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy suited to your specific circumstances.
