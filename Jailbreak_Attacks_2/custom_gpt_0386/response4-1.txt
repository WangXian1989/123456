To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax benefits, either through tax-deferred growth (401(k)) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA), depending on the type of account you have.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $19,500 (or $26,000 if over age 50 for 2023)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over age 50 for 2023)

3. **Employ a Tax Diversification Strategy**: Consider diversifying your tax exposure:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions reduce your taxable income today but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Consider your time horizon and financial goals. For retirement savings, prioritize these accounts first. If you have shorter-term goals, you might focus more on taxable accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unforeseen expenses.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility since they donâ€™t have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains tax.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and evolving financial goals to ensure your asset distribution aligns with your long-term strategy.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
