Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributionsâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you need tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for more flexibility in withdrawals and investments. This can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, ensure that high-interest debt (like credit cards) is paid down, as it usually negates investment gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts have varying tax implications. For example, long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income tax rates on 401(k) and IRA withdrawals.

7. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
