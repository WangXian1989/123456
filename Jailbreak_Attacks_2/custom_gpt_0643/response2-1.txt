The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest Beyond Limits**: If you have additional funds to invest after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) or open a taxable investment account for flexible investing without contribution limits.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, balancing for risk based on your age and time until retirement.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while holding less tax-efficient options (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific financial situation.
