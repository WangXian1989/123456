(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, a good approach is to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund your IRA as it offers tax advantages. Once those are handled, you can allocate any additional funds into taxable accounts. It's also wise to consider the tax implications of withdrawal from each account type and adjust your investment allocations according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

Start by maxing out that 401(k) if your employer matches contributionsâ€”free money is a no-brainer! After that, throw some cash into your IRA because who doesnâ€™t want those sweet tax benefits? Once you're done there, let it rip into taxable accounts for flexibility. Just keep an eye on taxesâ€”nobody wants Uncle Sam snatching a big chunk. Play it smart, adjust based on your goals, and don't forget to rebalance your investments like you're rearranging your sock drawer!
