The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.” Maximize your contributions to this account, especially if it has low fees and good investment options.

2. **IRA:** Consider a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement. Aim to contribute to this account to take advantage of tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for additional savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, and then allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts. It’s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
