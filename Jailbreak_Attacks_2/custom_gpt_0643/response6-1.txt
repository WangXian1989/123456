To optimize your asset allocation across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing employer match in your 401(k), consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and future tax expectations.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Allocate any funds beyond your 401(k) and IRA limits to taxable accounts. This allows you access to your money without penalties for early withdrawal.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while placing lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of tax treatments.

4. **Evaluate Your Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Match your asset allocation with your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and financial goals to ensure that you reach your targets efficiently.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your investments across different types of accounts while optimizing for tax implications and growth potential.
