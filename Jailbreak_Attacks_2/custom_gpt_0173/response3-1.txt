Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timelines. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money). Then, aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement; a Traditional IRA provides immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are more flexible but have less favorable tax treatment on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they produce fewer taxable events. Higher yielding or actively managed funds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, equities can be held in tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while bonds may be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly evaluate your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and goals change.

### Summary
1. Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the match.
2. Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility after maxing out other accounts.
4. Consider investment types for tax efficiency.
5. Regularly review your strategy.
