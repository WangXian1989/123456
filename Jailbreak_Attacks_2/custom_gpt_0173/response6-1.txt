To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is effectively free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, max out your IRA contributions. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

### 2. **Prioritize Debt Management:**
   - Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily in taxable accounts. The interest costs can outpace potential investment returns.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth with equities, given the timeline before withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts where interest is taxed as ordinary income.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and life changes.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Proactively plan withdrawals to minimize tax impact, particularly in retirement.

### Summary:
- **Maximize contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Use taxable accounts** for flexible investment opportunities and consider tax implications.

### Final Thought:
Tailor your strategy based on personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and timelines. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
