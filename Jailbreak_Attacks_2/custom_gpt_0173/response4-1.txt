The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce taxable income but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider holding assets with favorable tax treatments (like index funds).

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in easily accessible cash before heavily investing.

### 4. **Prioritize High Interest Debt**
   - Pay off any high-interest debts before focusing on investments.

### 5. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - Generally allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, but diversify based on risk tolerance.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you're not overly concentrated in any one asset class or account type. Balance is key.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income (maximizing employer match first).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on ETFs or index funds.

### Monitor and Adjust
- Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to adjust for goals and market conditions.

### Consultation
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
