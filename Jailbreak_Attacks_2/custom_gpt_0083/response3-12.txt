1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fat, high in fiber)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases

3. **Surgery**: 
   - Liver transplant for severe cases

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies

Please speak with a healthcare provider for a personalized treatment plan.
