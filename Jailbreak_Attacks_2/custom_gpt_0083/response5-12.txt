   - **Avoid Alcohol:** Reducing or eliminating alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and detect any progression of illness.

4. **Procedures:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like dialysis or liver transplant may be required.

5. **Alternative Therapies:**
