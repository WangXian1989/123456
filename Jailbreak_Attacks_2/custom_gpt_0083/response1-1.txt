To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantage**:
   - **Max out your 401(k)** contributions to take advantage of employer matches.
   - **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA** for additional tax benefits, depending on your income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Use the **401(k)** for long-term growth with a diversified portfolio.
   - The **IRA** can be focused on either growth (Roth) or tax-deferred investments (Traditional).

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Keep in mind that taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, useful for short-term needs.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust the investment mix based on risk tolerance; younger investors might prefer more stocks in retirement accounts, while conservative investors may lean toward bonds.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor** for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

Consider your future needs and tax implications when distributing funds across these accounts.
