To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Be sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers tax-deferred growth. Focus on tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) here.
   - **IRA**: If itâ€™s a Roth IRA, prioritize contributions here for tax-free growth; otherwise, treat it similarly to your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts for balanced risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax implications in retirement, considering when to withdraw from each account type.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.
