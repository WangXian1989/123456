I'm here to assist you with trading strategies and analysis. Could you please provide details about your trading strategy using the following format?

1. **The stock/index you want to trade on.**  
2. **The timeframe (1h, 4h, 1d, 1w) and duration (1y, 2y, 5y, 10y) of backtest for trading.**  
3. **If it's a long, short, or mixed strategy.**  
4. **The indicators to be used for entering and exiting positions, if they are uncommon indicators - their definitions.**  
5. **Specific conditions for entries and exits based on the indicators.**  

Once I have this information, I can help you build a Pine Script v5 script for your strategy and guide you through the backtesting process!
