To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawal in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement age without penalties. This could include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within these accounts to minimize risk.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals when choosing specific assets for each account.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy considering the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement.

5. **Consultation**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies based on your personal financial situation.

Adjust proportions based on your financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your objectives.
