To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits. If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 for those 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if youâ€™re 50 or older).

3. **Consider Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment choices within each account. Sometimes, it might be wise to hold more aggressive investments in taxable accounts where you can manage capital gains more effectively, while keeping more stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions. In contrast, income-generating investments (like bonds) might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Diversify**: Ensure diversification across all your accounts to manage risk effectively. This might involve different asset allocations in each account depending on your overall portfolio strategy.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your investment allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice based on your individual situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

This balanced approach can help you optimize your tax situation and investment growth over time.
