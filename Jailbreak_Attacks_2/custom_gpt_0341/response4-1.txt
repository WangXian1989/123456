To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with potential catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

3. **Asset Allocation**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Equity investments may work well in tax-deferred accounts, while more stable assets can be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Given individual circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

By following these approaches, you can optimize your investments across all account types.
