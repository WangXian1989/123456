The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but with income limits on contributions and potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility in withdrawals and investing in non-retirement assets. Pay capital gains taxes on earnings but can offset gains with losses.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies outside of your investment accounts.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - For longer-term goals, lean towards tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - For shorter-term goals, consider taxable accounts for flexibility.

5. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to maintain consistency and take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly reassess your investment strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies to fit your specific situation.
