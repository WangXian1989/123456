I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to manage symptoms.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests help track the progression of the disease.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Working with a nutritionist to tailor a diet that supports liver function can be beneficial.

5. **Advanced Treatments**: For severe cases, treatments like liver transplantation may be recommended.

Always consult with a healthcare professional before making decisions about your health.
