Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k):** Max out employer match first, as this is free money. Then consider contributing up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. If eligible, prioritize Roth for tax-free growth.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you'll need before retirement or for investments that generate low tax liabilities (e.g., index funds).

### 3. Diversify Investments
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. Evaluate Your Timeline
   - For long-term goals, prioritize retirement accounts. For short-term needs, keep more in taxable accounts for accessibility.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
A good starting point is to max out your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA, and finally use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
