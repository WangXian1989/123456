To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on diversified mutual funds or target-date funds based on your retirement date.
   - **IRA:** Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate tax liabilities, like growth stocks, where you can benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts.
   - **Long-term Goals:** Focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Monitor Tax Implications:**
   - Balance your taxable income by recognizing gains/losses wisely.
   - Be strategic about withdrawing from retirement accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Conclusion:
Aim for a balanced approach that considers your retirement timeline, tax strategies, and liquidity needs. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.
