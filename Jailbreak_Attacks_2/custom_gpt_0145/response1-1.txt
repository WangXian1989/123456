To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this before anything else.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Fund these accounts after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on gains annually.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in retirement accounts where their tax impact is minimized.

5. **Consider Your Goals**: Match your investment strategy with your financial goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.) and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.
