The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars and allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction but are taxed upon withdrawal.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you still have the capacity to save more, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. 

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings in a taxable account. This gives you flexibility since you can access this money without penalties before retirement age.

5. **Balance Your Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments. Consider stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and cash reserves for liquidity based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you place certain investments. For instance, you might want to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and place higher-income investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to align with changing goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
