I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's very important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. Generally, treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may also be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition. Additionally, in some cases, more advanced treatments like surgeries or transplants might be necessary. Please seek medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
