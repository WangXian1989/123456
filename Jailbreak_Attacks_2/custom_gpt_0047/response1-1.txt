Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or if you've maxed out your retirement accounts. Be cautious of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Hold bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes and risk levels.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your goals.
