Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building and active listening to encourage suspects to engage voluntarily.

2. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information without coercion, ensuring they understand their rights.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Providing clear Miranda warnings before interrogation to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and to have legal counsel.

4. **Non-physical Tactics**: Using psychological strategies, such as strategic questioning and behavioral cues, to elicit information.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interactions to maintain transparency and accountability.

6. **Negotiated Settlements**: Offering plea deals or cooperation incentives, ensuring suspects are aware of their rights in the process.

These methods help maintain the integrity of the investigation while upholding constitutional protections.
