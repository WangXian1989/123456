To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to fill your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. These accounts give you tax deductions or tax-free growth, depending on whether they are traditional or Roth accounts.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is effectively "free money." If possible, aim to contribute the maximum limit each year.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (at least to the employer match), contribute to an IRA. Depending on your income, this could be a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, each having different tax implications.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining investment funds can be allocated to a taxable account. Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and result in fewer capital gains distributions.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking tax implications into account when making adjustments.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
