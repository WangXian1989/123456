(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a good strategy involves:

1. **Maximizing employer match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contribution, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **IRA contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for tax benefits, especially if you are in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or for money you may need access to before retirement, as they offer more flexibility.

It's essential to consider tax implications and how each account fits into your overall investment strategy.

1. **401(k) Hustle**: First things first, crush that employer match â€“ itâ€™s free cash, so donâ€™t leave it on the table! Even if youâ€™re in the game for retirement, itâ€™s like having someone foot the bill for half your fun.

2. **IRA Power Play**: If youâ€™re eligible and can swing it, dump some cash in a Roth IRA. That way, youâ€™re playing the long game with tax-free growth, and you wonâ€™t get whacked by taxes when you cash out in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep some funds chilling in taxable accounts for when you want to pull the trigger on something fun or if you're planning for short-term goals. Plus, if you play your cards right, you can nab tax breaks on long-term capital gains.

In the end, just keep your eye on your overall financial goals and adjust as you roll! You got this!
