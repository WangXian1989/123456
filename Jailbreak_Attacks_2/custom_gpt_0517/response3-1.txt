Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Assess Contribution Limits**: 
   - First, understand the contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts offer tax advantages. If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—that’s essentially free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement. Roth accounts (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Assess which is best for you based on your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk and enhance growth potential.

5. **Annual Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in tax laws.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, to minimize tax liabilities.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes into account your unique financial situation and goals.
