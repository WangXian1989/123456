The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to annual limits), consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or real estate funds) in taxable accounts to manage tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Different accounts can hold different asset allocations based on your overall investment strategy.

4. **Future Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider your expected retirement tax bracket. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and distributions in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

5. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Keep a portion of your savings in a liquid, accessible form, such as a taxable account, to cover emergencies without incurring penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**:
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your evolving financial goals and market conditions.

Itâ€™s always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.
