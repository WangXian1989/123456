Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit—this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Note that withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains and dividends, which can eat into your returns. Use these accounts for investments you expect to hold for the long term.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified asset allocation across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It may be strategic to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Consider setting up automatic contributions to all accounts, focusing initially on those with the most favorable tax treatment.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Future Changes**: Stay informed about changes in tax laws and retirement account rules that may affect your strategy. 

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this guidance to your specific circumstances.
