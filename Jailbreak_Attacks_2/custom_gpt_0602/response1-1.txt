Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is effectively “free money.”
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Depending on eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023:
     - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50)
     - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)

### 3. **Assess Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Check the investment options and fees. If they’re limited or expensive, it might make sense to prioritize other accounts.
   - **IRAs/TAXABLE:** Offer a broader range of investments and can be used for tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexibility for withdrawals and no penalties for early access, but you pay capital gains tax on profits.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Focus on long-term growth since withdrawals may be taxed heavily (particularly with traditional accounts).

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance, with growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

### Example Breakdown
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** to take advantage of the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably a Roth if eligible) to benefit from tax-free growth.
- Use any remaining funds for a **taxable account**, focusing on investments that can benefit from favorable tax treatment, like index funds.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your portfolio and distribution strategy annually or after major life changes.

By balancing contributions based on these principles, you can optimize your investments effectively. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation!
