To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefitsâ€”such as tax-free growth for IRAs and potential employer matching for 401(k)s.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - For 2023, the maximum contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or over). Ensure you stay within these limits.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Investments in taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

4. **Invest Time Horizons**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments due to their tax advantages. Shorter-term savings or goals might be better suited for taxable accounts where you can access the funds more easily without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, maintain a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure alignment with your overall investment strategy.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation and goals.
