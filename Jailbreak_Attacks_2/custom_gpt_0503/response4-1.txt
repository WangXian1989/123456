To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals**: How far are you from retirement? 
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Are you comfortable with high-risk investments for potential growth, or do you prefer safer choices?

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**
   - **Dividing Investments**:
     - **401(k)**: Often has a limited selection of funds; diversify within those options (stocks, bonds, etc.).
     - **IRA**: More investment choices; allocate based on your strategy (e.g., larger proportions in equities if you're younger).
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable capital gains treatment, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. 

### 4. **Consider the Withdrawal Rules**
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties. Plan your investments accordingly to avoid needing these funds too soon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility for any immediate financial needs without penalties.

### 5. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Monitor your portfolio at least annually and adjust your contributions and allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
