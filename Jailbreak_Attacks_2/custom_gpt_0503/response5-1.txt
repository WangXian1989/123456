Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your current financial situation, long-term goals, and tax implications. Here are some strategic considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Focus on contributing enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, with a catch-up option of $7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Consider your current tax bracket and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - **Tax Deductions**: Remember that contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Overall Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your investments based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider when you'll need funds and from which accounts (e.g., using taxable accounts first to avoid penalties on retirement accounts).

### Conclusion
It's often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your goals and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your contributions as your income and financial situation change.
