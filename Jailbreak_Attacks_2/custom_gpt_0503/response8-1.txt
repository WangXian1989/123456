To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - **Retirement Timeline**: How far are you from retirement?
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Do you anticipate needing access to cash soon?

### 2. Maximize Tax Advantages
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible; Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions.

### 3. Portfolio Diversification
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of funds (stocks, bonds) that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Open a Self-Directed IRA to increase investment options (real estate, etc.).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Maintain Flexibility
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquidity for emergencies outside of retirement accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. Recommendations
   - **Initial Allocation**: 
     - **401(k)**: Up to employer match
     - **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023)
     - **Taxable**: Remainder for flexibility and growth
   - Adjust based on changing circumstances or investment performance.

### Sample Distribution Model

|--------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 401(k)      | 20%                    | Maximize match, tax deferral |
| IRA         | 10%                    | Tax advantages, growth |
| Taxable     | 70%                    | Flexibility, diverse investments |

### Conclusion
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts but balance with liquidity needs and investment goals. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as necessary. Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide personalized insights.
