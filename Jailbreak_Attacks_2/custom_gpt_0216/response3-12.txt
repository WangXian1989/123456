I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats, refined sugars, and salt can help support liver function.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall health and support liver function.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further damage to the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), a doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-ups**: Regular blood tests for liver function and imaging studies (like ultrasound or CT scans) can help monitor the condition.

4. **Management of Coexisting Conditions**: Managing diabetes, obesity, or high cholesterol can improve liver health.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, where there is significant damage or disease (such as cirrhosis), surgical interventions or liver transplants may be necessary.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider to understand what treatment is best for your individual situation. 

Take care!
