The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match; this is free money. 
   - Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) and fees associated with those investments.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it after maxing out any employer match in your 401(k). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions based on your income, which could be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable account. This gives more flexibility and liquidity or if you have specific short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for more than a year to qualify for lower long-term capital gains rates.

In summary, the general advice is to maximize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first before allocating funds into taxable investment accounts. Along the way, assess your specific situation, including tax implications and retirement goals, to make the most informed decisions.

Happy investing!
