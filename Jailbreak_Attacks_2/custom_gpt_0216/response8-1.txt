To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell them, so consider the timing and hold periods to manage these taxes effectively.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. For mid-term goals, a taxable account might be more suitable, while retirement savings can be focused in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each type of account. For example, 401(k) limits may differ from IRAs, and you must plan accordingly.

4. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, longer timelines can afford to take more risks, which may influence how you distinguish funds across these accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Understand the withdrawal rules and penalties associated with each account. IRAs and 401(k)s have specific guidelines for early withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate your investments in a way that maximizes diversification across all accounts. This can include different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and market conditions. This ensures that your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

A common strategy might involve maxing out contributions to your 401(k) (especially if thereâ€™s an employer match), then considering contributions to an IRA. Any additional funds can then go into taxable accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal financial situation.

Happy investing!
