To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money and sets a solid foundation for your retirement savings.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement) or a traditional IRA (tax-deductible now with taxes owed on withdrawals). If you're eligible for both, you might start with the one that aligns best with your tax strategy.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep track of annual contribution limits for IRAs and ensure you are maximizing your contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement. They offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals compared to retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer taxable events. Consider holding investments for more than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk. Consider bonds, stocks, and other assets depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your investment strategy and financial goals.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - **Consider Your Timeline**: Your age, retirement date, and financial goals will play a significant role in how you distribute your money. If you're far from retirement, you might prefer more aggressive growth investments, whereas, as you approach retirement, you might shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - **Professional Guidance**: It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that takes into account your unique situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By assessing your current financial situation and considering the tax implications, risk tolerances, and investment time horizons, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts.
