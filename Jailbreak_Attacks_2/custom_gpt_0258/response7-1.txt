To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies tailored to your financial goals and tax situation:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Max out any employer matching contributions first; it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a traditional 401(k) if you want to lower your taxable income, or a Roth 401(k) if you prefer to pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, provided your income allows it. If not, a traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep an eye on the contribution limits for each type of account to maximize your tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term savings goals or to invest in assets that may be taxed more favorably, such as long-term capital gains.
   - This account offers flexibility in withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

4. **Consideration of Asset Allocation**:
   - Place your higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since their growth will be tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - Reserve bonds and other interest-generating assets for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on income, as these can be taxed at higher ordinary income rates.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation in each account to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Every individual's financial situation is unique, so consulting a financial planner can help design a personalized strategy.

Ultimately, the best distribution depends on your retirement timeline, tax situation, risk tolerance, and financial goals. It's crucial to balance short-term needs with long-term growth potential.

Happy planning! ðŸ˜Š
