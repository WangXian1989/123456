To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors and strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement savings plan with tax advantages. Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Personal retirement account with tax advantages (Traditional vs. Roth). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts without tax advantages. Suitable for short- to medium-term goals or for investments you may need to access sooner.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA** contributions can reduce your taxable income in the contribution year.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made after-tax but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold.

3. **Evaluate Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term (buying a house, vacation) versus long-term goals (retirement).
   - Retirement accounts are better for long-term growth due to tax advantages, while taxable accounts can offer flexibility for shorter-term needs.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize growth in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.
   - Assess your comfort level with market fluctuations to decide on your overall investment strategy.

5. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to reduce risk.
   - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax impact.

6. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating to your IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

7. **Contribution Priorities**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your Roth IRA (if eligible) next due to its tax-free growth.
   - Then, return to the 401(k) to hit the maximum contribution limit if feasible.

8. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investment allocations based on performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your investment strategy, consider seeking personalized advice from a financial planner.

By understanding the characteristics of each account type and aligning your contributions with your financial goals and tax situation, you can effectively distribute your money among your investment accounts for optimal growth and efficiency. Happy investing!
