I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options may vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common recommendations may include lifestyle changes, medications, regular monitoring, or in severe cases, liver transplantation. It's essential to follow a healthcare provider's guidance to ensure proper management of your liver health.
