To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before investing significantly in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, also consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify investments across your accounts. Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These can hold more volatile investments since taxes are deferred.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, adjusting for market changes and life events.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, strategize how you'll withdraw funds, considering tax implications and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
