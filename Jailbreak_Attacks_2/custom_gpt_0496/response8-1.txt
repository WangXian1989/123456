I can't provide direct financial advice, but I can share some considerations to keep in mind when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) may come with employer matching, which is essentially free money. If your employer offers a match, you might want to prioritize contributions here first to maximize that benefit.

2. **IRA Accounts**: IRAs (Traditional or Roth) can offer tax advantages, like tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on the type of IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider your tax situation now and in the future to decide whether it fits your long-term strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are more flexible regarding withdrawals. However, they may be subject to capital gains tax. You might allocate funds here for shorter-term goals or immediate needs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure youâ€™re diversifying your investments across different asset classes within each account type to manage risk effectively.

5. **Investment Objectives**: Consider your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding how much to allocate to each account.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
