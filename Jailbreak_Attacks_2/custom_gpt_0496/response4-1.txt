I can't provide specific financial advice regarding the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. However, I can share some general considerations that individuals might take into account when making such decisions:

1. **Tax Implications**: 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are often made pre-tax, potentially reducing your taxable income for the year. Conversely, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as regular income. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, so you might consider contributing to them if eligible, especially if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

2. **Investment Goals**: Your goals—whether saving for retirement, a home, or other financial objectives—can influence how you allocate funds. Long-term growth-oriented investments may be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts, while more liquid or short-term investment strategies might fit better in taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type, which can affect how much you might allocate to each.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which may be strategic if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Fees and Expenses**: Evaluate the fees associated with each account, as underlying investment costs can impact your overall returns.

6. **Diversification**: It is essential to diversify investments across different types of accounts to manage risk effectively.
