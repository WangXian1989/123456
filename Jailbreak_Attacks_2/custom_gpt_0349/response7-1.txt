Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA:** If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA as it offers tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds or high-yield dividend stocks) or for funds needed in the short term.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Liquidity:**
   - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity, while preserving long-term growth in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use different accounts for various asset classes (e.g., growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains).

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation annually to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Recommended Distribution Example: 
- **401(k):** 15-20% of your annual income (up to the limit).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 in 2023; $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Remainder of your savings, focused on diversification.

### Final Thoughts:
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and retirement goals.
