Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is effectively free money and boosts your retirement savings.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If your income allows, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investments that may generate capital gains. This allows for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) across all accounts. Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - Be mindful of tax implications. Taxes on withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) can affect your overall returns in retirement.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to keep your allocations aligned with your financial goals.

### Conclusion
This approach maximizes tax-advantaged savings while ensuring flexibility. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
