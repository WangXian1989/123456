Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, contribution limits, and your investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After reaching the employer match, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit ($24,000 for 2024, $30,000 if over 50).

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexible withdrawal options.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, and keep lower-growth investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Annually**:
   - Regularly reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, financial goals, and tax laws.
