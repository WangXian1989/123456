Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment's growth and manage taxes efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of strategies for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider a traditional 401(k) to defer taxes. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth 401(k) can be more beneficial.
   - **Investment Options**: Typically, 401(k) plans offer limited investment choices. Diversify within those options based on your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Similar to a 401(k), if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be better. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it advantageous if you expect higher taxes later.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - **Broader Investment Choices**: IRAs usually offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, allowing you to diversify more effectively.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Short-term Goals**: These accounts are best for money you might need within the next few years since they don’t carry the same withdrawal penalties as retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Be aware of the tax implications when selling investments.
   - **Dividend Strategies**: Consider reinvesting dividends to compound your returns, but also be mindful of taxes on those dividends.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively funding retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your overall risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation or retirement goals.

### Suggested Contribution Order:
1. **401(k)** (up to the match)
2. **IRA** (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation)
3. **Max out 401(k)** contributions (if feasible)
4. **Taxable account** for additional savings or investments beyond retirement accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your individual financial situation and retirement goals.
