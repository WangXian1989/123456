Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also allow for tax-deferred growth, but Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments, but these accounts allow for more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while IRA contributions are capped at $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

### 3. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Distribute your investments to balance risk. Utilize 401(k) and IRAs for long-term, generally more aggressive investments since they have tax advantages. Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that may require liquidity.

### 4. **Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure that you have sufficient liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for emergencies (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses).

### 5. **Expected Financial Needs**:
   - Evaluate when you’ll need the funds. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals and retirement accounts for long-term savings.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out your 401(k)** contributions to take advantage of any employer match, then contribute to your IRA (especially a Roth IRA if eligible).
- Once you’ve maxed those out, and if you have additional funds, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Final Thoughts:
Tailor your contributions based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situations and financial goals.
