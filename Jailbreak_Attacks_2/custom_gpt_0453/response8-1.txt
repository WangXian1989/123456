To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions lower your taxable income, and the investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA could be a better choice.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk. Your asset allocation may depend on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** 
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as markets fluctuate and your investment goals evolve.

6. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts. Also, tax-loss harvesting can help offset gains.

7. **Emergency Fund:** 
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have a separate emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can help tailor a plan to your specific financial situation, taking into account your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth potential while considering tax implications and your long-term financial goals.
