Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now or to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - Consider your current vs. future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate capital gains, as youâ€™ll be taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.
   - Invest in index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes and fees.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Consider the type of investments (stocks, bonds) based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from the 401(k) and traditional IRA after age 73. Use taxable accounts first if you can to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocation as needed based on performance and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your goals and situation.
