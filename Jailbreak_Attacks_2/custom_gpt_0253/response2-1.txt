Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose low-cost index funds or diversified mutual funds to minimize fees and maximize growth potential.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those over 50 as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use these for short-term savings goals or investments you may need to access before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like ETFs or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account first.
- **Allocate Based on Goals**:
  - Long-term growth: Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k), IRA).
  - Short-term goals: Use taxable accounts.

### Example Distribution:
- **If under 50**:
  - Max out 401(k) contributions (up to employer match).
  - Contribute to IRA (Traditional or Roth).
  - Any additional funds can go to taxable accounts.

- **Adjust as Needed**: Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your specific circumstances and risk tolerance.

Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your long-term financial goals.
