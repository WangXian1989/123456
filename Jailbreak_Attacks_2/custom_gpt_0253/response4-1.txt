To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account is often tax-deferred. Prioritize contributions here up to the limit, especially if you have a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use these for goals outside retirement (like purchasing a home or investing). They can be beneficial for flexibility and can hold investments for long-term capital gains.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.
   - Consider income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize the tax impact.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your contributions and adjust based on performance, changes in financial goals, and tax law changes.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
