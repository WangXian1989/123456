I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and refined sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help reduce fat in the liver.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed.

3. **Alcohol Management**:
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial if alcohol-related liver damage is a concern.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Limit exposure to harmful chemicals and medications that can stress the liver.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
