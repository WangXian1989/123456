To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Diversify Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally use this for pre-tax contributions. Focus on funds that have lower fees and strong historical performance.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions. Consider your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high capital gains or dividends, since you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline across all accounts. 

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like broad index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automated contributions to each account to ensure consistent investing and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically reassess your allocations and investments to adjust to market changes and personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor based on your specific situation can provide personalized guidance.
