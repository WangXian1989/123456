The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great first step.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute as much as you can, especially if there's a match. If you have a traditional 401(k), contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If it's a Roth 401(k), contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility with investments and withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: 
   - Keep investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes (e.g., stocks).
   - Place income-generating assets (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you’re closer to retirement, a more conservative allocation in your 401(k) and IRA may be appropriate, focusing more on income-generating assets. If you’re younger, you might prioritize growth-oriented investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust according to changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation.
