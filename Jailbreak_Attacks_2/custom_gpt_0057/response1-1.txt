To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA) are beneficial for reducing taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth accounts allow tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, typically using a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents tailored for each account type.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some money in taxable accounts for immediate access without penalties, especially for short-term goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distribution and rebalance periodically to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure about your specific situation, a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your overall financial picture.

Always consider your long-term goals and current financial situation when making these decisions.
