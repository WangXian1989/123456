I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general options for liver problems. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function tests.

4. **Supplements**: Some doctors recommend liver-supporting supplements (like milk thistle), but consult your doctor first.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or liver transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss the best course of action with a healthcare professional.
