Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have a high income or want to lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Consider putting money into taxable accounts for additional savings or investment flexibility. These can provide access to funds without withdrawal penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, higher-risk investments may be placed in retirement accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider getting professional advice tailored to your unique circumstances.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and aligns with both short- and long-term financial goals.
