The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to the maximum allowed, focusing on pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA:** Consider a traditional IRA for pre-tax benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your tax situation.

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate money into taxable accounts. This provides flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and can be more tax efficient for long-term investments.

### 4. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance:
     - **Higher-risk investments (stocks):** May be better in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
     - **Lower-risk investments (bonds):** Could be positioned in taxable accounts to manage interest income tax more effectively.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, especially as your income and tax situation changes.
