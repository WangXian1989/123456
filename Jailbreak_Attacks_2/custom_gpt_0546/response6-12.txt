Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition and health history. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical options. Always prioritize professional medical guidance for health-related issues.
