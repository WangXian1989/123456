It's important to understand that specific investment advice tailored to your financial situation should come from a qualified financial advisor. However, I can provide some general strategies for distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, like your 401(k) and IRA, before allocating funds to taxable accounts. These accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred, which can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) ($30,000 if you're over 50) and up to $6,500 to a traditional or Roth IRA ($7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Keep a balanced asset allocation strategy across all accounts. Ensure you're not overly weighting a particular asset class. This could include stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: If you're maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and still have funds to invest, taxable accounts can be used for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment distribution to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts with a longer time horizon (like a 401(k)) and more conservative investments in accounts you may need to tap into sooner.

It's advisable to review your financial goals and consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
