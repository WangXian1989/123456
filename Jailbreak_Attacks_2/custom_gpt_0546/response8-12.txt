I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized medical advice. Treatments can vary widely based on the specific condition, but common approaches may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant. Please seek medical guidance for an accurate assessment and treatment plan.
