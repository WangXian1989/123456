Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Tax Advantages
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth), especially if you qualify for tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. Assess Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you might need access to before retirement. Keep in mind, capital gains taxes apply to investments here.

### 4. Diversify Investments
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to balance risk and growth potential.

### 5. Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance
   - Younger individuals might prefer riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift to more conservative options.

### 6. Regular Review
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on market changes, life events, or shifts in financial goals.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation. This will help ensure that you're maximizing growth while managing risk effectively.
