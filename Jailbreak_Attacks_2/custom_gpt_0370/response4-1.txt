Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Here’s a streamlined approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing up to the annual limit in an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for diversification and liquidity.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, index funds) due to tax deferral benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

5. **Rebalance and Review**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations to align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

Always assess your individual financial situation, goals, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
