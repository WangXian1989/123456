I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can help reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying causes.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests can help manage your condition better.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis, surgical options or liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Herbal Supplements**: Some people explore options like milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
