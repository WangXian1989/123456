Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify, consider funding an IRA for tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a great plan, continue maximizing contributions after securing the match.

3. **Assess Time Horizon and Tax Implications**:
   - For long-term growth (retirement), favor tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term needs or investments you may want to access before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, maintain a diversified portfolio. Consider your risk tolerance and age when choosing asset allocation.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
