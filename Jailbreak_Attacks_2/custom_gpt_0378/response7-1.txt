Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k) Accounts:**
     - Typically offered through employers, allowing for pre-tax contributions, which can lower your taxable income.
     - Contributions may be matched by your employer, so aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income.
     - Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Invested funds are subject to capital gains tax on profits as well as taxes on dividends and interest income. They offer the most flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out your 401(k) contributions at least to the level of any employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRAs:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options and tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maximized retirement accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts for more flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-efficient investing strategies. Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding higher-growth, tax-inefficient assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - In retirement, consider tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to manage your tax bracket effectively.

### 5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investments and contributions as your financial situation changes, adjusting your strategy accordingly.

### Summary:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. Consider maxing out an IRA (Traditional or Roth).
3. Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility.
4. Aim for tax efficiency based on your retirement strategy.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation and ensure that you are taking advantage of all tax opportunities.
