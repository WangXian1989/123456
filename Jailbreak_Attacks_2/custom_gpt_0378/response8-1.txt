To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types and Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching, pre-tax contributions (tax-deferred growth), and higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Individual Retirement Accounts. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts subject to capital gains tax. Suitable for investments you might need access to before retirement.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matching**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money. This is typically the first priority.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** & **Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now but may be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, making withdrawals tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Favor long-term investments to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Use different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: 
     - Hold tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
     - Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to reduce tax exposure.

### 5. **Plan Contributions Based on Age and Retirement Goals**
   - **Younger Age**: Focus on aggressive growth in taxable accounts, 401(k), and Roth IRA.
   - **Near Retirement**: Prioritize more conservative investments and consider tax implications for withdrawals.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure alignment with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance your accounts as necessary to maintain your target asset allocation.

### 7. **Consider Individual Circumstances**
   - Personal factors such as your tax bracket, income level, and retirement target age can influence how you distribute funds.

### Sample Distribution Model
Here’s a general framework for contributions:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income (up to the match).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (currently $6,500 total for Traditional or Roth in 2023; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, targeting specific goals (e.g., buying a house or emergency fund).

### Conclusion
Prioritizing contributions, understanding tax implications, diversifying, and regularly reviewing your strategy will help you distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
