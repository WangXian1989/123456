Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available—it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions as well, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks might be better suited for long-term accounts (like retirement accounts) due to their potential for growth, while bonds or more conservative investments could be appropriate for taxable accounts, depending on your income and tax implications.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you need access to cash in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts since early withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can reduce risk and improve potential returns over time.

6. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment performance.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific situation.
