Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here are some strategies to help you decide the best allocation:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs may have tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invested after-tax income; gains are taxed as capital gains when realized.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first.
   - Then, contribute to your IRA (traditional or Roth), keeping in mind annual contribution limits.
   - After you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Focus on high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid capital gains taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxes, like qualified dividends or municipal bonds, to minimize your tax burden.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your investment horizon. Long-term goals may favor more aggressive investments in retirement accounts, while shorter-term goals might require more liquidity found in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sector exposures tailored to your risk tolerance.

6. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - A common approach is to allocate a percentage of your total investable assets among these accounts, keeping in mind the specific investment strategy for each one.

7. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile, especially as market conditions change or as you approach retirement.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your individual financial situation and goals.
