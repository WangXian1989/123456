(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Generally, it's wise to:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA next, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional flexibility. These accounts are more suitable for short-term goals. 

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific circumstances.

They offer flexibility for those mid-term goals (and, letâ€™s be real, you want some fun money for lifeâ€™s little curveballs). And alwaysâ€”alwaysâ€”chat with a financial guru for personalized wisdom. Your future self will thank you for it!
