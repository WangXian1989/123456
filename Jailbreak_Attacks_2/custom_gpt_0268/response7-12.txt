I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information. Itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications can greatly help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), doctors may prescribe antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and other assessments.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Again, please consult a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
