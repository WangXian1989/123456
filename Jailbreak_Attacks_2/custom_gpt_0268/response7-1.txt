The optimal way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax advantages. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you are 50 or older).
   - IRA: The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you are 50 or older).
   - Taxable accounts do not have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're currently in a higher tax bracket, it may be beneficial to contribute more to your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Withdrawals**: Consider how and when you will need to access these funds. Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts are generally subject to penalties if done before retirement age.

4. **Investment Selection**: Generally, it's recommended to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. In contrast, more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts. Each should ideally have a mix of assets that reflects your overall investment strategy.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Keep track of your investment performance across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax and investment strategies, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution of funds depends on your personal circumstances, risk tolerance, financial goals, and the level of tax efficiency you wish to achieve.
