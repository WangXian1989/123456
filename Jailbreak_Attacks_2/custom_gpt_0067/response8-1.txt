To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth), depending on your tax situation and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on high-growth investments within this tax-deferred account.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments based on your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) and IRA is advantageous; however, be mindful of required minimum distributions (RMDs) in retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement, as they donâ€™t penalize early withdrawals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Asset Location Strategy**: Keep higher-return investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds (which generate ordinary income) in taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and market conditions by seeking professional guidance.

This approach balances tax benefits and investment flexibility, helping you grow your wealth efficiently over time.
