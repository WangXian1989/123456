To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maxing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Investment Choices**:
   - Higher-growth investments may be better for tax-advantaged accounts where you won't be taxed annually on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or those generating regular income to minimize tax impact.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place bonds and dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter income from taxes.
   - Hold stocks in taxable accounts for potentially lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications in retirement. Understand required minimum distributions (RMDs) for your 401(k) and Traditional IRA.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals across all accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation or tax laws change. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
