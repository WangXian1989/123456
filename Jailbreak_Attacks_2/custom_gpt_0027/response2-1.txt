When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax benefits. Consider direct Roth conversions if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Allocate different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Liquidity Needs:**
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs and emergencies.

5. **Annual Contributions:**
   - Regularly contribute to all three accounts, prioritizing those with higher tax benefits first.

6. **Assess Withdrawals:**
   - Plan for withdrawals in retirement: often, itâ€™s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and last from tax-free accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your individual situation.
