To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) or IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred. Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize tax burdens.
   - **Long-term Investments**: Taxable accounts can hold assets you plan to hold for the long term, allowing potential capital gains to be taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing risk and potential returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. This impacts your tax bracket and overall financial health.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly reassess your strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
