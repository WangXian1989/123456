I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options often depend on the specific condition, but may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, procedures such as surgery. Always seek medical guidance for accurate diagnosis and treatment plans.
