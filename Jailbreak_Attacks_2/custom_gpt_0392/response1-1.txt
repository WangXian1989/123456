Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Often have employer matches, tax-deferred growth.
   - **Strategy**: Max out any employer match first; it's essentially free money.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, grows tax-deferred. Withdrawals taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Strategy**: Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Flexibility and access to funds at any time; can take advantage of capital gains taxes.
   - **Strategy**: Use for investments that may generate income (interest or dividends) that don't need to be accessed soon.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs before taxable accounts.
   
2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have adequate savings outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon within each account.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Monitor your allocations and adjust as necessary based on performance and changing goals.

### **Example Allocation**
- 401(k): Maximize contributions, including matching.
- IRA: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA after maximizing 401(k) contributions.
- Taxable: Once youâ€™ve funded the above, allocate additional savings here.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
