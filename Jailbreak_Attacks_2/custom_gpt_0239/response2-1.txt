Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement age. This allows for more liquidity without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to take advantage of capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adjusting for performance and contributions.

### 6. **Consider Fees and Investment Options**
   - Evaluate the investment options and fees associated with each account type to optimize your returns.

### 7. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - As you approach retirement, strategize about which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes and maximize your retirement funds.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out the IRA contributions, prioritizing the type based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest surplus funds, focusing on tax-efficient securities.
