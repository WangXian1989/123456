To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a basic breakdown of each account type to help inform your decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - **Pros**: Often have employer matching contributions, which is essentially “free money.” Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment options depending on your employer’s plan and potential penalties for early withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and the money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Pros**: More investment options than a 401(k) and potential tax benefits.
   - **Cons**: Income limits for Roth contributions and penalties for early withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: Flexibility in withdrawals without penalties and no contribution limits. You can invest in a wide range of assets.
   - **Cons**: Capital gains taxes apply to profits when you sell investments, which can affect your overall returns.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as this is an immediate return on investment.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you have access to a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to this next. A Roth is particularly advantageous for younger savers who expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, you can go back to your 401(k) and contribute more, especially if your employer offers a high match.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investment goals that are shorter-term (like saving for a house) or for additional retirement savings once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Timeline**: Younger investors might favor Roth IRAs for tax-free growth, while older investors nearing retirement may lean towards Traditional IRAs or maximizing their 401(k).
- **Tax Bracket**: Understanding your current and projected future tax brackets can help you decide whether to prioritize pre-tax or post-tax accounts.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy in all accounts to mitigate risks and enhance growth potential.

It’s always good to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals. Happy Coding!
