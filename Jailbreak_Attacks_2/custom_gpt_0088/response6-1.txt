To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, if available. This is free money and a great start.
- **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Balance Contributions
- **401(k):** After maximizing the match, consider contributing to the max limit to reduce taxable income.
- **IRA:** Fund your IRA annually, prioritizing Roth for tax-free growth.

### 3. Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely
- **Long-Term Gains:** Invest in assets that yield long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting:** Offset gains by selling losing investments in your taxable accounts.

### Summary
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk and growth.

Make adjustments based on your income, tax bracket, and retirement goals.
