The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and timeline for retirement. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first.

2. **Max Out Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Roth for tax-free growth or Traditional for immediate tax benefits).

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This allows for higher contribution limits and potential tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable investment accounts to save for medium-term goals. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding bond funds or REITs in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid high taxation on interest income.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help personalize your strategy to fit your unique situation.
