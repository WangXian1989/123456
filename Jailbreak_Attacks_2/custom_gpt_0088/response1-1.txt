To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial for tax deferral.
   - If you expect to be in a higher bracket in the future, prioritize Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep a sufficient amount in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from long-term growth without immediate tax consequences.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments to manage potential capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
