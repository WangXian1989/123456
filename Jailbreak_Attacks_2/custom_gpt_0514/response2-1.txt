When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies to optimize your tax efficiency and long-term growth:

1. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Take advantage of employer matches in your 401(k).

2. **Prioritize Your 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

3. **Maximize IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for post-tax growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you're not eligible, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for assets you may need before retirement. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains. Utilize bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts for potential tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Plan withdrawals strategically for tax efficiency in retirement.

A tailored approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon is essential. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
