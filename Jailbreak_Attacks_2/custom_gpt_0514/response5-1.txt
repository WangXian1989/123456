(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax benefits that can enhance your savings growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for investments that might benefit from more liquidity or that have favorable capital gains treatment, like stocks held for over a year.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Your investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) should vary between these accounts based on the tax implications. For example, higher-growth investments may be better suited for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, market conditions, and personal financial goals.

1. **401(k) First**: Max out that 401(k) if your employer matchesâ€”free money doesnâ€™t grow on trees! Shove as much in there as you can, up to the limit. Take full advantage of the match like itâ€™s a Black Friday sale.

2. **IRA is Your Friend**: After nailing the 401(k), toss some cash into your IRA. Roth if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later, traditional if you want a break now. Just pick one and make it work!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Don't sleep on taxable accounts. These are for when you want some access to cash without waiting until retirement. Plus, you get the perk of lower long-term capital gains taxes on what you hold over a year.

4. **Asset Balance is Key**: Play around with what you hold where. Put higher-yield stocks that can get taxed heavily in the IRA/401(k), and keep your boring bond stuff in taxable accounts for some easygoing returns.

5. **Keep It Fluid**: Life changes, man! Review your strategy yearly. Adjust based on new goals, income changes, or market fluctuations. Your financial game should adapt like your favorite video game character.

Mix it up and keep it smart!
