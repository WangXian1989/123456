When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to reduce your taxable income now.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments aimed at long-term growth, like stocks or ETFs, which benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs**: Allocate funds in taxable accounts for investments you might need access to sooner, like bonds or cash equivalents.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Roth IRA Considerations**: If you have a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Tax Bracket Management**: In retirement, strategically withdraw from accounts to manage your tax bracket effectively.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Always stay within contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, for example, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500, and the IRA limit is $6,500.

5. **Rebalancing and Diversification**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

Before making any decisions, consider your individual financial situation, goals, and consult with a financial advisor if necessary.
