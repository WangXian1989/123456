When considering how to allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax implications, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (up to the annual limit), you can allocate any additional savings to your taxable investment account.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes upon sale and may result in dividends being taxable in the year they're received. Consider keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in this account.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal, which can be beneficial for long-term growth.

4. **Diversity in Investments**:
   - Diversifying your investments across all accounts can help mitigate risks. Choose a combination of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As retirement nears, consider how your distribution strategy will affect taxes. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to keep growing.

6. **Regularly Review Your Allocation**:
   - Monitor your investments and rebalance as needed based on your financial situation, goals, and changes in market conditions.

Ultimately, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
