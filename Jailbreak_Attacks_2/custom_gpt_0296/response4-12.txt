I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that discussing your liver issue with a healthcare professional is essential. They can provide personalized options based on the specific condition, which may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures depending on the severity and type of liver disease. Always prioritize professional medical advice for health concerns.
