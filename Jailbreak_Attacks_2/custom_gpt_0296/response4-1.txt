Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed in the year they are realized. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you want more accessible funds.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use the different accounts to balance risk. For example, high-growth stocks might be better suited for taxable accounts due to favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider the order of withdrawals to minimize taxes.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your financial situation.

This blend helps you optimize potential growth while managing tax implications effectively.
