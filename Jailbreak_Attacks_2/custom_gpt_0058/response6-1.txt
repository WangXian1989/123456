To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to rise in the future, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals; tax implications differ between account types, which can impact your overall retirement strategy.

By strategically utilizing these accounts, you can optimize your savings and investment growth while minimizing your tax burden over time.
