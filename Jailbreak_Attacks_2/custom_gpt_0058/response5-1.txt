(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. Generally, it’s wise to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA. Consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Fund taxable accounts for investment flexibility and access to funds before retirement age.

Consider reviewing your asset allocation periodically and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k) First**: Dump enough into your 401(k) to snag that sweet employer match—don't leave free cash on the table! It’s like free pizza at a party; you gotta grab it!
