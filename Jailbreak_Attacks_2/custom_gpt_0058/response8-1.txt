Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute to your 401(k) at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your IRA and 401(k) before putting money into taxable accounts.

3. **IRA Choice**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, keep this in mind.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like index funds or long-term investments with capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation regularly and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
