Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Consider maxing it out if you can, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Prefer to hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize immediate tax liabilities.
   - Place investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk effectively. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, focus on growth investments (stocks).
- **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible for tax-free growth; otherwise, use a traditional IRA for tax deferral.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest in lower-risk, income-generating assets or tax-managed funds.

### Conclusion
Assess your personal circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for customized advice tailored to your goals and tax situation.
