I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver treatment options. Generally, treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in more severe cases, procedures like liver transplant. Please discuss your concerns with a medical expert who can provide tailored guidance based on your specific condition.
