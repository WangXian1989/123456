(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Generally, the following strategy can be applied:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). If your income permits, a Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional savings into a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing the funds without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Ensure your investments reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger investors may favor more aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement might opt for conservative investments.

It's recommended to periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, life events, or shifts in financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! When it comes to spreading your cash around like peanut butter on toast between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, thereâ€™s some solid moves to make. 

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer's throwing in some sweet matching contributions, you gotta snag that first! Itâ€™s like finding extra fries at the bottom of the bagâ€”score! 

2. **IRA Game**: Then, consider maxing out that IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, you should snatch it up because who doesnâ€™t like the idea of tax-free withdrawals when youâ€™re old and wise? 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve tackled those retirement accounts, letâ€™s hit up the taxable accounts next. They give you more flexibility, kinda like choosing what to binge-watch on Netflixâ€”taxes are just something you can deal with later, right?

4. **Donâ€™t Forget Asset Allocation**: And hey, donâ€™t just throw everything in cheesy tech stocks. Balance it out! If youâ€™re young, go heavy on those high-reward stocks, and if youâ€™re closer to retirement, consider adding some bonds and safer stuff to weather the market freakouts. 

Make sure to keep your eyes on your investments and re-evaluate when those life curveballs hit you!
