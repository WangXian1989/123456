I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment mostly depends on the underlying cause of the liver issue. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Medications**: Specific medications may help treat liver conditions, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Incorporating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help manage conditions like fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation or surgery to remove tumors might be required.

Again, please speak with a healthcare provider for advice that fits your specific situation.
