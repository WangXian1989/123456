When considering the optimal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it is essential to evaluate a few critical factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a framework to help you allocate your assets effectively:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Ensure you are contributing enough to receive any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings that you may need in the short to medium term. Investments in taxable accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility than retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-managed funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Short-term Savings**: Keep 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account or a money market fund.
- **Retirement Accounts**: 
  - Max out your 401(k) contributions first, especially to take advantage of employer match.
  - After maxing out the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional savings into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Regular Review and Adjustment:
- Regularly assess the performance of your investments and make adjustments based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and tax considerations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and objectives.
