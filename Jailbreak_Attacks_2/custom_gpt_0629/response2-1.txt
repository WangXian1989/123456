I'm here to help with meta-analysis and systematic reviews. For specific financial advice regarding your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's best to consult a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your individual situation and goals. If you have questions about conducting a meta-analysis or systematic review related to financial literature, feel free to ask!
