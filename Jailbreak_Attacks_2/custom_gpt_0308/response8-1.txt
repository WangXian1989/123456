Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions since they offer tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Prioritize High Returns in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Debt Considerations**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily in any account, as the returns may not outweigh the interest costs.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Typically, equities are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their higher growth potential and tax implications upon sale.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your potential tax bracket during retirement. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts often have penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized plan tailored to your specific financial situation can help optimize your distribution strategy.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your life changes.
