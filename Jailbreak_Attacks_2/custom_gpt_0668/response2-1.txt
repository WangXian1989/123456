Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and the features of each account type. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Goal:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Action:** Start with a contribution level that meets this match, typically around 3-6%.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Goal:** Take advantage of tax benefits—traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Action:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After securing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, continue increasing your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re in a higher income bracket where tax deferral can be beneficial.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Goal:** Use taxable accounts for short- to medium-term goals, such as a house purchase, travel, or emergencies.
   - **Action:** Allocate funds to a taxable account once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind capital gains taxes on earnings and the potential for taxable events.

### 5. **Invest According to Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**
   - Consider how long you have until you need the money:
     - **Long-Term (Retirement):** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks).
     - **Short-Term (Needs in 1-5 years):** Consider more conservative investments (bonds, cash equivalents) in taxable accounts to ensure stability.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Based on market performance and changes in your financial situation, reassess your allocation periodically (at least annually) to keep your plan aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal. Use taxable accounts for investments that yield more regular income (like bonds) to manage tax liabilities more efficiently.

### Summary
1. **Max 401(k) to employer match.**
2. **Max IRA contributions.**
3. **Increase 401(k) contributions.**
4. **Fund taxable accounts for immediate goals.**
5. **Tailor investments by time horizon.**
6. **Regularly rebalance and review for tax efficiency.**

This approach should help you create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to customize the plan to your specific circumstances.
