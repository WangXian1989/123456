Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) for tax purposes, but Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains, which can be less favorable than tax-deferred accounts.

### 2. **Allocate Based on Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals (less than 5 years):** Consider holding money in taxable accounts for easier access, while potentially using high-yield savings or conservative investments.
   - **Long-Term Goals (5+ years):** Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions to maximize tax advantages and growth potential.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**
   - Aim to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Fully fund your IRA (or at least a portion) each year, considering the limits for contributions.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investment choices (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) according to your risk tolerance and market outlook.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with changing life circumstances, market conditions, and financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that maximizes your wealth while considering tax effects and accessibility.
