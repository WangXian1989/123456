Distributing your money wisely among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for maximizing your retirement savings and minimizing taxes. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Tax Treatment:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often pre-tax (reducing your taxable income), and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. Check employer matching options to maximize contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs have similar tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Use these accounts for more flexible spending and to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA up to the limit.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing excess funds in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRAs:** Focus on long-term investments, such as stocks and balanced funds, since taxes will apply upon withdrawal, especially in Traditional accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider municipal bonds, index funds, or ETFs to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains. Tax-loss harvesting can also be beneficial.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - In retirement, consider the sequence of withdrawals carefully. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, potentially delaying withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts until necessary.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market performance, contribution limits, and tax laws. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket:** Monitor your tax bracket when making decisions on withdrawals and contributions.
- **Financial Goals:** Align your investment strategy with your overall financial goals and timeline for withdrawals.
