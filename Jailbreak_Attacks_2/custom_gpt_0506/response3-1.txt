Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re in a high tax bracket and your employer offers matching contributions, this should be your priority.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA reduce your taxable income now but are taxed when you withdraw in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on investment profits.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across each account type to balance risk and return. Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Lifetime Strategy**: 
   - As retirement approaches, consider shifting more investments into safer assets (like bonds) within tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Withdraw funds from taxable accounts first in retirement to keep tax brackets lower.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations to adjust for changes in goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
- **IRA**: Invest in a Roth IRA for long-term growth (if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Add any additional savings for short-term goals or emergency funds.
