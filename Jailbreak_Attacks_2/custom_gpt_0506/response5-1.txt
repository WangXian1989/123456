Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Account:**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Roth IRA Consideration:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA:** You may also contribute to a Traditional IRA for additional tax deductions, particularly if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may be needed before retirement age, or for goals with shorter time horizons.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **First**, contribute to your 401(k) up to the match.
- **Next**, fund a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA to maximize tax-advantaged growth.
- **Finally**, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
