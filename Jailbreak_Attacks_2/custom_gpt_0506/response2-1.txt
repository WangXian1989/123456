Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**:
     - Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
     - Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Income and gains are taxed as they are realized, so be mindful of capital gains tax.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for long-term investments to benefit from compound growth and tax-free growth potential.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more towards your taxable account for easier access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching; it’s essentially free money.
   - Contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) contributions, keeping in mind the contribution limits.

### 4. **Diversity**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Account Type Strategy**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your changing financial situation.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match first.
   - Aim for max contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - Max out contributions next ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).
   - Consider the Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you’re eligible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest any additional savings after maxing out contributions to retirement accounts.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to manage gains effectively.
