To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. If you qualify, aim for the max contribution here as well.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Focus on investments with lower turnover to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate different types of investments based on the account type. For example, consider holding bonds or less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts for better long-term capital gains treatment.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market performance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and goals.

By following this approach, you can maximize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
