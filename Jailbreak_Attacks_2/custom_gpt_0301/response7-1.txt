Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or long-term stocks. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Invest in a mix of equities and bonds across all accounts, but consider your age and risk tolerance. Generally, younger investors may lean more towards stocks.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in risk tolerance, or life events.

### 5. **Stay Informed on Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your strategy accordingly.

### Summary
Start with maxing out employer contributions and then your IRA before allocating funds to taxable accounts, balancing growth and risk as needed.
