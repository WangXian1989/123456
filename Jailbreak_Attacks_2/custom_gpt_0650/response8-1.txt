To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Employer-Sponsored Plans**:
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any available employer match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - Aim for at least 15% of your salary, including employer contributions if possible.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider funding an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, the Roth option might be more beneficial.

3. **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds that minimize capital gains distributions, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. 
   - Place higher-growth investments (which may generate capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your target asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances, such as your age, income level, and retirement goals, can greatly impact the best strategy for you. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

Always assess your financial situation and adjust your strategy as necessary.
