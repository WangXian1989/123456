Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if financially feasible, keeping in mind the annual limit.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility requirements.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts, like individual stocks or bonds.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **General Allocation Tips**:
   - **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement for tax efficiency.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider discussing with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific situation.

By balancing contributions based on employer benefits, tax implications, and investment goals, you can make the most of each account type.
