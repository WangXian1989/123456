Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Best for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Identify short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds), as youâ€™ll pay taxes on income but can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes during retirement, using tax-deferred accounts first, then taxable accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
