The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, itâ€™s wise to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA because they offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for example, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

4. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account, ensure you're diversifying your investments to spread risk. This might mean investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly reassess your investment strategy and adjust your contributions as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy tailored to your financial goals and circumstances.

Each person's situation is unique, so the best strategy aligns with your financial objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
