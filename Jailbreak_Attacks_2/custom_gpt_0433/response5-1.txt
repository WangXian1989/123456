(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, you might consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a matching program, as this is essentially free money. After that, you can contribute to an IRA, which offers tax advantages. If you have additional funds after maximizing these options, you can invest in taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments, but may be subject to capital gains taxes.
