Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Contribute to 401(k) First (Especially if There's a Match)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and is a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The contribution limits for 2023 are $6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

3. **Back to 401(k) for Maximum Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, you can then put more money into your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit, which is $22,500 for individuals under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you still have funds to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. This is especially useful if you want more liquidity or to invest for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk. Typically, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, while keeping safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications. For example, interest and short-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates, whereas qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at reduced rates.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your investment allocation and goals, and make adjustments as needed based on performance, market conditions, or changes to your financial situation.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
