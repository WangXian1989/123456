Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions if feasible.
  
2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide if you want a Roth IRA (taxes paid now, tax-free withdrawals later) or a Traditional IRA (tax deductions now, taxes later). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs ($6,500 for 2023 or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts provide more liquidity and flexibility than retirement accounts, as you can access your funds without penalties at any time.
   - **Investment Choices:** You can invest in a wider range of securities, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before aggressively investing.
- **Prioritize Accounts Based on Goals:**
  - If long-term retirement growth is your goal, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA first.
  - Once you reach the contribution limits for these accounts, allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts.

### Evaluate Your Situation:
- **Time Horizon:** If retirement is decades away, you may want more money in growth-oriented accounts (like 401(k) and IRA).
- **Risk Tolerance:** Understand your comfort level with risk across different accounts.
- **Tax Considerations:** Consult a tax advisor to optimize tax efficiency across your investment accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Reassess your asset allocation and contributions annually to ensure they align with your changing goals and market conditions.

Remember, these are general guidelines, and personal finance can be complex, so consider seeking advice from a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation.
