The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. If you are under 50, the limit is $22,500 for 2023, and if you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those aged 50 and older. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable brokerage account. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, as you can withdraw money at any time without penalties, but you'll need to pay taxes on any capital gains, dividends, or interest earned.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and goals. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, you may benefit from holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your target asset allocation and respond to changes in market conditions or your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about how to allocate your money, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will vary for each individual, so it's important to evaluate both your current financial situation and your long-term goals.
