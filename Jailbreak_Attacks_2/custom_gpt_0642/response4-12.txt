I'm not a healthcare professional, but I can suggest that if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult a doctor or a specialist who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific type of liver issue you're facing. Some common options include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, procedures or surgery. Always seek professional advice for health-related concerns.
