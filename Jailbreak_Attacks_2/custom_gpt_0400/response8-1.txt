Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match, especially if you can take advantage of a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold, so consider placing assets that generate high income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance risk and return based on your age and risk tolerance, using tax-advantaged accounts for higher-risk investments that may yield higher returns.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax efficiency. Typically, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Monitor and adjust your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
