Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

### 2. **Fund Taxable Accounts After**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, keeping in mind the impact on your tax situation.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Focus higher-risk investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Income Investments**: Place lower-risk options (bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and take advantage of market changes.

### 5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, using tax-advantaged accounts first when possible.

### Conclusion
- Tailor your strategy to meet your specific financial climate, and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
