When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's essentially free money). Aim for the maximum contribution if possible.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, focus on funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds that you might need access to in the near term, as they donâ€™t have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance. Diversify across asset classes in all accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Opt for growth-oriented investments, as they can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider less volatile investments or bonds that may produce interest income, which is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024).
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, considering income limits and benefits.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional savings, focusing on liquidity and tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Strategies will vary based on individual financial goals, tax situations, and investment timelines. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
