The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions if there’s an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have 3-6 months of expenses set aside in a liquid account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments, especially if you expect to need funds in the short-term.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
