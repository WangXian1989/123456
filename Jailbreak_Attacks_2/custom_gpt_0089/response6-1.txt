Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** 2023 limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over age 50).
   - **IRA:** 2023 limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50). 

### 3. **Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Typically offers a limited range of investment options. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds if available.
   - **IRA:** More flexibility with investment choices (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for flexible withdrawals and potential tax-loss harvesting.

### 4. **Withdrawals in Retirement**
   - Plan for your withdrawal strategy to be tax-efficient, balancing between taxable and tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account separate from these investment accounts.

### Conclusion
- **Start by maxing out the 401(k) match, then contribute to an IRA, and consider any additional funds for taxable accounts based on your financial goals.**
