Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially “free money.”
   - Max out contributions if you can, as these grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect your tax rate to rise.
   - A Traditional IRA can be beneficial if you want to reduce taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility; you can withdraw anytime without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio (across all accounts) is diversified to protect against risks.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing heavily, maintain an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15-20%
- **IRA**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Account**: 10-20%

**Consider consulting a financial advisor** for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.
