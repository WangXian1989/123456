Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here's a strategic approach:

### Steps to Distribute Your Money:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest surplus funds here for flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - **Tax Implications:** Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to keep your tax bracket lower, then tap into tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Monitor your investments regularly and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Key Considerations:
- **Goal Alignment:** Match account types to your financial goals (e.g., retirement, short-term needs).
- **Age and Timeline:** Younger investors may favor growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might prioritize safety and income.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth and minimize tax burdens over time.
