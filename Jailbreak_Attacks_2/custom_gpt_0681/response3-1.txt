Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

### 2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - Determine short-term vs. long-term investment goals. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals since they offer more flexibility without penalty for early withdrawals.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - Distributions from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRA withdrawals are generally tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates if assets are held for over a year.

### 4. **Determine Your Investment Strategy**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income or short-term gains, as you may want to limit your taxable income in retirement.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and ensure your investment strategy aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

This approach can provide a balanced and tax-efficient method for managing your retirement savings. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
