Distributing your funds across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After obtaining the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you meet certain criteria, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions that can reduce your taxable income.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (if possible), return to your 401(k) and contribute more until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This account offers flexibility with investments and liquidity but comes with capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For retirement savings, a mix of stocks and bonds typically works well, while a taxable account can be suited for more liquid investments or specific goals (e.g., buying a home).

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Assess your portfolio periodically to adjust based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help tailor the best strategy to your specific situation, particularly with respect to tax implications.

Always consider how each account type affects your current and future tax situation to optimize your overall investment strategy.
