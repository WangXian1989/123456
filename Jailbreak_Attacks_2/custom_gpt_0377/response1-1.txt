Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, timeline, risk tolerance, and current tax considerations. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to at least get the full match. It's essentially "free money".

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debts**: Before funneling money into your retirement accounts, it's advisable to pay down any high-interest debt, as those rates might overshadow investment returns.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Generally, if you canâ€™t max out both, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) or IRA because they provide potential tax benefits (e.g., tax-deferred growth).

4. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide if you want to go with a Roth account or a traditional one. A Roth IRA allows you to withdraw funds tax-free in retirement, while a traditional IRA gives you tax deductions on contributions now.

5. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Brackets**: Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding how much to put into traditional vs. Roth accounts.

6. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access in the short term, as they provide more flexibility without penalties for withdrawal.

7. **Diversify Within Accounts**: Ensure that within each account type, you're diversifying your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

8. **Review Regularly**: Your needs may change, so regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy based on your life circumstances and market conditions is vital.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be worth getting personalized advice from a financial advisor. 

Everyone's situation is unique, so tailor your approach to fit your needs.
