To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a good mix of asset types across all accounts to maximize growth while managing risk. Consider stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds for stability.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-deferred accounts grow longer.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of investments in taxable accounts. Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains.

6. **Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider putting more money into a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) to benefit from tax-free withdrawals.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
