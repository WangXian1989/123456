To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then focus on your IRA (Roth or traditional) to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for overflow investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align investments with your time horizon and goals. For short-term goals, prefer safer investments in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, take more risks in your retirement accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, ensuring you're not overly exposed in any single account.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as this can affect your tax bracket and retirement income strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific situation for more personalized strategies.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that reflects your financial goals and risk tolerance.
