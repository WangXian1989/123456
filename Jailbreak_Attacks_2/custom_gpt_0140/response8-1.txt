The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions.

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions, especially if you're nearing retirement age.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are flexible for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary; consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

Always consider the fees, investment options, and your overall financial plan when deciding on your contributions.
