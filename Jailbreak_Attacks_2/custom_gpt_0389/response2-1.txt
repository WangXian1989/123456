To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Maximize contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), hold assets that generate less income (like stocks) to maximize tax deferral.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for which accounts to withdraw from first in retirement to minimize taxes over time (e.g., drawing from taxable accounts first might help you delay 401(k) or IRA withdrawals).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and tax law.
