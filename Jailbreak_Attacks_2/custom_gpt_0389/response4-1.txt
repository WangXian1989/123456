To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have high earning potential, contribute to the maximum allowed ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 if youâ€™re over 50) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The 2024 contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you exceed contribution limits for retirement accounts. Opt for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Assess Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. It may be beneficial to focus on tax-deferred accounts if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reevaluate your allocations to adjust for market changes, performance, and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
