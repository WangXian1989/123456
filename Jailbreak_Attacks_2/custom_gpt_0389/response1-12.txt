I'm not a doctor, but I can share some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition:
   - **Antiviral drugs** for hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids** for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Supplements**: Some may suggest milk thistle or vitamin E, but check with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always discuss treatment options with your doctor to determine what's best for your specific situation.
