To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Fund these last, as they are less tax-advantaged.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds) since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding more conservative investments (bonds, cash) to minimize tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Roth IRA:** Use for assets expected to grow significantly, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Better for lower-growth assets to defer taxes until retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to optimize tax implications (e.g., draw from taxable accounts first).

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** 40%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30%

Adjust percentages based on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice and to ensure that your strategy aligns with your long-term goals.
