I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, losing weight, and quitting alcohol can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Specific medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Supportive Care**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests are crucial.

4. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
