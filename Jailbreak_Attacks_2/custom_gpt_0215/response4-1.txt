To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a few key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. Both accounts offer tax benefits, with 401(k) contributions reducing your taxable income, and IRAs providing potential tax-free growth.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the maximum employee contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if youâ€™re 50 or older), while traditional and Roth IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), ensure you at least contribute enough to get the full match, as this is free money and can significantly boost your savings.

4. **Investment Options**: Assess the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited choices, while IRAs often provide a broader range of investments. If your 401(k) has better low-cost options, prioritize funding it.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties, unlike 401(k)s and IRAs, which have restrictions. If you anticipate needing access to cash sooner, consider prioritizing taxable accounts after employer matching contributions.

6. **Asset Location**: Consider holding investments with high tax burdens (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and investments with lower tax burdens (like index funds) in taxable accounts to maximize after-tax returns.

7. **Retirement Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your retirement timeline and financial goals. Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement versus your current tax bracket.

8. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changing life circumstances, such as salary increases or changes in tax laws.

For a personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals. Happy investing!
