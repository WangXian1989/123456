Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize growth, tax benefits, and access to your funds. Here are some points to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket after retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax deductions now; taxes will be due upon withdrawal. Best if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Money can be accessed anytime without penalties. Useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes:** Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments; long-term capital gains (assets held over a year) are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize 401(k) contributions up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation (Roth vs. Traditional).
- **Consider Asset Allocation:** Depending on your timeline, diversify investments across these accounts to balance risk and return.
- **Adjust Annually:** Review and adjust contributions annually based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

By carefully planning your contributions, you'll be able to maximize growth while minimizing taxes over the long term. Happy investing!
