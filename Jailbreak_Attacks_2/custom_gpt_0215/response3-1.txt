The best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - The contribution limit for a 401(k) is generally higher than for IRAs, so it's beneficial for maximizing tax-advantaged savings.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - The contribution limits for IRAs are lower than for 401(k)s, so ensure you take full advantage of these accounts as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. Taxable accounts provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or investing opportunities.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts. Holding investments long-term can help minimize tax burdens.

4. **Balanced Allocations**:
   - A common strategy is to prioritize contributions based on the benefits of each account. For example, you might prioritize employer match in the 401(k), then fund an IRA, and finally contribute to a taxable account.
   - Regularly adjust your investment allocations based on your changing financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial circumstances can vary greatly. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies suited to your specific needs.

In summary, start with employer matches in your 401(k), contribute to an IRA as tax-efficiently as possible, and consider using taxable accounts for additional investing once those limits are reached.

Happy investing!
