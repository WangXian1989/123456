To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. This provides more liquidity and investment flexibility.

4. **Consider Asset Location**: 
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your retirement timeline.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity in a savings account for emergencies before making significant investments.
