Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). This can offer tax advantages and flexibility in retirement.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, paying that down should be a priority before heavy investing.

4. **Return to 401(k):**
   - After maximizing your IRA contribution, return to your 401(k) and increase your contributions, especially if you're nearing the annual contribution limit.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Finally, contribute to taxable accounts for additional savings and flexibility. These can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals since you can access them without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and goals across all accounts to optimize growth and minimize risk.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type in retirement.
- **Investment Horizon:** The length of time before you need to access the money can impact your investment choices. Longer time horizons can typically withstand more volatility.
- **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial situations and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
