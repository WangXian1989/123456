To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions here next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Optimize Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Focus on capital gains over dividends to minimize tax liability.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA, where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Keep interest-generating assets (like bonds) in your taxable account, as they can incur ordinary income tax.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting as needed based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

By following these strategies, you can maximize your retirement savings while minimizing your tax burden.
