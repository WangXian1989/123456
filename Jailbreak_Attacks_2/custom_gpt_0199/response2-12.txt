I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications (like a low-fat, low-sugar diet), regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may include antivirals or corticosteroids.

3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular liver function tests can help monitor your condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
