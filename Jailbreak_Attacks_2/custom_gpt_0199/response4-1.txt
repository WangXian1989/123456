Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some best practices:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income in the short term.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing investments that generate high dividends or interest here.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - If your goals are long-term (retirement), prioritize maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since you can access these funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Different accounts can hold different strategies (e.g., higher risk in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and adjust as needed to maintain desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
