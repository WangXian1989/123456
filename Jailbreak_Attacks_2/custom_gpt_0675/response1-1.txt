Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal (typically during retirement), which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future.

3. **Diversification**: Keep a mix of assets across all accounts. Stocks, bonds, and other investments should be allocated according to your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in cash or cash-equivalents outside of retirement accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for more flexible investing without penalties for withdrawal, which can be appropriate for short- to medium-term goals.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
