Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider for optimizing your investment distribution:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts provide tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Objectives**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Allocate a larger portion to your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth while taking advantage of compounding and tax deferrals.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term. This allows for more liquidity without penalties.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance in each account. More aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments might be housed in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternatives) and sectors to mitigate risk.

### Summary
- **Max out contributions** to tax-advantaged accounts if possible.
- Consider the **nature of investments** in each account for tax efficiency.
- Regularly **reassess your strategy** as your financial situation and market conditions change.

### Additional Considerations
- Consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific situation and goals.
- Stay informed on changes in tax laws that may affect your strategy. 

This approach allows you to optimize growth potential while considering tax implications and accessibility of funds.
