To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This employer-sponsored plan often comes with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s), allowing for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax contributions with tax-free growth). The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments. You’ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and realized capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth.
   - **Finish with 401(k)**: If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance across all accounts. You might want more aggressive growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Consider Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Since interest income from bonds is taxable, it may be more tax-efficient to hold bonds in your 401(k) or IRA to defer or eliminate taxes.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Be mindful of holding tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds or high-yield funds) in tax-advantaged accounts. In taxable accounts, consider holding index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, which might include selling high-performing assets and buying underperformers.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and tax bracket, it’s beneficial to consult a financial advisor.

By strategically allocating funds between these accounts, you can optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
