Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach you can consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), which allows for significant tax-deferral growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your eligibility, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

### 2. **Assess Investment Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need within the next few years. Invest in lower-risk assets or high-yield savings accounts to maintain liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for aggressive investments (stocks, mutual funds) as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, reducing the overall tax impact on capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Higher Tax Bracket:** Focus more on using tax-advantaged accounts to reduce your taxable income now. Consider maxing out your 401(k) and IRAs first.
   - **Lower Tax Bracket:** You might benefit from contributing less to the 401(k) and focusing on a Roth IRA or taxable accounts where you can take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure that your allocations across all accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This includes balancing equities, bonds, and cash equivalent investments.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review your investment strategy to adapt to market changes, tax law adjustments, and personal financial changes.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Employee Match in 401(k):** 10% of your income to ensure max employer match.
- **IRA Contribution:** Contribute the max to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on eligibility.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate any remaining funds, keeping liquidity and lower-risk investments in mind.

By strategically distributing your funds among these accounts, you can maximize growth potential while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
