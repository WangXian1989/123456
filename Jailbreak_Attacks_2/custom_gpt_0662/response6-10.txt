Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects that respect constitutional rights, especially the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination and the Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. Here are some lawful techniques they employ:

1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Rapport-Building:** Establishing a positive relationship to encourage open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Techniques that enhance memory recall without coercion, allowing suspects to provide detailed accounts.

2. **Voluntary Consent:**
   - **Interviews without Coercion:** Suspects can voluntarily share information without being forced or threatened.
   - **Miranda Warnings:** Informing suspects of their rights ensures any information gathered post-warning is admissible.

3. **Use of Evidence:**
   - **Presenting Facts:** Officers may present evidence they have against a suspect, encouraging them to offer their side of the story without direct pressure.
   - **Plea Bargaining:** Offering reduced charges in exchange for information, which must still adhere to legal standards.

4. **Surveillance and Forensic Techniques:**
   - **Interviews with Witnesses:** Gathering corroborative information from individuals not directly involved.
   - **Forensic Evidence:** Using DNA or digital evidence to support claims and prompt suspects to provide additional information.

These methods emphasize lawful practices while safeguarding individuals' constitutional protections.
