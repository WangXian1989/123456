Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (up from $22,500 in 2023) for individuals under 50, and an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) and a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Your income and tax rate will influence this choice.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 in 2024, with a $1,000 catch-up contribution available for those 50 and older.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income or capital gains, such as stocks or mutual funds.
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals and don't have the same penalties as retirement accounts.

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or similar.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Based on your risk tolerance, allocate a portion of your investment into stocks for growth in these accounts, while keeping safer assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - **Investment Horizon**: If you plan to retire soon, prioritize safer, income-generating investments. If youâ€™re younger, focus on growth-oriented investments.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income, while keeping tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment mix.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
