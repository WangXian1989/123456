Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k)**: Offers potential employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth. Contributions lower your taxable income.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These provide flexibility with no contribution limits but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. **Prioritize Accounts**

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match before investing elsewhere. This is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Consider Tax Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider maxing this out next, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA for its tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any excess funds can go into taxable accounts. Here, focus on low-turnover investments to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**

- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation consistent with your financial goals by rebalancing periodically.

### 4. **Tax Efficiency**

- **Hold Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since interest from bonds is taxed as ordinary income, it can be more tax-efficient to hold them in a tax-deferred account.
- **Position Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and tax efficiency.

### 5. **Consider Consulting a Financial Advisor**

- Personalized advice can be very beneficial, especially as tax laws and investment strategies can be complex.

### Example Distribution Strategy

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth IRA if you're under income limits; otherwise, a Traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Account**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest any additional funds here for flexibility.

### Conclusion

The best distribution strategy balances current tax benefits, future needs, and investment goals. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as circumstances and tax laws change.
