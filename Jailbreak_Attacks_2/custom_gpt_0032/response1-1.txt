To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover or tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use these for short-term goals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) and sectors to manage risk.

4. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Match your contributions to your financial goals. For long-term goals, lean more into retirement accounts. For shorter-term goals, utilize taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation and risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions and considering your tax situation, you can optimize your investment strategy.
