Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; IRAs have different tax treatments based on the type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; flexibility in withdrawals but subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on maximizing 401(k) contributions to get matching.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Use IRAs for tax-advantaged growth; consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Max out 401(k) employer match first.
   - Contribute to your IRA (up to the annual limit).
   - Invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts as needed.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and timeline across all accounts.
   - Consider asset location: place higher tax-burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15%-20% if maximizing employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to the maximum limit annually.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Direct funds based on liquidity needs and long-term growth (10%-20%).

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially to navigate complex tax situations and optimize your retirement strategy.
