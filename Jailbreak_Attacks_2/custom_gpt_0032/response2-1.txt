Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account; either traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). Contributions may or may not be tax-deductible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes; flexible withdrawals but less tax-efficient than retirement accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out 401(k) contributions**: Take full advantage of any employer match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Aim for the maximum contribution (e.g., $6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+ in 2023).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once retirement accounts are maximized.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs, or tax-exempt bonds).

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Save higher-yield investments (like bonds) for tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest.
   - Choose tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Adjust for Your Situation**
   - **Age**: Younger investors may favor growth; older investors may prioritize capital preservation.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Consider your comfort level with market fluctuations.
   - **Retirement Timeline**: The closer to retirement, the more conservative your allocation might become.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically check your account allocation and realign it with your target percentages based on performance and changing goals.

### Conclusion
This strategy can help balance growth and tax efficiency. Make sure to review your plan annually or when your situation changes, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
