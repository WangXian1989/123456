Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to meet any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Once you max out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and retirement goals.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Useful if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Investment Costs**:
   - Choose low-cost investment options in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize returns over time.

5. **Maintain Liquidity**:
   - Keep a portion of your savings in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs since withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Reassess your portfolio allocation annually or when your financial situation changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.
