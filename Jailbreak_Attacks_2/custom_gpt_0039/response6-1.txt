Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any investments you might need to access before retirement, as they allow for flexibility without penalties.

### 3. **Investing Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while keeping fixed-income investments in taxable accounts for potential tax benefits on interest.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Cash Needs**
   - **Liquidity**: Ensure you have sufficient funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs without penalties.

### 5. **Withdrawals Strategy**
   - **Roth Conversions**: If you're in a lower tax bracket during certain years, consider converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs to minimize future tax liabilities.

### Final Thoughts
- Regularly review and adjust your distribution based on changes in income, expenses, and life events.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. 

Balancing these factors will help ensure a comprehensive and tax-efficient investment strategy.
