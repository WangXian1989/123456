Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (free money up to a certain percentage).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions for tax benefits.

2. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, select funds with lower fees. Look for index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers more investment options. Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Account**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, and consider municipal bonds for tax-free interest.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may lower taxable income; withdrawals are taxed (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Account**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments long-term to minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a cash reserve separate from these investment accounts for immediate needs.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Long-term Goals**: Align your investments with your retirement timeline; the longer until retirement, the more you can invest in higher-risk options.
