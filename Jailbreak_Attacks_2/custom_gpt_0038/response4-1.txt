To effectively distribute your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider a variety of factors such as your investment goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown of how to think through this distribution, along with some pros and cons of each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which is essentially 'free money.'
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
     - Grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment choices compared to IRAs.
     - Penalties for early withdrawal (before age 59½).

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Pros:**
     - More investment flexibility and options than 401(k)s.
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Cons:**
     - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
     - Income limits apply for Roth IRA contributions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits and flexible access to funds.
     - You can invest in a wide variety of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate.
     - Capital gains tax applies only when assets are sold.
   - **Cons:**
     - Gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.
     - Less tax-advantaged growth compared to retirement accounts.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to at least get the full employer match before investing more into IRAs or taxable accounts.
   
2. **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, fund a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation and contribution limits. Consider a Roth IRA if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may require flexibility or for money you plan to access before retirement. This is also a good place to hold investments that generate favorable long-term capital gains, such as stocks held for longer than a year.

4. **Asset Location:** Consider placing higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for the tax benefits, while keeping fixed-income investments (bonds) in taxable accounts for potentially better tax treatment.

5. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your distribution strategy based on changes in your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. 

In summary, a common approach is to prioritize maximizing contributions to a 401(k) (especially to get any employer match), then fund an IRA, and finally utilize taxable accounts for additional investing flexibility. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
