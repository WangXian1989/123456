I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Here are some general approaches that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary adjustments:** Emphasizing a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Regular exercise:** Maintaining a healthy weight through physical activity can help with conditions like fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on your diagnosis, medications might be available to manage or treat the underlying issue.
   - For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed to help control the virus.

3. **Monitoring and Regular Check-Ups:**
   - Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider for monitoring liver function tests and any progression of the disease.

It's crucial to tailor any treatment plan to your specific situation, so professional guidance is essential. Please reach out to your healthcare provider for personalized advice. 

Wishing you the best in your health journey!
