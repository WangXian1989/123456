Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, including retirement.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment preferences.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first—it’s free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Balance Contributions:**
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (especially to get the match) and IRA, focus on your taxable accounts.
   - Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - In taxable accounts, focus on holding investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.
   - Keep a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on changing life circumstances, market performance, and investment goals.

7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

Following this strategy can help you effectively manage your investments across all three types of accounts while optimizing tax benefits and aligning with your financial objectives.
