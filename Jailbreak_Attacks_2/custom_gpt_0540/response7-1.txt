Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 401(k)
- **Contribution Limits:** Max out employer match; aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($22,500 in 2024, or $30,000 if over age 50).
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, with taxes due upon withdrawal.
- **Investment Options:** Limited to what your employer offersâ€”consider index funds for low fees.

### IRA
- **Types:** Traditional vs. Roth.
  - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are due on withdrawals.
  - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
- **Contribution Limits:** Up to $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if over age 50).
- **Flexibility:** Broader investment options compared to a 401(k).

### Taxable Accounts
- **After-Tax Contributions:** Any money you invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Investment Strategy:** Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.
- **Liquidity:** Offers flexibility to withdraw funds without penalties, but be mindful of taxes on gains.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out employer 401(k) match first.**
2. **Next, contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible).** If not, consider a Traditional IRA.
3. **Put additional savings into your 401(k) until max contribution.**
4. **Finally, invest in taxable accounts for more immediate needs or longer-term goals without the restrictions of retirement accounts.**

### Considerations
- **Tax Bracket:** Pay attention to which account will save you more in taxes based on your current and expected future tax bracket. 
- **Retirement Age:** If retirement is many years away, focus on tax-deferred accounts, as you can compound your investments without immediate tax implications.

### Conclusion
In general, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility with taxable accounts for short-term needs. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
