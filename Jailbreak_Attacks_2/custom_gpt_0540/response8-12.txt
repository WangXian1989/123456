I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, common treatments might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function tests and imaging studies to track the condition of the liver.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver tumors or cirrhosis complications, surgical options might be necessary, including liver transplantation.

5. **Supportive Care**: Managing symptoms and complications, which may involve dietary adjustments or medications for related symptoms (like itchiness or fluid retention).

Always consult your doctor for advice tailored to your specific situation.
