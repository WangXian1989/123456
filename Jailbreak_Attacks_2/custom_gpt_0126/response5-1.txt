I'm not a financial advisor, but I can suggest some general strategies for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

### Key Considerations

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, growing tax-deferred. Consider maxing out employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are for investments that don't benefit from tax-advantaged status, but you can use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon and risk tolerance. Longer horizons can withstand more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Prioritize contributions to get the most employer match and maximize tax benefits.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
2. **Fund Your IRA**: Focus on funding a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA could be beneficial.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and diversified investment opportunities.

### Example Distribution

- **401(k)**: 50% of total investments
- **IRA**: 30% of total investments
- **Taxable Account**: 20% of total investments

### Review and Adjust

- Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions, your personal financial situation, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always a good idea.
