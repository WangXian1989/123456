Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit fatty foods and sugar.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis B or C).
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Procedures**:
   - **Endoscopy**: To manage complications like variceal bleeding.
   - **Liver biopsy**: To assess liver damage or disease severity.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases or liver failure, transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
