Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Max out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions can lower your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement may be taxed.
- **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts allow for capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider using these for investments that yield long-term growth.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments that appreciate over time, as you wonâ€™t pay taxes until you withdraw funds.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 4. Diversify
Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and maintain growth potential.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
Review and adjust allocations to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

### Example Strategy
1. Maximize 401(k) contributions to the match limit.
2. Contribute to an IRA each year.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings once the above limits are reached.

### Conclusion
It's wise to consult with a financial planner to tailor these guidelines to your specific situation, ensuring your strategy aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.
