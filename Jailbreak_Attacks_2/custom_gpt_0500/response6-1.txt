Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus**: If saving for retirement is your priority, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you have adequate funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: 
     - Contribute enough to get any available employer match—this is essentially free money.
     - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as it lowers your taxable income.

   - **IRA**: 
     - Choose a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
     - A Traditional IRA may be better if you want to deduct contributions now and pay taxes upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Strategize Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest Wisely**: Place investments that generate a lot of taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Long-Term Focus**: Utilize taxable accounts for long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Maintain a Balanced Allocation**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure no single asset class is overrepresented across accounts to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket Awareness**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding how much to place in each account type.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals from each account strategically during retirement to minimize tax liabilities.

By following this structured approach, you can optimize your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for long-term growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity.
