To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and IRA contributions are tax-deferred, which means you wonâ€™t pay taxes on that income until withdrawal. Prioritize these accounts for your tax-advantaged funds.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Generally, aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Distribute assets based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments like stocks belong in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could be suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify within your 401(k) and IRA across various asset classes to manage risk. This could include a mix of domestic and international stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

6. **Consider Contributions**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the IRS limit. Then, if additional funds are available, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, subject to income limits.
   - Once those limits are reached, invest any surplus in a taxable account.

7. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, employ strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains. This involves selling investments at a loss to reduce tax liability.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on market performance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

9. **Think Long-Term**:
   - Since retirement accounts typically come with penalties for early withdrawals, maintain a long-term investment strategy focusing on growth and compounding.

This approach will maximize your tax-advantaged savings while allowing flexibility with liquid assets. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
