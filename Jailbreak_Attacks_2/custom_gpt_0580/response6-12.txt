I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. It's crucial to get a proper diagnosis and treatment plan based on your specific condition. Common treatments might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, or even surgery in certain cases. Please seek medical attention for accurate guidance.
