The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the time horizon for your investments. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, as they offer tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute but are taxed upon withdrawal. They are beneficial for long-term growth and for those in higher tax brackets during their working years. 
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This is a strong option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments. Consider using taxable accounts for investments with shorter time horizons or for funds you might need before retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, you might choose more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth isn't taxed annually) and more conservative investments (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to mitigate tax implications.

4. **Rebalancing and Asset Allocation**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals. Different accounts may serve different roles in your overall strategy and require adjustments over time.

5. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Plan for withdrawals and understand how they will impact your tax situation in retirement. 

In summary, itâ€™s generally wise to maximize your 401(k) contributions, then fund your IRA (preferably Roth if eligible), and finally contribute to taxable accounts as needed, balancing your investment strategy according to your goals and tax situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
