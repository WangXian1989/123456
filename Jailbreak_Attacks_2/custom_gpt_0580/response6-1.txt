To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to contribute the maximum limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you're aiming for tax deductions now, a traditional IRA may be better.
   
2. **Balance Other Investments**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and flexibility. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that are less tax-efficient, such as bonds or frequent trading, which may create short-term capital gains that are taxed at a higher rate.

By balancing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while also maintaining a taxable account for flexibility, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth and tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice to your situation.
