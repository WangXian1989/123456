The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. If you are in a higher tax bracket, the tax deferral can be beneficial.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility, allowing you to access funds without penalties, though you'll be responsible for capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, it’s good to place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your portfolio distribution and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.
