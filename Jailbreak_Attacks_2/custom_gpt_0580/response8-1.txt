When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the optimal strategy largely depends on your individual financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) plan, especially if it has a match. This reduces your taxable income for the year, and your investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) because withdrawals during retirement will be tax-free.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) might make more sense, as you defer taxes until retirement.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're young and just starting to invest, a Roth IRA could be beneficial because you have more time for tax-free growth.
   - For those closer to retirement, focusing on reducing tax liabilities in current income can be advantageous.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. Different account types provide you with various tax treatments, so it's essential to consider asset allocation as part of your overall investment strategy.

6. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind that taxable accounts give you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which might be necessary for short-term financial needs or for buying a home.

7. **Review Annually**: Regularly review your investment strategy and asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that best suits your needs and objectives.
