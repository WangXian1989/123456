I'm glad you're thinking about your investment strategy! To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you might consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)** 🏦
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially “free money” for your retirement!

2. **Consider Tax Implications** 🧾
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: With a traditional IRA, like the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed. In a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free until you sell. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when you do sell.

3. **Estimate Your Expected Tax Rate in Retirement** 📊
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA). If you think you’ll be in the same or a higher bracket, the Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

4. **Diversify Your Investments** 🌍
   - Utilize different investment vehicles based on their tax implications. For example, you might want to hold more tax-inefficient investments like bonds in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient investments like stocks in taxable accounts.

5. **Contribute Regularly and Rebalance** 🔄
   - Make regular contributions to all accounts and periodically rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice** 🤝
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation.

This is a general guideline, and the best distribution can vary based on your individual financial goals, income, and retirement plans. Make sure to keep your long-term objectives in mind while making these decisions.
