Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **High Contributions:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if youâ€™re in a low tax bracket now, as this can lower your taxable income. 

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Assess Roth vs. Traditional:** Determine whether a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) aligns better with your future tax strategy.
   - **Contribute to the Limit:** Try to max out your contributions if financially feasible, as this can provide significant tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Use for Flexibility:** Allocate funds to a taxable account for expenses or investment opportunities that may arise before retirement, as these accounts allow for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Consider Asset Location:** Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) within taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Start by fully utilizing the 401(k) match.
- Add contributions to the IRA, emphasizing tax considerations.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially for short to medium-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a personalized strategy that accounts for your specific financial situation and goals.
