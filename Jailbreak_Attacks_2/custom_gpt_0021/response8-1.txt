To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA next, as they provide tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond tax-advantaged accounts, especially for short-term goals or if you want access without penalties.

5. **Investment Choices**: Choose more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of withdrawal strategies and the tax consequences associated with each account type.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your personal financial situation.
