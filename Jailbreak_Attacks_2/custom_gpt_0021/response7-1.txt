Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out your 401(k)** contributions (especially if your employer offers matching).
   - **Contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth) based on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes whenever you sell, so it's generally better to hold investments long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Aggressive Growth**: You might allocate more to stocks in the 401(k) or IRA, as these accounts are long-term and often benefit from compounding growth.
   - **Bonds or Stable Investments**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable tax treatments on interest income.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure that you have enough liquidity in your taxable accounts for emergencies before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal circumstances.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable**: 30%
