Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several key considerations:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contribution limit ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if over age 50).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA ($6,500 limit for 2024, or $7,500 if over age 50).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes on profits. Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks offer higher growth potential but come with higher volatility.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and place more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

5. **Annual Review**: 
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio. Adjust contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If needed, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
