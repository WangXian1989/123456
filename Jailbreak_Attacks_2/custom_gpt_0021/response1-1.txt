The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now; you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments with favorable capital gains treatment, especially for funds you may need before retirement age.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. It can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personalized strategy can be very beneficial, especially for complex situations.

Tailoring these principles to your specific situation will help maximize your investment potential.
