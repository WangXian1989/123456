Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable limit, especially if you can get an employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Choose a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional money into a taxable investment account. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals and use of specific investment strategies (like tax-loss harvesting).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your income and tax situation, certain accounts may be more advantageous. Higher earners might benefit from pre-tax contributions to lower taxable income.

7. **Investment Horizon**: Align your investments with your time horizon. Longer-term investments can generally tolerate more risk.

8. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
