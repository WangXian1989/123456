To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, which is free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions for potential tax benefits.
   - Consider Roth vs. Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold high-growth, tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA).
   - Keep bonds, which generate interest income, in taxable accounts where capital gains tax can be more favorable.

4. **Rebalancing**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level across all accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: 
   - When it's time to withdraw, consider tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
