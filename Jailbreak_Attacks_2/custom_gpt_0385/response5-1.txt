(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to prioritize contributions to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k), especially if thereâ€™s a match, as this is free money. After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Finally, any extra savings can be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes. Itâ€™s also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific needs.

Pour cash into your 401(k) first if your employer dishes out a match â€“ thatâ€™s basically a raise without doing extra work. Once thatâ€™s sweet, shift gears and open an IRA â€“ go with a Roth if you think your future self will be in a higher tax bracket. Taxable accounts are great for flexibility, but just remember, Uncle Sam is gonna want his cut if you play there. Blitz through your financial goals, keep an eye on taxes, and donâ€™t hesitate to hit up a pro if you feel lost!
