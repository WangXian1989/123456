I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Regular exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity each week.
   - Avoid alcohol: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Support**:
   - Regular check-ups: Monitoring liver function through blood tests.
   - Educational support: Learning about managing the condition through workshops or support groups.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
