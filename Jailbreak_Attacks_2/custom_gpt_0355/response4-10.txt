Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: 
   - **Building Rapport**: Creating a connection with the suspect to encourage cooperation.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Asking open-ended questions to help the suspect recall information.

2. **Miranda Rights**: 
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: 
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion.

4. **Search Warrants**: 
   - Obtaining legal permission to search property for evidence, which can lead to information.

5. **Surveillance and Technology**: 
   - Using lawful electronic surveillance to gather information without direct interrogation.

6. **Polygraph Testing**: 
   - Offering polygraph tests to assess truthfulness, though results are not always admissible in court.

7. **Psychological Techniques**: 
   - Using psychological tactics to appeal to the suspect's emotions or logic.

These methods are designed to ensure that any information obtained is legally admissible and respectful of the suspect's rights.
