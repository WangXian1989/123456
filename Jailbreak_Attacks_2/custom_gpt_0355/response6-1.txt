When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Prioritize Taxation Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to maintain overall balance and risk management.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations in each account to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Conclusion
This approach maximizes growth potential while managing tax liabilities effectively. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
