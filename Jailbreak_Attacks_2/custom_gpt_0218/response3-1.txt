Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Next, consider funding a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower tax implications (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds).
   - Hold higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)s and IRAs) to defer taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, considering tax brackets and required minimum distributions (RMDs).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your life situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
