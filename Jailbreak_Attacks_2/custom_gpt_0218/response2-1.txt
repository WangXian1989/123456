Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least up to that limit. Consider pretax contributions to lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are limited based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This allows more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Investment**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs).
   - **Income Funds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains and the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.
