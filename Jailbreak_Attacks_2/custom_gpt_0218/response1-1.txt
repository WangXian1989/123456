Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s free money!

2. **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your match, continue contributing to your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and to invest beyond retirement accounts. Consider low-turnover investments like index funds to minimize taxes.

5. **Debt Consideration**: Pay down high-interest debt before making significant investments.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of expenses saved before heavily investing.

**Final Tips**:
- Review your asset allocation regularly.
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
