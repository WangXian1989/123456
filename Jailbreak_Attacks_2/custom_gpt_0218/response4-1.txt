Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing the maximum allowed, especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily in these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon when determining how to allocate investments within these accounts.
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Itâ€™s also beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
