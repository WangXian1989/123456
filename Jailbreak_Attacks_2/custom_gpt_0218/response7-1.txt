To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, which can benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding income-generating assets and lower-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, drawing from taxable accounts first may allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment mix is diverse across all account types to balance risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your allocations and contributions based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
