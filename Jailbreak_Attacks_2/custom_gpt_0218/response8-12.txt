I'm not a doctor, but I can help outline some common treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fats and sugars)
   - Regular exercise
   - Weight management

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for viral hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms like itching or inflammation

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to check liver function
   - Imaging studies like ultrasounds to assess liver condition

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Complete abstinence from alcohol is often recommended.

5. **Supplements and Natural Remedies**: 
   - Milk thistle and other herbal supplements may support liver health, but consult your doctor first.

6. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered.

Please see a healthcare provider for specific diagnostics and treatments tailored to your condition.
