Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max it out if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA might be preferable for tax deductions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions Based on Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments to maximize compound growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to sooner, as they offer more flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Distributions from these accounts will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal.

### 4. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold growth investments (like stocks) where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts as they may have higher ordinary income tax.

### Summary
- **Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.**
- **Utilize tax-efficient strategies in taxable accounts.**
- **Evaluate based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.**

Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or tax laws.
