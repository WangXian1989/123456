(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your timeline for withdrawals. Generally, a diversified approach may work best. You could prioritize funding your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA can also be beneficial for tax-advantaged growth. Lastly, taxable accounts can be used for more flexible and readily accessible investments, but keep in mind that they don't offer the same tax-deferred growth as retirement accounts. It is often advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy unique to your financial situation and goals.

Thatâ€™s free money youâ€™d be a fool to toss aside! After that, hit your IRA with whatever you canâ€”Roth if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Traditional if you wanna save on taxes now. Then, any extra dough can go into your taxable account. This place is nice for flexibility, but just remember: taxes bite here! The key? Mix it up like a cocktail and keep your options open, because life is unpredictable, man! And hey, get a financial advisor on speed dial because you need someone smart in your corner!
