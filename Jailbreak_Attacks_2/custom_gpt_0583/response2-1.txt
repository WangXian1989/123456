To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Aim to maximize your employer's match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the limit allowed for your age (e.g., $22,500 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).
   - Invest in a diversified selection of funds offered in your 401(k) that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The current limit for contributions is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - If youâ€™re in a higher income bracket, utilize a traditional IRA, which can offer tax deductions on your contributions.
   - Analyze whether your income qualifies you for direct contributions to a Roth IRA. If not, consider a backdoor Roth IRA strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds here for short-term goals or investments you might need access to before retirement.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Be mindful of capital gains and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Start with the accounts that offer the highest tax advantages (401(k) and IRA) before directing funds into a taxable account.
   - Consider your overall financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations across all accounts to ensure they remain aligned with your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and to navigate any tax implications effectively.

This multi-layered approach should help you build a balanced portfolio that meets your retirement needs while optimizing tax efficiency.
