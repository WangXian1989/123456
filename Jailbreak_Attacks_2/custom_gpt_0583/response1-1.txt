Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions for tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA after taking full advantage of your 401(k) match.
   - If you qualify, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
   - You can choose a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - Use taxable accounts primarily for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets within tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax burdens on interest income.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- Prioritize contributions based on employer match, then max out IRAs (especially Roth if eligible), and finally allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changing goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Example:
- 401(k): Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- IRA: Consider maxing out contributions (both Traditional and Roth based on eligibility).
- Taxable: After maximizing the above, allocate any remaining investment funds here, focusing on low-turnover investments.

### Important Considerations:
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that matches your personal situation and to ensure you are optimizing for your long-term financial goals.
