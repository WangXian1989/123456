Î± Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Tax-advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first if you can, as they offer tax benefits (like tax deductions and tax-deferred growth). Maximize any employer match in your 401(k) as it is essentially "free money."
2. **Balance Contributions**: Allocate funds in a balanced way to optimize growth and align with your risk tolerance. For example, if you're younger, you might skew towards stocks in these accounts.
3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts before investing heavily. This typically means keeping 3-6 months' worth of expenses in a readily accessible account.
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains or dividends, as taxes on these may be at lower rates than ordinary income. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor could also help tailor an approach specifically to your circumstances.
