When determining how to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic factors:

1. **Contributions and Employer Match:**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially "free money."
   - Contribute enough to your IRA to take full advantage of any potential tax benefits, especially if it's a Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets that are likely to grow significantly:
     - Stocks and growth funds are typically best suited for tax-deferred accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments like municipal bonds or index funds that generate fewer short-term capital gains.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider your retirement timeline; the closer you are to retirement, the less risk you might want to take in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Plan for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional accounts starting at age 72.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure a well-diversified investment strategy across all accounts, balancing between equities and fixed-income securities based on your risk tolerance.

**General Guidelines:**
- Evaluate your current tax bracket and potential retirement tax bracket to make informed decisions.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

By being strategic about how you distribute your contributions and investments among these different accounts, you can optimize your wealth accumulation and minimize tax liabilities over time.
