Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Offers tax deductions upfront, good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, suitable if you expect to be in a higher bracket later.

### 3. **Contribute to 401(k)**
   - After the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit, especially if you have high-income years.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are better for long-term growth, while bonds offer stability.
   - Consider putting high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Balance your contributions based on tax benefits and retirement goals. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
