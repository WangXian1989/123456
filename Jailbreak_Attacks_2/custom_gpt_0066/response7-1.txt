Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. Fill Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **401(k):** If you can't contribute to an IRA or need to save for retirement aggressively, maximize your contributions to your 401(k) after the employer match.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate little taxable income (e.g., index funds) or for assets you may need to access before retirement without penalties.

### 4. Diversification and Asset Allocation
- Ensure you're diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 5. Revisit Regularly
- Reassess your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income
- **IRA:** Max out up to the contribution limit if possible
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after tax-advantaged accounts are funded

### Final Thoughts
Consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on personal goals and tax situations.
