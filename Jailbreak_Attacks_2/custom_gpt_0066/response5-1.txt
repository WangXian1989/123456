Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full match, if available. It’s essentially “free money.”
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Utilize for higher growth potential since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributes pre-tax, reducing taxable income now, but taxed upon withdrawal. Good if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals (and growth) are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect a higher tax rate in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Useful for short- to mid-term objectives or emergencies. 
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Suggested Allocation:**
1. **Prioritize contributions to the 401(k) up to the match.**
2. **Consider maxing out an IRA (Roth or Traditional) next.**
3. **Invest in taxable accounts last, focusing on investment growth and tax efficiency.**

### **Monitoring and Adjusting:**
- Regularly review and adjust allocations based on performance, changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- Individual circumstances vary; consider seeking personalized advice to optimize your strategy.

This balanced approach can help ensure your investments grow effectively while managing tax implications throughout your life.
