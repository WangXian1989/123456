Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Generally, prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA before taxable accounts due to tax benefits.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15-20% of salary (up to the match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any remaining funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Summary
Evaluate your situation and adjust based on your goals, income level, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
