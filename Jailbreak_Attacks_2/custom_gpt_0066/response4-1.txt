Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions:** 
   - Maximize employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if you're in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement (e.g., buying a home).
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Order of Investment:
1. **401(k) up to employer match**
2. **IRA contributions (preferably Roth)**
3. **401(k) contributions (maxing if possible)**
4. **Taxable accounts (for additional savings or short-term needs)**

### Additional Considerations:
- **Diversification:** Ensure you’re not too heavily weighted in any asset class across accounts.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review your asset allocation to maintain your target risk profile.
- **Tax Implications:** Be strategic about tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific situation.
