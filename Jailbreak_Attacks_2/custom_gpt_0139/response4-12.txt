I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, common treatment options include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or infection.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests with your healthcare provider is crucial.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative therapies**: Some explore herbal supplementsâ€”always consult a doctor first.

It's best to discuss treatment options with a healthcare professional tailored to your specific condition.
