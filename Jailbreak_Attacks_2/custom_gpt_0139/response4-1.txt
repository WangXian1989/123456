To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maxing this out if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. Otherwise, a traditional IRA also offers tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you may need access to sooner, keeping in mind that capital gains taxes apply.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified, balancing risk and potential returns.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies before maximizing retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level and adjust for changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Overall, balance immediate access needs with long-term growth strategies while considering tax implications.
