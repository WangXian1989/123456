I'm not a financial advisor, but here are some general strategies for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contribution**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA next (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Use these for investments that may generate lower taxes, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-inefficient ones in your retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
