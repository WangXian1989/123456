When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several key considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional plans), reducing your taxable income now, but taxes are due on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for traditional IRAs, or tax-free withdrawals for Roth IRAs (contributions are made after-tax).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and taxes are paid on any dividends, interest, or capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For example, as of 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available for those over certain ages).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider your financial goals and when you'll need access to the funds. Long-term goals may be better suited to tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term needs might be appropriate for taxable accounts.

4. **Risk Tolerance**: 
   - Your risk tolerance should influence the investment choices within each account. Typically, you might want a more aggressive approach in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts during retirement. This affects tax implications and how you should structure your contributions now.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first.
- **Fully Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider fully funding your IRA.
- **Return to 401(k)**: Once you've maximized your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investing after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, especially for short-term goals or for investment flexibility.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize a strategy based on your unique situation. Would you like to dive deeper into any specific aspect of this distribution strategy?
