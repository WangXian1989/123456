Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected future tax rate.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After contributing to your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These are flexible for withdrawals and can be invested in ways that minimize tax consequences, such as focusing on tax-efficient funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance, including a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and more tax-efficient options (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Key Considerations:
- **Current and Expected Tax Brackets**: Your tax situation now and in retirement will affect the order of contributions.
- **Investment Goals**: Consider your time horizon for needing the money.
- **Withdrawal Rules**: Understand the implications of withdrawing from each account type.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
