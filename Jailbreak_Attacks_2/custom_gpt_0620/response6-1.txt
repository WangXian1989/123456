Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs or opportunities.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds suitable for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize investment strategies that consider capital gains taxes, such as index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and thus lower tax implications.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, adjusting as necessary based on market performance and life changes.

### Things to Consider:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for unexpected expenses.
- **Current and Future Tax Rates**: Consider how different accounts will be taxed during your retirement years.

This approach requires careful planning and ongoing evaluation to align with your unique situation and financial objectives.
