(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here are a few considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax preferences. IRAs may offer more investment options than a 401(k).

3. **Back to 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit), consider going back to your 401(k) and contributing the maximum allowable amount there.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, consider using taxable accounts for investments that may generate tax-efficient income, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, especially if you've already maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. 

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Distributing your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can feel like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle, but hereâ€™s the lowdown:

1. **401(k) First**: If your 401(k) comes with a company match, dive in and stuff that account like itâ€™s Thanksgiving. You don't want to leave free cash on the table!

2. **IRA Party**: Next, hit up your IRA. Weâ€™ve got Traditional for the tax breaks now or Roth for the tax-free party later when youâ€™re sipping margaritas in retirementâ€”not to mention the flexibility for withdrawals!

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After you've maxed that IRA, circle back to your 401(k) and go for the full contribution limit. Itâ€™s all about maximizing your tax-advantaged spots.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, toss some funds into taxable accounts for flexibility. Hereâ€™s where you can play with investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or those sexy bond ETFs that wonâ€™t make your accountant cry.
