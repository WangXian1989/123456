Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general overview:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Advantages**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer matching contributions.
   - **Distribution Strategy**: Maximize employer matches first, then consider your tax bracket to decide how much to allocate here.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Distribution Strategy**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth IRA. Otherwise, balance between traditional and Roth depending on your current vs. expected future income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility, no contribution limits, and easier access to funds.
   - **Distribution Strategy**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or stocks that may generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### **General Recommendations**
- **Prioritize contributions**: Start with the account that offers the best immediate tax benefits or employer match.
- **Balance with liquidity needs**: Keep enough in taxable accounts for short-term needs but build tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
- **Consider diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across all accounts.

### **Professional Advice**
It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and retirement goals.
