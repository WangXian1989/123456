Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Choose Appropriate Investments**: Select a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**
   - **Evaluate Tax Implications**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. A Traditional IRA might be better if you need current tax deductions.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If you're eligible, aim to fully fund your IRA before it's tax time.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Long-Term Growth**: Focus on investments that benefit from long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Funds**: Look for index funds or ETFs that minimize turnover to reduce taxable events.

### Overall Strategy
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
- **Balance Risk**: Diversify your investments across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on market conditions and personal financial goals.
