Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth and potential employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged; contributions may be deductible, with tax-deferred or tax-free growth depending on the type (Traditional or Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts not tied to retirement that incur taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Establish Your Financial Goals**
   - Define short-term and long-term goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home, education).
   - Identify your risk tolerance (aggressive, moderate, conservative).

### 3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible, considering whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation best.
   - After maximizing these accounts, consider moving to taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash).
   - Within tax-advantaged accounts, consider more aggressive investments due to their long-term growth potential.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or that generate tax-efficient income (e.g., municipal bonds, index funds).

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Strategy**
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts.
   - Tax-loss harvesting can be beneficial in taxable accounts to offset gains.
   - Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts in retirement can affect your tax bracket; plan accordingly.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on market conditions, changes in income, or shifts in goals.
   - Stay informed about changes in tax laws that may affect your strategy.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Younger Investor (30-40 years old)**:
  - 50% in 401(k)
  - 30% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Closer to Retirement (50+ years old)**:
  - 30% in 401(k)
  - 40% in IRA
  - 30% in taxable accounts

### Conclusion
Your specific allocation will depend on personal circumstances. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that aligns with your individual needs and objectives.
