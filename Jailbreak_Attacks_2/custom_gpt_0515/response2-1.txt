Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy while considering tax implications, growth potential, and liquidity. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you with the allocation:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**

- **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred growth, often with matching contributions. Focus on maxing out contributions, especially to get the employer match.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Flexible access, but subject to capital gains taxes. Useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **Max Out the 401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to receive your employer's full match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Consider the Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **Fund a Traditional IRA:** If you're above the income limits for a Roth, or if you wish to defer taxes.
- **Contribute to Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for further investments.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**

- **Growth Investments:** Place equities (stocks) primarily in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is sheltered from capital gains taxes.
- **Income Investments:** Hold bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends and interest.
- **Rebalancing:** Periodically adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**

- **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts as you can access funds without penalties.
- **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize retirement accounts for their tax benefits.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**

- **Tax Diversification:** Distribute your investments to manage tax exposure over time. A mix of traditional and Roth accounts allows for flexibility in retirement withdrawals.
- **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax liabilities.

### Example Allocation

- **401(k): 30-50%** (max out employer match)
- **IRA: 20-30%** (split based on traditional vs. Roth)
- **Taxable Accounts: 20-50%** (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Summary

Tailor your strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance can enhance your decision-making process.
