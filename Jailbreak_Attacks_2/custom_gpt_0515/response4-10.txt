Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interviews and Interrogations**: Conducting legally compliant questioning techniques, ensuring the suspect is informed of their rights (Miranda rights) to remain silent and have an attorney present.

2. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage openness. This tactic focuses on creating a non-threatening environment.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing methods that help witnesses and suspects recall information by encouraging them to reconstruct the context of an event.

4. **Polygraph Tests**: Optional, non-invasive lie detector tests can be used as a tool to gauge truthfulness, although results are not always admissible in court.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or reduced sentences can encourage suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring any agreement is clearly understood and lawful.

6. **Surveillance and Undercover Operations**: Gathering information through observation or undercover work, as long as such activities comply with legal standards.

Each method must be used cautiously to ensure compliance with the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
