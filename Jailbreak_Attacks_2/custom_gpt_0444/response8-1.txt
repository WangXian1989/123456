The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high tax rate and your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. It provides immediate tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation. 
      - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
      - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. This is particularly useful for short-to-medium-term goals since funds can be accessed without penalty.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk and align with your investment goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on market conditions, life changes, and retirement goals.

Before making changes to your investment strategy, itâ€™s wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your personal circumstances.
