I'm unable to provide financial advice, but I can suggest a general approach for diversifying your investments across different accounts:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of employer matching. Focus on equities or balanced funds if youâ€™re younger, transitioning to more bonds as you approach retirement.

2. **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for current tax deduction. Balance between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments. Consider tax-efficient funds like index funds and avoid frequent trading to limit tax liabilities.

A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation and goals.
