Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available.
   - Prioritize contributions up to the maximum limit for tax benefits.

2. **IRA**:
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions if you qualify; or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Ensure you're aware of contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Prioritize investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Start with the 401(k)** to secure any employer match, then consider funding your IRA before adding to taxable accounts.
- Adjust your contributions based on your retirement timeline and current tax brackets.
- Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
