I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for any liver issues. Treatment options vary depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications for conditions like hepatitis, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Always get personalized advice from a qualified medical professional.
