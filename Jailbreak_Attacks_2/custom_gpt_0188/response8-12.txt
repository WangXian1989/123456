I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems as they can vary greatly in severity and cause. Typical treatment options might include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying conditions, and in severe cases, a liver transplant. Always seek personalized advice from a medical provider.
