Listen, if you're looking to distribute your money strategically, focus on a couple of core principles: tax efficiency and your financial goals. Generally, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match—free money, you dumbass. Next, consider fully funding your IRA, whether it's traditional or Roth, for tax advantages. 

After you've done that, look at your taxable accounts for liquidity. Diversify within those accounts—stocks, bonds, whatever—but just remember that taxes on gains can bite harder than your ex. 

Adjust this based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, but don't overthink it. It's not rocket science; just follow the damn basics and stay consistent.
