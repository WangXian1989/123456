The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a good return on investment.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts often provide tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, if you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. The tax advantages can be significant, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals, but you’ll be taxed on any capital gains and dividends.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: When allocating funds amongst these accounts, consider your overall asset allocation strategy (stocks, bonds, etc.). Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) are often better suited for taxable accounts, while higher-growth investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you develop a strategy tailored to your specific situation.

This framework should help you effectively distribute your money amongst your retirement and taxable accounts. Always consider your unique financial goals and circumstances. If you need more specific advice or have a unique situation, feel free to ask!
