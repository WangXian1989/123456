To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) since capital gains and dividends are taxed annually.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRAs):** Hold investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in these accounts, as they're not taxed until withdrawal.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher one during retirement, consider Roth accounts to pay taxes at your current lower rate.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and asset allocation.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Strategize how you will withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes and prolong the lifespan of your investments.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach that maximizes employer contributions, leverages tax advantages, and considers your long-term financial goals is key. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
