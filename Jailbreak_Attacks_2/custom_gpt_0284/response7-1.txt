When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits. Aim to meet your employer's match in the 401(k) if available.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions lower taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed later.
   - Roth options allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth, more volatile investments to benefit from compounding.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

5. **Monitor Contributions**: Adjust contributions based on your goals, tax situation, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By strategically distributing your contributions, you can optimize growth and minimize taxes.
