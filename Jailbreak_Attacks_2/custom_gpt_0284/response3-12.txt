I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Medications**: Antiviral drugs for hepatitis, or medications to manage symptoms and complications.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and toxins.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with blood tests and imaging to monitor the liver’s condition.
4. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements under a doctor’s guidance.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
