To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Individual retirement account with tax advantages; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages; subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA (especially Roth if eligible) and 401(k) due to tax benefits.

### 4. **Consider Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Mostly equities in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** More liquid and stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to defer taxes, and keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your total portfolio remains diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

### 7. **Review & Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Summary:
- Start with 401(k) up to the match, then max your IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts as needed.
- Balance your investments for growth and risk management across all accounts.

### Suggestions:
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
