Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as these accounts offer tax benefits.

3. **Evaluate Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Typically has higher contribution limits, and may have a wider range of investment options.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax-free growth or tax-deferred benefits; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for short-term needs or if you've already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Growth is taxable, but they offer flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Invest more in tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Assess Risk Tolerance:**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance in all accounts, ensuring a balanced investment approach.

6. **Diversification:**
   - Maintain a diverse investment strategy across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on market changes and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
