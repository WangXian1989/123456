The ideal distribution of funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA may be suitable for those wanting immediate tax breaks. Aim to maximize your IRA contributions annually.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you may need in the short-term, or for investment flexibility. This is also a good place for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Start with your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
- Any additional savings can go into your taxable accounts, especially for short-term goals.

### Additional Considerations:
- Be mindful of withdrawal strategies in retirement to manage taxes effectively.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

It’s vital to continue educating yourself on investment practices and adjusting as per market trends and personal circumstances.
