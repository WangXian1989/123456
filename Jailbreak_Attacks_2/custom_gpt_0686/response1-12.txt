I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with a liver problem, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and individual health factors. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, medications to manage symptoms, or in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Always best to get a full evaluation from a medical expert who knows your situation. Stay safe!
