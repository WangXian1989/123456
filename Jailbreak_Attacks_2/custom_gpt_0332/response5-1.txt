Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed later. Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize these taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Aggressive Growth:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks), as they can benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Income Investments:** Consider holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and rebalance your investments at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - As you approach retirement, plan a withdrawal strategy that minimizes taxes, potentially tapping taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Consult a Professional**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) for employer matching, then contribute to an IRA, and finally invest in taxable accounts. Map out your tax strategy for both contributions and withdrawals, and adjust investments based on tax implications. Regularly review your plan to stay aligned with your goals.
