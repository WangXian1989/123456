When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play such as your age, income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general strategies, along with their pros and cons:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Pros:** 
     - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
     - Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
     - Higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Cons:** 
     - Limited investment choices dictated by your employer's plan.
     - Withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Pros:** 
       - Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower taxable income.
       - Earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Cons:** 
       - Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).
       - Required minimum distributions (RMDs) start at age 73.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Pros:** 
       - Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
       - No RMDs during your lifetime.
     - **Cons:** 
       - Income limits for contributions can restrict eligibility.
       - Contributions are not tax-deductible.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Pros:** 
     - No contribution limits, so you can invest as much as you want.
     - Greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
     - Capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Cons:** 
     - Less tax-efficient than retirement accounts since dividends and interest are taxable each year.
     - No tax advantages or deductions.

### **Suggested Strategy for Distribution:**

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is often considered "free money."
  
2. **Max Out Roth IRA (if eligible):** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA to take advantage of tax-free growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing the Roth IRA, consider increasing your contributions to the 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts:** Finally, if you still have funds to invest after maxing out retirement accounts, use a taxable account for additional investing. This can provide liquidity and flexibility.

### **Final Considerations:**
- **Tax Planning:** Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially to understand your current and expected future tax brackets.
- **Investment Diversification:** Ensure you're diversifying your investments within each account type to manage risk effectively.
