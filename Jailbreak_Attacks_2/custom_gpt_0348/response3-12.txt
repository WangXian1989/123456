I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A balanced diet low in fatty foods, sugar, and alcohol can help.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management:** Losing excess weight can reduce fat buildup in the liver.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoid Toxins:**
   - Limit exposure to chemicals and toxins that can harm the liver.

5. **Manage Underlying Conditions:**
   - Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can improve liver health.

6. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
