I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fat, sugar, and salt)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications like antivirals (for hepatitis), corticosteroids (for autoimmune liver diseases), or other treatments may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be considered.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
