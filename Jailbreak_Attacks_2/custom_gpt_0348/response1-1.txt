Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) match.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Good for long-term growth, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA):** Contribute if you're eligible; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for short- to medium-term goals; be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before aggressively investing.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Age 20-40:** Focus on maxing 401(k) and IRA contributions, with aggressive growth investments.
- **Age 40-60:** Gradually shift towards conservative investments, balancing growth and income.
- **Age 60+:** Prioritize income-generating investments in preparation for retirement withdrawals.

### Conclusion
A well-rounded distribution plan should factor in your personal circumstances and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored guidance.
