I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you see a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Treatment for liver problems varies widely depending on the specific condition and severity. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications specifically for the liver condition, or in severe cases, surgical interventions. Always consult with a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
