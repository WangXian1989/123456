The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). The contribution limits for IRAs can be lower than 401(k)s, but they offer tax advantages that can be beneficial.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed to your IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions if you're still under the contribution limits, as these accounts also provide tax-deferred growth. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've optimized your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options, which can be helpful for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments. For instance, holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable accounts can help minimize tax burdens. Conversely, consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you maintain a proper asset allocation (mix of stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. You can adjust the asset allocation differently across accounts to cater to their specific tax treatments.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
