When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon matter. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which grows tax-free.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - Distributions from these accounts in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider the Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices, so consider their expense ratios and performance.
   - IRAs generally provide a wider array of investment options.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Prioritize Emergency Funds**:
   - Ensure you have adequate funds in accessible accounts (like a savings account) before investing heavily in retirement accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances, market conditions, and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.

It's essential to align your plan with your overall retirement strategy and to review it regularly. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
