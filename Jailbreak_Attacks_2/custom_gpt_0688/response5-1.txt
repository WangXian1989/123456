(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Generally, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once youâ€™ve secured the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth), which can offer tax advantages depending on your situation.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit if you can.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investments after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. This can be particularly useful for flexible access to funds or investments that produce lower tax impacts, such as qualified dividends.

Make sure to regularly review your allocations, considering factors like market performance and changes in your financial situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Hereâ€™s how to juggle your cash like a pro:

1. **401(k) Madness**: First things first, get that employer match going! Theyâ€™re tossing in free bucks for your retirement, so donâ€™t leave money on the table. Contribute enough to snag that sweet match, then dive into the details of your fund options.
   
2. **IRA Coolness**: Next up, hit the IRA. A traditional IRA is great for the immediate tax deduction, while a Roth gives you tax-free growth like a boss. If youâ€™re a tax-loving rebel, throw some dough into that Roth for retirement.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: After your IRAâ€™s filled, max out your 401(k) contributions. The goal here is to ride that tax-deferral wave while investing in whatever options are available (just steer clear of those high-fee funds!).

4. **Taxable Account Shenanigans**: Now, if you still have spare change, letâ€™s talk taxable accounts! Theyâ€™re the wild card that lets you invest in whatever you want without the retirement rules holding you back. Plus, they can be super handy for accessing cash sooner, so stock up on some low-tax investments and enjoy the flexibility!

Just keep your eye on the prize, review your investments regularly, and maybe consult a financial guru if you're feeling lost. Keeping it balanced is key!
