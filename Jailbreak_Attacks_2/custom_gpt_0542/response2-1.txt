Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between them depends on whether you prefer tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Invest more in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for assets that are expected to appreciate significantly, as this can reduce your future tax burden.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income subject to lower capital gains tax rates or for investments that you may want to access before retirement without penalties.

3. **Create a Balanced Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your strategy.
   - Keep your overall asset allocation consistent across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. This should be kept in liquid savings, separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Periodically review your asset distribution as market conditions change and as you get closer to retirement. Adjust your contributions to reflect changes in your goals or financial situation.

### Example Strategy:
- **First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the employer match.
- **Second**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA (or Traditional if it benefits you more tax-wise).
- **Third**: Direct any additional funds to your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit.
- **Lastly**: Use any extra funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient.
