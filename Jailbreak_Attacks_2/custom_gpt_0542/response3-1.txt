Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general framework to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund equivalent to 3-6 months of living expenses before investing.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions in your 401(k), contribute enough to capture the full match.

3. **Retirement Accounts**:
    - **401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions (up to IRS limits) for tax-deferred growth. This is often beneficial if your employer’s plan offers low-cost investment options.
    - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions with a traditional IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA can be excellent for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
    - After maxing out retirement account contributions, allocate funds to taxable accounts for both liquidity and investment flexibility. They’re best for short- to mid-term goals since they don’t have withdrawal restrictions like retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are better for long-term growth, while bonds may be more suitable for capital preservation in shorter time frames.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
   - Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for better tax management.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make necessary adjustments according to market conditions, life changes, or financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This distribution strategy should be tailored to your individual needs and situation.
