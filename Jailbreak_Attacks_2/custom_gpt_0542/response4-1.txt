Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general framework to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice between the two depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing significant amounts.

### 4. **Debt Management**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Aim to have a balanced investment strategy that considers:
     - **Risk Tolerance**: Higher risk may require more equity, while lower risk may favor bonds.
     - **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons can afford more volatility.

### 6. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) and strategies to minimize capital gains tax.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 10% (contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 75% (after maxing out tax-advantaged options)

### Conclusion
There is no one-size-fits-all answer. It’s essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon, possibly in consultation with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy.
