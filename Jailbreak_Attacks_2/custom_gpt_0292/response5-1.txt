The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Consider Tax Impact**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains. Bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts if they generate interest income.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might prioritize growth assets, while older investors might focus on preservation and income.

6. **Review Regularly**: Investment strategies should evolve based on changes in income, market conditions, and tax laws.
