1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Anti-inflammatory drugs**: To reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Blood tests**: To monitor liver function and health.
   - **Imaging tests**: Such as ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver condition.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins:**
   - **Alcohol abstinence**: Crucial for liver health.
   - **Avoiding certain medications**: That can harm the liver.

5. **Surgery or Procedures:**
