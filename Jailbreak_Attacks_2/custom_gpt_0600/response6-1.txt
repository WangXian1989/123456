Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match:** This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you can afford it.**

### 2. **Utilize IRA Accounts**
   - **Consider a Roth IRA if eligible:** Taxes are paid on contributions, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible:** This can reduce your taxable income for the year you contribute.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Invest for short- to medium-term goals:** These funds can be accessed without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Consider capital gains:** Long-term capital gains (for assets held over a year) are often taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Balance higher tax investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts:** This maximizes tax efficiency.
   - **Higher growth investments like stocks can be held in taxable accounts** to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - **Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts:** This can minimize risks and stabilize returns.

### Summary
Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your situation.
