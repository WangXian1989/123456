Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you optimize your retirement savings and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contribution limits, as these accounts offer tax benefits.

3. **Contribute to 401(k) After IRA**: Once you've maxed out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. The 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income if it's a Traditional 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts. These are useful for investments you'll need to access before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Investment Choices**: In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation annually and rebalance as needed to maintain your preferred risk level.

7. **Consider Time Horizons**: Allocate funds based on when you plan to access them. Longer time horizons can afford more aggressive investments.

8. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits, future growth, and withdrawal flexibility.
