Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are general guidelines to help you strategize:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any available employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out based on your financial situation.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer pre-tax contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: There are annual limits (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, with a catch-up contribution for those 50 and older). Aim to max out if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Contributions**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for further investing.
   - **Flexibility**: They offer access to funds without penalties, which can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund equivalent to 3-6 months of living expenses before heavy investing.
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes to manage risk.
   - **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocation based on changes in financial goals or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances and exact tax situation.
