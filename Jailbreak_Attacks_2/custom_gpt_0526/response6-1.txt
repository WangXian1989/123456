To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Maximize Contributions:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available).
     - After the match, consider maximizing your IRA contributions for the tax benefits.
   - **Prioritize Roth IRAs:** If you're eligible, these accounts allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**
   - **401(k):** Generally suitable for tax-deferred growth, consider holding a mix of equities and fixed income based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA:** Depending on if it's traditional or Roth, use for long-term growth investments like stocks or bond funds, benefiting from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for holding investments that might generate capital gains taxes; consider lower-turnover investments or tax-efficient funds.

### 3. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation annually based on performance and changes in your investment strategy or financial goals.

This framework helps optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time. For personalized advice, consulting with a financial advisor is often beneficial.
