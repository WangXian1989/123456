Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current income, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: Allocate a portion of your income to a 401(k) and an IRA (Traditional or Roth). 
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you are looking for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Fund a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Assess Needs for Taxable Accounts**: If you have investments beyond your retirement accounts, consider a taxable account for:
   - Short-term goals (e.g., buying a home, travel).
   - Flexibility (taxable accounts have fewer penalties for withdrawals).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment choices within these accounts are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - In a taxable account, focus on investments that generate capital gains over interest income to minimize taxes.
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, consider higher-growth investments since they grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Review your allocations periodically and adjust as necessary based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking to a financial advisor.

This strategy aims to balance tax efficiency, liquidity for short-term needs, and long-term growth potential.
