Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if you can. This can reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, which is beneficial if you need to lower your current taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you plan to access before retirement. This gives you flexibility without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, which may be less tax-burdened.

4. **Balanced Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within those classes.
   - Adjust your allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Revisit and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy. Life changes, market conditions, and your goals can all affect your distribution.

Ultimately, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
