Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year of contribution. Consider using this account for higher-growth investments since withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free during retirement. Roth IRAs can be particularly beneficial for younger investors expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should contain investments that are less sensitive to capital gains taxes, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs. Consider holding bonds or high-income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate your more aggressive investments (stocks, growth funds) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Hold more stable investments (bonds, cash equivalents) in your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial goals or situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances.
