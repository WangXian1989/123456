To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be beneficial for tax deduction purposes now.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** Stay within the annual contribution limits (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Capital Gains Awareness:** Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to take advantage of lower tax rates.

### **Overall Considerations:**
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailored advice based on your unique financial situation can optimize your investment strategy.

By strategically distributing funds across these accounts, you can optimize tax benefits, grow your portfolio, and provide liquidity for short-term needs.
