Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal, or a Roth if you anticipate a higher bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: Consider income limits and your current vs. expected future tax situation. 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim for the annual limit, especially in a Roth for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals since there are no penalties for withdrawal.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, focusing on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a liquid account before investing heavily.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level.
