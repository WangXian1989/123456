Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you need immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA might be better.

### 3. **Utilize Tax-Deferred Accounts First**
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA before contributing significantly to taxable accounts. These accounts provide tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Maintain a liquid emergency fund in taxable accounts to cover immediate needs or unexpected expenses.

### 5. **Balance Growth and Risk**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and goals. Allocate a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts, adjusting the ratio based on your timeline and risk appetite.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market changes.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute to the limit, especially if there’s an employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out what you can contribute.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maximizing 401(k)/IRA contributions in a diversified portfolio.
