Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for assets that generate income, as dividends and interest are taxed at ordinary rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold investments that appreciate in value, like stocks, to avoid immediate capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Determine Your Investment Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easier access without penalty.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation to maintain your desired risk level.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts (401(k), IRA).**
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity needs.** 

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your unique situation.
