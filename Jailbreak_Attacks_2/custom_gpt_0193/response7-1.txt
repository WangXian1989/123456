To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide additional tax advantages depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings after maxing out your retirement accounts. This offers flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals or emergency funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on market performance and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
