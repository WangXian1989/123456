Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: If you can afford it, maximize contributions here due to higher limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement; otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which are lower than those for 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Post-Retirement Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money that you may need before retirement or for goals like buying a home.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Approach:
- Start with your 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Max out an IRA (traditional or Roth, based on your tax strategy).
- If you have additional funds, increase your 401(k) contributions or invest in a taxable account.

### Periodic Reassessment:
- Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your changing financial circumstances and goals.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your individual situation. 

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
