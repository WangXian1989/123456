Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: An employer-sponsored plan that often includes employer matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. You can choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (taxed now, tax-free later) options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in brokerage accounts where earnings are subject to capital gains tax and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, contribute to your IRA next. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 4. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - After maxing out employer matching and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you hit the contribution limit. The limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and no contribution limits.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds and high-turnover funds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on shifting goals, market performance, and changes in financial situations.

### 8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider getting personalized advice from a financial advisor, especially regarding complex tax strategies and long-term planning.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy varies for each individual, but starting with maximizing employer contributions, followed by prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts, and then considering taxable accounts is a general guideline that many find effective. Always tailor your approach based on personal circumstances.
