To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to maximize contributions.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, maximize your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and goals).

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now (for traditional) but taxes will be owed on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on the profits. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) in all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA).

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Monitor your investments regularly and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Take Advantage of Tax Loss Harvesting**:
   - In taxable accounts, consider selling losing investments to offset gains, potentially reducing your tax burden.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially considering your specific financial situation and goals, consulting a professional can provide tailored strategies.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
