Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing this out if your employer offers a match. It reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out the above accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These are flexible but come with capital gains taxes. Use them for shorter-term goals or investments you might need to access sooner.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Consider Taxes**: Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

6. **Evaluate & Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in financial goals, or life events.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances can also be beneficial.
