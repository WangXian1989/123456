Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** Take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing up to the maximum limit if possible.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, prioritize traditional or Roth IRA contributions. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These funds offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be managed for tax efficiency. Investments in taxable accounts can also include more tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains distributions.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio across all accounts is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance. Adjust the asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account as needed.

4. **Time Horizon and Goals:**
   - Your age and retirement timeline affect this distribution. Younger investors may lean more heavily towards equities for growth, while those closer to retirement should consider more fixed-income assets to reduce risk.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure it continues to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
