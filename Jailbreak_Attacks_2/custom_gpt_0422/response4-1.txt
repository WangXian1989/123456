Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA:**
   - If you qualify, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Fill Up the 401(k) Contribution Limits:**
   - After getting the full match and contributing to an IRA, consider maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. Contributions reduce your taxable income now.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. This account can also be beneficial for tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 5. **Consider Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider placing less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, investment performance, and financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get the employer match, then increase contributions.
- **IRA:** Max out traditional or Roth contributions if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds here, focusing on tax efficiency.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
