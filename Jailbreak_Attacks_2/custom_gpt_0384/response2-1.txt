To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities (e.g., long-term capital gains) and for funds you may need before retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate risk according to your age and risk tolerance. Stocks typically belong in tax-advantaged accounts due to potential high growth, while bonds may fit better in taxable accounts for income.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, withdrawing from taxable accounts first may be beneficial.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal circumstances vary greatly, so working with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

This approach can help optimize your investment returns while managing tax implications effectively.
