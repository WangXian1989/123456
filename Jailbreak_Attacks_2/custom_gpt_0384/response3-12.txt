I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopt a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications might be prescribed.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies.
4. **Hepatitis Treatment**: If hepatitis is the issue, antiviral medications may be used.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy or liver transplant may be necessary.

Always discuss your options with a healthcare provider tailored to your specific condition.
