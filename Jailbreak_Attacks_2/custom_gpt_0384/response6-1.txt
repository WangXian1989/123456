To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments that generate taxable income (e.g., bonds) to optimize growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on **long-term capital gains** in taxable accounts by holding investments for over a year.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across different asset classes in all accounts to manage risk.
   - Maintain a balanced allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to stay in line with your investment goals and market conditions.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid penalties for early withdrawals.

By prioritizing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
