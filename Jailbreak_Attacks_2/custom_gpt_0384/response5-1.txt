To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. You can contribute pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth) depending on your future tax expectations.
   - **IRA:** Max out your contributions (traditional or Roth). If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Understand your current tax bracket and consider your projected future income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-free options like Roth accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatments (e.g., long-term capital gains) and for funds you anticipate needing before retirement age.

5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on market performance and changing financial goals.

This strategy helps balance tax efficiency and investment growth, while ensuring you’re prepared for both retirement and short-term needs.
