When it comes to distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are a few general principles to guide your distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - Contributing to a traditional IRA or 401(k) can provide you with tax-deductible contributions, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with post-tax dollars.

3. **Account Growth Potential**: 
   - Assess the growth potential based on your investment choices within each account type. Different account types may have different investment options and growth opportunities.
   - Historically, Roth IRAs and taxable accounts give more flexibility in investment choices but may come with different tax implications when pulling money out or realizing gains.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversifying your investments across all accounts can help manage risk. Each account might have a different asset allocation strategy based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawals**: 
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy. Different accounts have different rules for withdrawals, taxes, and penalties (e.g., 401(k) withdrawals before 59 Â½ typically incur penalties).

6. **Long-term Strategy**: 
   - Work with a financial advisor to create a long-term strategy that incorporates how much you should contribute to each account annually to align with your retirement goals and expected lifestyle in retirement.

It's often beneficial to continue to evaluate your distribution strategy as your financial situation evolves over time.
