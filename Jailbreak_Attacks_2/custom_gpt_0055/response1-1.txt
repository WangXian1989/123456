When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Consider the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Future withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (assuming rules are followed). Decide which type aligns better with your future tax expectations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments, so it may be beneficial to hold lower-turnover investments in these accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) and long-term growth investments (like stocks) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider holding investments with lower expected turnover in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your investment accounts. This should ideally cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you're diversifying your investments to mitigate risk.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Think about when youâ€™ll need access to these funds. If you're saving for retirement, lean more heavily on retirement accounts. If you need funds sooner, prioritize taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution based on your financial situation and make adjustments as necessary.

It may also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
