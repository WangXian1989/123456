Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in these accounts are subjected to capital gains tax. They offer more flexibility but less tax advantage.

3. **Balance Your Asset Allocation**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate investments differently across accounts. For instance, you might want more aggressive investments in your taxable account and more conservative ones in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider your withdrawal strategy. Generally, funds in taxable accounts might be accessed first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often helpful to discuss your specific situation with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your unique circumstances and future goals.
