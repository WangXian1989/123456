The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to at least get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you are eligible for tax-deductible contributions to a Traditional IRA, consider funding this account next. Alternatively, if you're eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, while 401(k) and IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income. Knowing your current and expected future tax brackets can help you decide.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on the types of investments you wish to hold, you may want to consider holding bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Conversely, holding stocks that you expect to appreciate in value in taxable accounts may be beneficial due to more favorable capital gains tax rates.

5. **Long-term vs. Short-term Needs**: Consider your liquidity needs. Money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA withdrawals may incur taxes and penalties if taken before age 59Â½ (with certain exceptions).

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type.

Lastly, it is often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your personal circumstances best.
