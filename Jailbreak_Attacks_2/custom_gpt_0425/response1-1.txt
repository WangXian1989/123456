Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a basic breakdown to help guide your strategy:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider this if you're in a higher tax bracket now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Great for accessible funds not tied up in retirement accounts. You can withdraw funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: You'll pay capital gains tax on any investment profits, so investing in tax-efficient funds can help manage this.

### General Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- **Prioritize Roth Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Back to 401(k)**: After your IRA, go back to your 401(k) and contribute more until you hit your maximum contribution limit.
- **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in taxable accounts if you have spare cash after maxing out retirement accounts, focusing on long-term investments that are tax-efficient.

This balance ensures you minimize taxes, maximize benefits, and maintain access to your funds as needed. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation!
