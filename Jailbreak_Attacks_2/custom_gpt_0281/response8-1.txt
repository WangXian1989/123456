Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing to your 401(k) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Use traditional funds if you want pre-tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're closer to retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for early withdrawals but remember they’re subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversifying investments across all accounts to balance risk and growth. 

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations regularly, especially as your income, expenses, or financial goals change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
