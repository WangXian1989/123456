To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and goals. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After your IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement or for specific goals. Concentrate on investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, broader asset allocation across accounts provides better risk management. For example, you might hold more stocks in your taxable account and more bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor this strategy to your specific needs and goals.
