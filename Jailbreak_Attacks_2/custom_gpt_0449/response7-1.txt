Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and the time horizon for your investments. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to at least get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax-deferred Growth:** 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income now, making it a good option if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Types of IRAs:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The Roth option is attractive if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you're aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and take advantage of any catch-up provisions if you're 50 or older.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Taxable accounts are good for short-term goals or if you need access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

### **Strategy:**
1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k):** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
2. **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Once you've secured the match, focus on maxing out IRA contributions, especially if you can use a Roth IRA.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional investment flexibility.

### **Rebalance and Review:**
- Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

### **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
- It's often beneficial to seek personalized advice from a financial advisor who can consider your unique financial situation.

By balancing contributions based on these factors, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
