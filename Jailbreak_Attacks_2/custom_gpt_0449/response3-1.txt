Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a strategic approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with potential matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, limited investment choices. Ideal for high contributions and employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Offers tax advantages; Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility and liquidity without contribution limits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out 401(k) to Get Employer Match:** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions next, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Savings:** Any extra funds can go into a taxable account, especially if youâ€™ll need access to the money before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to recover taxes later.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (bonds) or those that generate taxable income (dividend stocks), as they can be taxed at favorable rates.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Review your allocation periodically; market conditions and your financial situation may change.
   - Rebalance your portfolio as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, working with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.

In summary, start by maximizing employer contributions to your 401(k), then prioritize your IRA, and lastly fund taxable accounts as needed, while keeping a keen eye on asset allocation and tax implications. Always adapt your strategy as your situation evolves.
