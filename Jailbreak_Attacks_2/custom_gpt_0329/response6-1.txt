Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any company match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) if eligible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for short-term goals or if you have reached contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer-term investments should lean towards retirement accounts, while shorter-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing goals, market conditions, or tax regulations.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your tax efficiency and overall investment growth.
