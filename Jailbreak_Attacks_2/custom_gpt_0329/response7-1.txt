Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategies. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest here for flexibility. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Timing**
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are taxed as ordinary income, impacting retirement tax strategies.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Rebalance your allocations periodically based on changes in financial goals, market performance, and tax laws.

By focusing on maximizing tax benefits and maintaining a diversified portfolio, you can effectively manage your investments across these accounts.
