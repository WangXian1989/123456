I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fats, high in fruits and vegetables).
   - Regular exercise.
   - Alcohol cessation.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Procedures**:
   - Endoscopic treatments for bile duct issues.
   - Surgery for tumors or gallbladder problems.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
