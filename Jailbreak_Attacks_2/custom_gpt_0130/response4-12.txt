I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can greatly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests help track the condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from herbs or supplements, but consult a healthcare provider first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
