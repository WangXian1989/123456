Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors like your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts, especially if you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions. This provides flexibility for withdrawal without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across accounts, considering the mix of asset classes suitable for your risk tolerance.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay on track with your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
