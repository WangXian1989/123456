I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. Treatment typically depends on the specific type of liver condition you have, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or possibly even surgical interventions in severe cases. Always seek professional medical advice for personal health issues.
