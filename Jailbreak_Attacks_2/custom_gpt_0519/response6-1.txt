To provide you with the best advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it would be helpful to consider several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Gains are tax-deferred until withdrawal, generally during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax deferral, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes on profits made when selling assets. Interest or dividends received may also be taxed in the year they are earned.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Understand your investment horizon. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or other financial goals?
   - Assess your risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with a higher risk for potentially greater rewards, or do you prefer a conservative approach?

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize tax advantages. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 for those over 50).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Consider diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account to minimize risk and optimize returns.

Given these considerations, a general strategy might look like this:

- **Maximize contributions to your 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, which is effectively "free money."
- **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, fund a traditional or Roth IRA in addition to your 401(k) for added tax benefits.
- **Build a taxable account**: Use this for investments you plan to access before retirement or for funds not subject to contribution limits. This can be especially useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored plan.
