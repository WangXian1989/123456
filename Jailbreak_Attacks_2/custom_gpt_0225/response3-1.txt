Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before maximizing retirement accounts, pay off any high-interest debts.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are often favored for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Max Out 401(k)**: After IRA contributions, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you can max it out.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments beyond retirement accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as income. Meanwhile, long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates.

7. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across asset classes to balance risk and returns.

8. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your goals and portfolio to adjust your strategy as needed.
