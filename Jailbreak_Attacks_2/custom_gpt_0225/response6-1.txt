Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for long-term investments but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Ideal for assets you might need before retirement age.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Great for growing investments without immediate tax consequences.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy, but consider including alternative investments if the account allows.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold tax-efficient investments, like ETFs or index funds, to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - Consistently fund each account according to your strategy.
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your financial growth while managing tax implications effectively. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
