I'm not a doctor, but I can help outline some common treatment options for liver issues. Here are a few:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Nutritional Supplements**: Some supplements like vitamin E may be recommended, but consult a healthcare provider first.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reduce exposure to harmful substances that can worsen liver issues.

6. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies or even liver transplants might be necessary.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific diagnosis and health condition.
