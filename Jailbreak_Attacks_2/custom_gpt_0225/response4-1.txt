To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure high-interest debts are managed and maintain an emergency fund before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Assess your financial goals and timeline. Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term growth can occur in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance. Higher growth investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable assets might fit better in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
