To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, your contributions may either be tax-deductible now (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in these accounts, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize Growth Accounts**: If you're younger and in a lower tax bracket, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

4. **Diverse Investment Approach**: Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts can be advantageous for flexible withdrawals before retirement age, while tax-advantaged accounts are typically for long-term goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically revisit your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Ultimately, the best allocation depends on your financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
