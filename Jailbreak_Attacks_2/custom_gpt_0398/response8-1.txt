Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds after maximizing retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This is beneficial for flexibility and can be used for short- and medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess and adjust your investments and contributions as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting a financial advisor is wise for personalized advice.
