To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize employer match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest extra funds here, especially for flexibility and liquidity.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks), which can provide favorable tax treatment.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains tax in taxable accounts. Hold investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.
   - In your tax-advantaged accounts, focus on growth-heavy investments that generate high returns over time.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and your financial goals to maintain your desired risk level.

5. **Debt Management**:
   - Consider paying down high-interest debt before aggressively investing, as the return on paying off debt may exceed investment returns.

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.
