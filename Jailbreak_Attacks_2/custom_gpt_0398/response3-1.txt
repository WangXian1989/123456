Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Max out your IRA** (Roth or Traditional) after contributing enough to your 401(k). IRAs offer tax advantages that can compound over time.

3. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Contributions lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. This can include investments that you may need to access before retirement or that generate capital gains which can be taxed favorably.

5. **Investment Strategy:** 
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid interest income being taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** 
   - Review and adjust your portfolio periodically based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consider Your Timeline:** 
   - If you have a long time until retirement, prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
