Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can hold investments subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals. Taxable accounts might be better for short-term needs, while retirement accounts are for long-term growth.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique situation!
