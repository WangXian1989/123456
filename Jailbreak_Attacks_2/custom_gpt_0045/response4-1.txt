When distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer matches first for free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible.
   
2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments here to minimize capital gains tax.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align investments with your timeline. Long-term can afford risk, short-term should be more conservative.
   - Diversify across asset classes to manage risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess and adjust your allocations to maintain desired risk levels.

5. **Consider Fees**:
   - Pay attention to expense ratios in each account and aim for low-cost options.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves outside of these investments.
