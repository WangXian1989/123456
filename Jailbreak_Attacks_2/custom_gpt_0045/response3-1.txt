Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your current age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match first; this is essentially "free money."
   - Consider contributing up to the annual limit if possible for tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Prioritize Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments.
   - Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains to minimize taxes (stocks, ETFs) over short-term ones (frequent trading).

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Aggressive Risk Tolerance**: 60% 401(k), 30% IRA, 10% Taxable.
- **Moderate Risk Tolerance**: 50% 401(k), 30% IRA, 20% Taxable.
- **Conservative Risk Tolerance**: 40% 401(k), 40% IRA, 20% Taxable.

### Considerations:
- Evaluate fees and expenses associated with each account type.
- Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before aggressively investing.
- Reassess allocations periodically based on life changes or market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique situation.
