To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first. For 2024, the maximum contribution is $23,000 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRA (with catch-up contributions available for those over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate lower capital gains, or consider holding tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly adjust your allocations to maintain your desired investment strategy across all account types.

6. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan how you’ll withdraw funds efficiently to minimize tax impact.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
