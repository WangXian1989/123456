Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions if you’re eligible, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid frequent trading to reduce short-term capital gains.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds).

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**:
   - Regularly adjust your investments in each account to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Long-Term Considerations**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline. If retirement is far off, focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, consider a more conservative approach.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and focusing on tax efficiency, you can optimize your investment strategy across these accounts.
