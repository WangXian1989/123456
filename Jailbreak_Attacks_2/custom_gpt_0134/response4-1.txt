I'm not a financial advisor, but here are some general strategies for distributing your money effectively across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. This can help reduce your taxable income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed, but you can strategically sell investments to manage capital gains.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside before maximizing retirement contributions.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
