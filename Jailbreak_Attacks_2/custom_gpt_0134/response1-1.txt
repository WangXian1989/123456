Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment timeframe. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After the employer match, consider contributing more to your 401(k) if you’re in a higher tax bracket. This will lower your current taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. These provide liquidity and are more flexible for withdrawals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts. For example, you can hold high-growth stocks in your retirement accounts (where taxes on growth aren’t an issue), while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing funds in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, leaving Roth accounts for last.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.
