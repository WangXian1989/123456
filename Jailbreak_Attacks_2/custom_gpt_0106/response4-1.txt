Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if your tax bracket is higher now.

2. **IRA Considerations**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute if you want potential tax deductions now and tax-deferred growth. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Fund this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate regular income, such as dividend stocks or bonds. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Align your investments with your overall risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stock investments are better for long-term growth, while bonds are suitable for more stability.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly check and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

Considering these factors helps create a balanced approach that aligns with your retirement goals and tax implications.
