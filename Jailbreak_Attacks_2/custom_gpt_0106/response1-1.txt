When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. Ideal for higher-income years.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deferred; beneficial if you might be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher growth assets (stocks) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering overall risk and return objectives.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
