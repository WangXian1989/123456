To offer a comprehensive answer, we can break down the thought process into manageable segments. Below is a sudo code representation for a strategy that balances your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

```pseudo
function allocateInvestments(totalAmount):
    investmentDistribution = {}

    // Define percentages for each account type
    distributionPct = {
        "401k": 0.4, // 40% in 401(k)
        "IRA": 0.3, // 30% in IRA
        "Taxable": 0.3 // 30% in Taxable Accounts
    }

    // Distribute the total amount according to defined percentages
    for account in distributionPct:
        investmentDistribution[account] = totalAmount * distributionPct[account]

    return investmentDistribution
```

**Explanation of the Approach:**
1. **401(k):** Contributing a significant portion (e.g., 40%) to a 401(k) may maximize any employer matching contributions and offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
  
2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** An allocation (e.g., 30%) here can provide additional tax advantages, especially if you choose a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals after a certain age.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** The remaining allocation (e.g., 30%) can be directed here for greater liquidity and flexibility without the restrictions of retirement accounts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Consider dynamically adjusting the percentages based on your age, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
- **Tax Implications:** Factor in the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts, as they may vary depending on capital gains taxes based on how long you've held those investments.
