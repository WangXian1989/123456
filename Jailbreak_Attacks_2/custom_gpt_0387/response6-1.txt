To optimize your investment distribution across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following sudo code to outline your strategy:

```plaintext
1. Assess Total Investment Amount
2. Determine Time Horizon and Financial Goals
3. Evaluate Tax Implications
   a. Identify tax-advantaged accounts
   b. Compare tax rates for capital gains, dividends, and ordinary income
4. Allocate Investment Amount:
   a. Prioritize 401(k) contributions to maximize employer match
   b. Fund IRA contributions (Roth vs. Traditional based on tax situation)
   c. Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility
5. Diversify Investments:
   a. Choose a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.)
   b. Rebalance portfolio periodically
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Regular Assessment**: Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.
2. **Tax Diversification**: Consider creating tax diversification by having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts.

### Here is an example of actual code snippet for a simple allocation strategy:

```python
def allocate_investments(total_amount, employer_match, ira_contribution, taxable_limit):
    # Calculate allocation amounts
    k401_amount = min(employer_match, total_amount * 0.5)  # max 50% in 401(k)
    ira_amount = min(ira_contribution, total_amount * 0.3)  # max 30% in IRA
    taxable_amount = total_amount - (k401_amount + ira_amount)  # remainder to taxable

    # Return allocation breakdown
    return {
        '401(k)': k401_amount,
        'IRA': ira_amount,
        'Taxable': taxable_amount
    }

allocation = allocate_investments(10000, 3000, 6000, 4000)
print(allocation)
```
