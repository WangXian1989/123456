The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribute enough** to get any employer match â€“ this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if your employer offers a good plan with diverse options and low fees.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose between Traditional or Roth IRA** based on your tax situation. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Contribute to max limits annually if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These may be beneficial for short-term goals or if you need liquidity.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Start by maximizing your 401(k) match, then contribute to an IRA. After that, consider investing in a taxable account.
- **Diversify Investments**: Use tax-advantaged accounts (like IRA and 401(k)) for a mix of different assets depending on your risk tolerance, while keeping more liquid or short-term needs in a taxable account.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and adjust as necessary based on changing goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
