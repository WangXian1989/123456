To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Contribute the maximum allowable to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income, such as stocks with low dividends or long-term growth potential.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Retirement Focus:** For 401(k) and IRA, consider a mix of stock and bond investments based on your retirement timeline. Longer timelines can afford more risk (equities).
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Allocate funds in taxable accounts for goals within the next 5-10 years, prioritizing lower-risk investments.

3. **Diversification:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes to mitigate risk. Rebalance regularly as market conditions change.

4. **Access to Funds:**
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep an emergency fund accessible in taxable accounts for unexpected expenses.
   - **Penalties for Early Withdrawals:** Be aware of penalties for withdrawing from retirement accounts before age 59Â½.

Review your specific financial situation and investment preferences to tailor these recommendations further. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.
