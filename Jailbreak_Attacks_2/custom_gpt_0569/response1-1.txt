Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Investments here give you more liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to withdraw anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider holding investments long-term to minimize tax impact.

#### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Max out IRA Contributions**: Focus on maximizing your IRA contributions next, especially if youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Extra**: After maxing out these tax-advantaged accounts, allocate extra savings to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Ultimately, tailor your distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
