To determine the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals, making them useful if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxation in the year they are realized. Consider holding assets with lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: If you have a long-term horizon (like retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize compound growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: For near-term liquidity needs, prioritize taxable accounts, as they allow easier access to funds without penalties.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match (if available) as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out IRA contributions after addressing your 401(k).

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, with a mix of growth, income, and possibly defensive investments across all accounts, using tax-advantaged accounts for riskier investments due to their potential for higher growth.

### Suggested Action Plan:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) for the full employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. If you prefer the tax deduction, consider a Traditional IRA.
- **Balance with Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

### Regular Review:
- **Evaluate Annually**: Review your strategy annually to adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and goals.

This balanced approach allows for tax efficiency while working towards your long-term financial goals.
