When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if it offers an employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Depending on your income and eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - Assess your tax situation to determine which account aligns with your goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Utilize taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments that may generate significant taxable income, like dividends.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy:
- Start with employer-sponsored plans to take advantage of matches.
- Diversify your contributions based on your tax situation, future withdrawal strategy, and investment timeframe.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
