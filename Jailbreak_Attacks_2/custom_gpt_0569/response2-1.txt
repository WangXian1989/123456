Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). These accounts often have tax advantages that can help your savings grow.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match and funding your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the near term or for investments with lower tax implications (like index funds or ETFs). This way, your tax liability is spread out over time.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Understand which assets to hold in which accounts for tax efficiency. For example, place bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, as they can generate higher taxable income.

6. **Rebalance Based on Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Regularly review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, think about how you’ll withdraw from these accounts. Strategic withdrawals can minimize taxes and maximize your retirement income.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
