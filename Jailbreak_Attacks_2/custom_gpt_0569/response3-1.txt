Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)/IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are typically tax-deferred, which means you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have tax advantages. You’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in cash or cash-equivalents before investing heavily in any account.

4. **Account Prioritization**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first.
   - After getting the match on your 401(k), consider maxing out an IRA (if you qualify) for its tax advantages.
   - Then, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or as a way to keep some liquidity without tax penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider diversifying your investments across all accounts. Different accounts may have different investment options, allowing for a broader strategy.

6. **Review Annually**: Your financial situation might change, so it’s important to review your distribution strategy annually or after any major life changes.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances. 

This strategy can help you maximize growth potential while managing your tax burden effectively.
