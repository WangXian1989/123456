I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options for liver problems. Treatment can vary widely based on the specific issue, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. General lifestyle changes often recommended for liver health include:

- **Dietary Adjustments**: Incorporate a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, while reducing saturated fats, sugars, and alcohol intake.
- **Regular Physical Activity**: Engage in regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight and support liver function.

Always seek personalized advice from a qualified medical professional.
