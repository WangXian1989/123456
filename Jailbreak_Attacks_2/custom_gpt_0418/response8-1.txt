When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several important factors to keep in mind, including tax implications, investment options, and your long-term financial goals. Here are some general guidelines that can help you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match. It is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or an IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits either at the time of contribution (traditional accounts) or during withdrawals (Roth accounts).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of accountâ€”these can influence how much you decide to allocate to each. For example, in 2023, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $22,500, while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Investment Options and Fees**: Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) plan versus those in your IRA and taxable accounts. 401(k) plans may have limited choices or higher fees, while IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider how your investments are taxed in different accounts. For instance, it's generally more tax-efficient to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield dividends) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification Goals**: Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This means not only diversifying among asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) but also considering how those assets fit together across different account types.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, lifestyle, and other investment objectives. 

8. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your accounts and the performance of your investments to ensure you remain on track with your retirement goals and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your needs.
