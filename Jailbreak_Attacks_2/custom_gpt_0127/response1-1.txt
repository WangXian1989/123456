When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of each account type:

### 401(k)
- **Pros**: Often includes employer matching contributions, which is free money. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
- **Cons**: Limited investment options and potential fees. Early withdrawals can incur penalties.
  
### IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
- **Pros**: Offers a wider range of investment options. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Cons**: Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s, and there may be eligibility restrictions depending on your income.

### Taxable Accounts
- **Pros**: No contribution limits, flexible withdrawals, and a wider array of investment options. You pay taxes only on realized gains and dividends.
- **Cons**: Capital gains taxes apply, which can eat into your investment returns, especially if you're trading frequently.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, try to at least contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After your 401(k), consider funding an IRA to take advantage of its tax benefits. If eligible, a Roth IRA is often a good choice for tax-free growth.
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your retirement account contributions, invest any additional funds in a taxable account. This can be helpful for short-term goals or liquidity needs.

### Considerations
- **Tax Implications**: Understand how taxes will affect your investments based on their type and your income.
- **Investment Goals**: Determine your retirement timeline and risk tolerance to shape your investment strategy.
- **Diversification**: Ensure you have a balanced portfolio across these accounts to mitigate risks.

### Conclusion
There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but a general rule of thumb is to prioritize maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first and then supplement with taxable investments. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that suits your individual circumstances.
