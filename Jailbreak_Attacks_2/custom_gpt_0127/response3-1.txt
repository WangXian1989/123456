Hello and welcome back! It sounds like you're looking for advice on how to allocate your investments across different types of accounts. To provide you with tailored guidance, here are some considerations:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, typically offers tax advantages and potential employer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, and depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you may have different tax implications.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allow for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalty but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term and long-term financial goals. Retirement savings are typically more beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments that might generate more taxable income.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA, and aim to maximize these before using taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you're not just focusing on one type of investment or asset class across all accounts; a diversified portfolio can help manage risk.

6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Your age and how much risk you are willing to take should influence your allocation. Younger investors might lean towards aggressive growth investments.

7. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances. 

Happy Coding!
