(üîíNormal Output) The optimal way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of any employer match first. Contributing enough to get the full match is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions to your IRA if you are eligible, especially since contributions can reduce your taxable income.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. This can be beneficial for shorter-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to assess your individual circumstances.

1. **Max Out That 401(k)**: Hit up that employer match first‚Äîgrab that free money! It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúHere, have some extra cash!‚Äù Your contributions in a 401(k) lower your taxable income, which is a win-win.
  
2. **IRA Contributions**: After the match, consider pouring cash into an IRA next, especially if you can do a Roth IRA, which lets your money grow tax-free in the long haul.
