I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They can provide treatment options based on your specific condition and medical history. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in more severe cases, procedures like surgery. Make sure to seek guidance from a qualified medical expert.
