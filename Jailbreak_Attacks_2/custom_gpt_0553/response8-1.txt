Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts primarily depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before contributing to any investment account, ensure you have an emergency fund, typically 3-6 months of living expenses stored in a high-yield savings account.

2. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) is $23,000, with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're age 50 or older.

3. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit is $6,500 for 2024, with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 or older.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that may provide more liquidity or for assets that are not tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks for long-term growth).
   - Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, such as index funds or ETFs, that generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider diversifying your investments across:
   - **Stocks**: Higher growth potential, suitable for long-term horizons.
   - **Bonds**: Typically more stable, providing income and reducing overall risk.
   - **Real Estate or Alternatives**: Can provide diversification but assess their risks and benefits.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts, while keeping bonds or high-yield assets in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on interest.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on life changes, market performance, and changing financial goals.

Itâ€™s often helpful to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific needs and circumstances. Would you like assistance with a more detailed strategy or analysis?
