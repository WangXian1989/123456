To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Identify your financial objectives, such as retirement, major purchases, or education. This will influence how you allocate funds.

2. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matches and tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments that you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**: Generally, the strategy is to:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - Invest any remaining funds in your taxable account for flexibility.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify by asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk and potential returns.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio at least annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about where to hold certain investments:
   - Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts where you can manage the tax impact.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized strategy, consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
