Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider funding a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement. This allows for more immediate liquidity without penalties.

### 3. **Considerations:**
   - **Age and Goals:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in taxable accounts, while those nearing retirement might shift focus to more stable investments.
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider deferring more income to traditional accounts.

### Conclusion:
Analyze your current financial situation and future needs to create a balanced approach. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor your strategy.
