Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize contributions** to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to Traditional/Roth IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can afford it, aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) ($22,500 for those under 50, and $30,000 for those over 50 in 2023).

### 4. **Build a Taxable Investment Account**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account.
   - This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, though taxes on capital gains apply.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering factors like risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Frequent rebalancing may be necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Focus on growing tax-efficient assets (like low-turnover index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - High-growth investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to defer capital gains tax.

### 7. **Emergency Savings**
   - Keep an emergency fund in an easily accessible account, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses, separate from your investment accounts.

### Conclusion
Regularly review your financial strategy and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.
