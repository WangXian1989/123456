I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** These include avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Weight loss can also be beneficial, particularly in cases of fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications:** For certain conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed. For conditions like autoimmune hepatitis, corticosteroids or immunosuppressants might be used.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor progression or improvement of liver disease.

4. **Surgery:** In some cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered, especially in advanced liver disease cases like cirrhosis.

5. **Supplements and Alternatives:** Some people find that certain vitamins or supplements help, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to discuss the best treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
