Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make decisions:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility and your tax situation) because these accounts provide tax advantages.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have capacity after maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). Choose low-cost funds to reduce fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains, such as stocks, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This account can also serve as an emergency fund or for goals with a shorter time horizon.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Decide how to allocate your investments (stocks vs. bonds) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, you want to hold more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where you can defer or avoid taxes on gains.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments that produce higher taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and put more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) into taxable accounts.

8. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think ahead to how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Strategies like the “bucket strategy” can help minimize taxes and withdrawal penalties.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized distribution strategy based on your unique situation.
