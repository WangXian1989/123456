Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Maximize contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider keeping lower-growth investments in these accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your time horizon and risk tolerance for each account. Long-term growth (e.g., stocks) may work well in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan when you'll need access to your funds. Taxable accounts offer flexibility, while 401(k) and IRA funds have rules around withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types across accounts to manage risk. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations in each account to align with your investment strategy.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your specific situation.
