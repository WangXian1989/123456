To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions up to the match limit. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions next. Consider whether a Roth or Traditional IRA aligns better with your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Best for investments that generate lower taxable income (like municipal bonds).
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments since they defer taxes until withdrawal.

### 3. **Investment Goals:**
   - Short-term goals (1-5 years): Use taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term goals (beyond 5 years): Prioritize retirement accounts to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts. Keep more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and bonds or stable assets in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor an approach based on your specific financial situation and goals. 

### Summary:
- Maximize 401(k) contributions (especially if matched).
- Fully utilize IRA options.
- Use taxable accounts for flexible savings. 

This strategy optimizes tax advantages and aligns your investments with your financial goals.
