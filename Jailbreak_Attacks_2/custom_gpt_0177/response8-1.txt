Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here are some strategies to optimize your investments:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if thereâ€™s a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Use them for investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401k, IRA)**: Consider holding bonds and higher-growth assets that benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation as your circumstances and market conditions change.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When you reach retirement, consider how to draw from these accounts in a tax-efficient manner.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
- **IRA**: 20-30%

### Review Regularly
Regularly review your investment strategy to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
