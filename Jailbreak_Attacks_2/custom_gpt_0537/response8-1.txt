The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. IRAs often have more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've contributed to an IRA, focus on increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals that are shorter-term or for funds that you may need access to before retirement. They can provide more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy. Generally, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) should go in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA), while tax-efficient investments (like stocks) are better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Think about how withdrawals will affect your tax situation in retirement. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.
