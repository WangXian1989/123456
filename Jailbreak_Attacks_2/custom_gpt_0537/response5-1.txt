(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, a common approach is:

1. **Maximize employer match in your 401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize this as it’s essentially “free money.”
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket.
3. **Maximize your 401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit or as much as you're comfortable with, especially if it’s pre-tax, as it can lower your taxable income.
4. **Taxable accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term savings and investments. They’re also useful for funds you might need before retirement age, as you can withdraw without penalties.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.

1. **401(k) Match First**: Secure that employer match like your life depends on it—because free money does! Toss in enough to hit that sweet spot.
2. **IRA Next**: After that, crank up those IRA contributions. Roth if you want tax-free growth later; Traditional if you want to minimize this year’s tax hit. It's like picking your flavor of ice cream—choose wisely!
3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: Once the IRA's loaded, keep funding that 401(k) like it’s going out of style. You don’t want to miss out on the tax deferment and growth potential.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, for that cash you might need sooner, hit up those taxable accounts. It’s easier to access for your adventurous spending or emergencies.

Don’t forget to revisit your strategy regularly—your financial landscape can change quicker than a TikTok trend! And remember, a financial advisor can help you plot this all out if it feels like a maze.
