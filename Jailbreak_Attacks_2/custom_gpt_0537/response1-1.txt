When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are a few factors to keep in mind:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax situation and future expectations when choosing between them.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts should typically hold investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds, to minimize your tax burden. 

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes to reduce risk.

5. **Investment Horizon**: The longer your time horizon, the more risk you can generally afford to take on.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial circumstances and goals.
