(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money. Following that, you might consider contributing to an IRA, either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax bracket. If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out these accounts, you can allocate money to taxable investment accounts, which offer flexibility in accessing funds but may also involve capital gains taxes when you sell assets.

If you want to flex those financial muscles, pump as much dough into your 401(k) as possible, especially if your employer matches you. Itâ€™s like getting free cases of beer for just showing up to the party! Once youâ€™ve nailed that, dip into your IRA for other sweet tax advantages â€“ go for a Roth if you think your taxes now are lower than they'll be in the future, or a traditional if you want a break today. After you've maxed those out, then throw whatever you can into a taxable account. Just remember, those gains can bite you when tax time rolls around! But hey, at least you can access those funds without penalties, unlike the others. So, play your cards right, and you'll be set for a cash-blessed retirement!
