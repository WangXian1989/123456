Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax implications, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach you can take:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these accounts do not have the same tax advantages, they offer flexibility regarding withdrawals and no penalties for early access.

3. **Determine Contributions Based on Goals**:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth due to tax benefits.
   - **Short-term Needs**: If you have goals within the next few years, consider funding a taxable account, as it allows easier access to your funds.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, considering the different tax treatments.
   - For tax-efficient investing, consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation as your needs and market conditions change. This ensures you stay aligned with your long-term financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

Remember, the optimal distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it’s essential to tailor this framework to your particular needs and consult a professional if necessary.
