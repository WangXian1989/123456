To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you are age 50 or older). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments that may yield higher returns, while keeping more liquid or shorter-term investments in taxable accounts. This can help manage short-term capital gains tax.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds) to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think ahead about how and when you'll withdraw funds, especially from tax-advantaged accounts, to minimize tax impact during retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your situation, consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the right strategy will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
