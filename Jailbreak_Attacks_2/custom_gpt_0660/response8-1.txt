The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several individual factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it’s usually a good idea to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA can provide tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide you with tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) for investments that generate a lot of taxable income, such as bonds or high-dividend stocks.
   - Keep investments that produce capital gains or qualified dividends in taxable accounts, as these are generally taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diversify Your Tax Strategies**: Depending on your current tax situation and expected future tax rates, it may be beneficial to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k) and Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts. This can provide flexibility in retirement for managing tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, think about how you plan to withdraw funds from these accounts. Having funds in all three types can give you more flexibility in managing your tax bracket in retirement.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Your investment needs and tax laws can change over time, so it’s important to review your allocations periodically and make adjustments as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help you craft a distribution plan that meets your needs and goals.

It’s crucial to assess your unique situation when determining how to allocate funds among these accounts, and the above steps can serve as a general framework for making informed decisions.
