I'm not a doctor, but it's important to discuss treatment options for liver problems with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice. Generally, treatment for liver issues can vary based on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, and in some cases, procedures like a liver transplant. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
