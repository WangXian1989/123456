Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax bracket, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. It's beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions; contributions to Roth IRAs are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Generally less tax-advantaged, but you have more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

3. **Create an Investment Strategy**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors may opt for more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer conservative options.
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Understand how withdrawals from each type of account will be taxed. Generally, withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.

5. **Regularly Review**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
