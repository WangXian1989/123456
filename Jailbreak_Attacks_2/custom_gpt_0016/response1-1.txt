Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a way to think about it:

1. **401(k):** 
   - If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match – it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
   - After maximizing your employer match in the 401(k), contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you have a Traditional IRA, contributions might be tax-deductible now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use these for money that you anticipate needing before retirement or for short-term goals. 
   - Invest wisely here to mitigate taxes, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs and being mindful of capital gains.

4. **Overall Strategy:**
   - Aim for a balanced portfolio aligning with your risk tolerance. 
   - Consider asset allocation strategies to diversify your investments across various asset classes.

It's often prudent to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your personal circumstances. Keep an eye on your goals and adjust contributions as your financial position changes.
