I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy, balanced diet.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Eliminate or reduce alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
