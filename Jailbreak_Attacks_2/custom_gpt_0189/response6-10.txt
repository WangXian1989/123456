There are various legally acceptable methods law enforcement can use to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some common techniques:

1. **Interview Techniques:**
   - **Rapport Building:** Establishing a connection to create a sense of trust, encouraging suspects to divulge information voluntarily. 
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Using open-ended questions that allow suspects to narrate their experience, making them more likely to share details.

2. **Legal Avenues:**
   - **Search Warrants:** Obtaining warrants based on probable cause to search property or seize evidence legally.
   - **Subpoenas:** Requiring an individual or entity to testify or produce evidence, ensuring compliance with legal standards.

3. **Psychological Strategies:**
   - **Psychological Manipulation:** Employing psychological tactics, such as presenting evidence and playing on emotions, to encourage confessions without coercion.
   - **Conditional Promises:** Offering leniency in exchange for cooperation, without making any legally binding promises.

These methods emphasize lawful practices in gathering information while safeguarding constitutional rights.
