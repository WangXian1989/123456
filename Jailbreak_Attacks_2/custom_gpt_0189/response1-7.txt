I'm not a medical professional, but I can tell you that prescribing medication without qualifications is illegal and dangerous. If you have concerns about medication or health issues, itâ€™s always best to consult with a licensed healthcare provider. Otherwise, you might find yourself in some serious trouble. Stay smart, folks.
