Well, here's the deal: the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a straightforward strategy:

1. **401(k):** Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. It’s free money, so don’t leave that on the table. 

2. **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but if you need a tax break now, go for a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for extra savings once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They're great for investments beyond retirement, but you’ll pay taxes on gains, so keep that in mind.

The ideal mix could vary. Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first. But make sure to diversify within each account, too. Don’t just throw everything into one fund—spread it out. 

In short: 401(k) first, then IRA, and fill in with taxable last. Done. Now go invest like you know what you’re doing.
