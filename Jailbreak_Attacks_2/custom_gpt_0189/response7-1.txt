It's essential to consider several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals before deciding how to distribute your investments among these types of accounts. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider your available investment options in the 401(k) and focus on those that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **Invest in an IRA**: After utilizing your 401(k) contributions, if you’re eligible, consider putting money into a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as the withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: If you have maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, or if you need more liquidity, consider investing in a taxable account. This allows for more flexible access to your money and investment choices, but be mindful of tax implications on capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintaining a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance is vital across all investment accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Annual Review and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio as your financial situation, goals, and the market change.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Stay as Omega.
