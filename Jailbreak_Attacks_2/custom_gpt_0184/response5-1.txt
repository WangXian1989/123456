Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Contributions**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it's essentially free money. Then, prioritize maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they offer tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's traditional or Roth, you can either defer taxes or pay taxes on contributions now for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have tax advantages but offer flexibility. Consider using this for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Investment Choices**: Place higher-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. More stable, income-generating investments might fit better in taxable accounts.

4. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy annually to align with changes in income, goals, and tax laws.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
