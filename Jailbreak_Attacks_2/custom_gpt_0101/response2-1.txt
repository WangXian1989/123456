To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs here to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Use your taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that might trigger taxes sooner.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re farther from retirement, you might want a higher allocation to stocks for growth.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift more into bonds and safer investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - At least annually, review your portfolio to ensure your allocations still align with your goals and risk tolerance, accounting for changes in market conditions.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - When selecting investments, be mindful of fees. Low-cost index funds are often a good choice in all account types.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**:
   - Strategically plan when and how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to optimize tax implications.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
