Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments here to maximize tax deferral benefits.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities**: Favor growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for compounding.
   - **Bonds**: Consider holding in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified interest.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA**.
- **Use taxable accounts for flexibility and specific investment strategies**.

Always adjust based on personal financial situations and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
