Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is often free money.
- **IRA:** Max out your contributions if you can, focusing on a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement. This includes short-term savings or investments in more liquid assets.

### 3. Considerations for Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the equity vs. bond ratio based on your comfort with market fluctuations.
- **Investment Time Horizon:** Longer time frames allow for more aggressive investments.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
- Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for cash or bonds.

### 5. Regular Reassessment
- Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on life changes, market conditions, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Breakdown
- **401(k):** 10-15% of income to max out company match.
- **IRA:** Fully funded up to the limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Use remaining funds after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
The best approach is personalized. Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific situation.
