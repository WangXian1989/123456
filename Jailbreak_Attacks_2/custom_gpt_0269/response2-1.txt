Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free" money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Use these accounts for higher-growth investments, as they can defer taxes on growth.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Stocks in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-risk investments here for tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts:** Bonds generate interest which can be taxed. Keeping them in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan where funds will come from during retirement. Balancing withdrawals can minimize taxes.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalance:**
   - Annually review your investments and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k):** Maximize contributions to take advantage of the employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum and choose investments based on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use excess savings to invest, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution varies by individual circumstances. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs and goals.
