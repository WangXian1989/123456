When determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding an IRA (Roth or Traditional). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

### 2. Understand Tax Implications
   - **401(k)** and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.  
   - **Roth IRAs** allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax upon selling investments. Tax-efficient investing can help minimize taxes.

### 3. Asset Allocation
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, stocks are allocated in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential and tax efficiency.
   - Bonds might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts where interest income isn’t taxed until withdrawal.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalance
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.
   - Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired allocation.

### 5. Seek Professional Advice
   - Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation and retirement goals.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary until you reach the match limit.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions annually, which is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any surplus funds, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
This distribution strategy can help you maximize tax benefits and grow your investments over time. Keep your long-term goals in mind and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes.
