To optimize your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially “free money.” Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth), since these accounts grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (traditional).

### 2. **Taxable Accounts Management**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable gains.
   - **Hold Investments Long-Term:** In taxable accounts, prioritize holding investments longer than a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Consider Risk Tolerance:** Allocate assets according to your risk tolerance across all accounts. Stocks may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to potential growth.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement**
   - **Sequence of Withdrawal:** Plan which accounts to withdraw from first during retirement to minimize taxes and maximize longevity of your investments.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while managing investments in taxable accounts strategically, you can create a well-rounded investment strategy that minimizes taxes and maximizes growth potential. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.
