Choosing the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k) to ensure they align with your investment strategy.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Treatment:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Make sure to adhere to the annual contribution limits.
   - **Investment Flexibility:** IRAs often provide a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Accessibility:** Money in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time without penalties, making them ideal for short-term savings.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes:** Be aware of how your investments will be taxed when sold; preferential rates apply to long-term capital gains.
   - **Diversification:** Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-advantageous (like bonds) or for investments that you may want to access sooner.

### Recommendations:
- **Focus on 401(k) Contributions Initially:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match.
- **Consider Tax Implications:** Balance between traditional and Roth IRAs based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
- **Diversify Across Accounts:** Have a mix of investments in each account type to benefit from both tax-advantaged growth and liquidity in taxable accounts.
- **Review Annually:** Regularly assess and adjust your contributions and investments based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation or goals.
