Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a common strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, especially if you’re eligible for tax deductions or expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after maxing out the IRA if you have remaining financial capacity.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maxed the tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Invest in a diversified portfolio suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon, considering growth-oriented assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with tax efficiency, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution based on changes in income, tax law, and financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
