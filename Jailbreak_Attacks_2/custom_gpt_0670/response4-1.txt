Distributing your money among retirement accounts such as a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations and strategies to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify for tax deductions. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.
   
2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a readily accessible account.

3. **Tax Implications**: 
   - Understand the tax implications of each account. For example, withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) and IRA in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts have different capital gains tax implications.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. If you plan to buy a house in the near future, you might want to keep money in a taxable account for easier access.
   - If you're investing for the long term (e.g., retirement in 20+ years), you might want the bulk of your investments in tax-advantaged accounts that allow for compound growth.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments within each account type. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your planned withdrawal strategy in retirement when distributing your investments. You may want to keep certain assets in taxable accounts for flexibility.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual financial situations, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals while optimizing tax efficiency.
