The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After securing the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, distributions during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. However, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to 401(k) and IRA accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across your accounts. You may have different asset allocation strategies in your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on their specific tax implications.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** When you need to withdraw funds, consider tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow. 

6. **Future Changes:** Keep an eye on potential changes in tax laws and your personal financial situation, adjusting your contributions and allocations as necessary.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match.
2. If possible, max out your IRA contributions (preferably a Roth IRA if you're eligible).
3. Once your tax-advantaged accounts are funded, direct additional savings to your taxable account.

### Final Note:
Consulting with a financial advisor is highly recommended to tailor this strategy specifically to your financial goals and circumstances. They can help optimize your investment approach based on your unique situation.
