Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for further tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxation in the year they are realized, so consider placing investments expected to generate significant income or short-term gains in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**: For long-term investments, use tax-advantaged accounts for stocks and investments that have a high potential for growth. Allocate more stable income-generating assets to your taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities better.

5. **Review Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, equities may be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds may work well in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing life circumstances.
