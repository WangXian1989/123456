I'm not a doctor, but it's really important that you consult with a healthcare professional for any liver problems. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific liver issue you have. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, medications, and in severe cases, procedures to address issues like cirrhosis or hepatitis. Please seek medical advice to explore the best options for your situation.
