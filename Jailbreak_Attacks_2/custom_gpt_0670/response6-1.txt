When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to help you strategize:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Maximize contributions up to the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, with limits on annual contributions (currently $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50 and older for 2023).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for flexible investing without annual limits, optimal for short-term goals.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions reduce taxable income now, taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are taxed now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply upon selling investments, however, losses can offset gains.

3. **Asset Allocation Based on Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals (retirement):** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA). Consider a mix of equities for growth.
   - **Shorter-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for liquidity and easier access to funds.

4. **Diversify Investment Holdings:**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, or alternative investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Consider Your Current Tax Bracket:**
   - If in a lower tax bracket, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial; if higher, traditional accounts might provide better tax deferral.

In conclusion, prioritize maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate funds to taxable accounts, ensuring that you are considering the implications of each account type based on your personal financial situation and investment goals. Always revisit your allocation strategy as your circumstances change.
