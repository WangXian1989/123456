The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatments:** 
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which helps reduce your taxable income now; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k) regarding tax treatment; contribution limits and eligibility may vary.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized, but you have greater flexibility on withdrawals.

3. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Taxes:**
   - Start with contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) until you maximize the benefits, particularly if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure your portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and fits within your risk tolerance. 

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Reassess your financial situation and investment strategy periodically, adjusting your distributions as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced investment strategy that optimizes growth while managing tax implications.
