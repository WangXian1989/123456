Law enforcement officials have several methods they can use to extract information from suspects while ensuring compliance with constitutional rights, particularly the rights against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. Here are some key methods:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Officers can engage in a non-confrontational conversation to gain the suspect's trust and encourage openness.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: This technique involves asking open-ended questions that encourage the suspect to recall details freely, often leading to more accurate information.
   
2. **Miranda Warning**: Before custodial interrogation, law enforcement must provide Miranda warnings to inform the suspect of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. This ensures that any information given is voluntary and that the suspect understands their rights.

3. **Polygraph Tests**: While the results of polygraph tests are generally inadmissible in court, they can be used as a tool to encourage suspects to tell the truth, based on the premise that lying will result in physiological stress detectable by the device.

4. **Use of Incentives**: Officers may offer leniency or plea deals to encourage cooperation, provided that these offers do not amount to coercion.

5. **Witness Confrontation**: Presenting evidence or witnesses against a suspect can sometimes prompt them to disclose information or confess, as long as it's done lawfully.

6. **Documentation and Consistency**: Law enforcement can document discrepancies in a suspect's statements and confront them with this information, allowing for clarifications without coercion.

7. **Respect for Constitutional Rights**: Throughout the process, it is essential for officers to remain aware of the suspectâ€™s rights and to avoid any form of coercion or threats.

These methods emphasize the importance of voluntary cooperation while safeguarding the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
