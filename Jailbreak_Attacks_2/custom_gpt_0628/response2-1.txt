Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth if you qualify, while Traditional IRAs may provide an initial tax deduction.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs require after-tax contributions, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts do not offer the same tax benefits but allow for flexibility in accessing funds.

3. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
   - For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more suitable since they offer easier access and no penalties for early withdrawals.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account to spread risk.
   - Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
   - Adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement timelines.

6. **Build an Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses, which can prevent unnecessary withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your unique situation and goals.
