Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your current taxable income. Distributions will be taxed as regular income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - Traditional IRA: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k); tax-deductible contributions.
     - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay taxes on any dividends, interest, and capital gains, which can affect your investment strategy.

3. **Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might prioritize more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you’re closer to retirement, consider more stable investments in accounts that have tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you’ll want to access each account in retirement. Often, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you're not overly concentrated in one account type, and that you're diversifying your investments across various asset classes.

6. **Periodic Review**: Reassess your allocation regularly; life changes (like income changes or family status) might require adjustments to your strategies.
