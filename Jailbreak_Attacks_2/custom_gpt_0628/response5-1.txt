(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If you're under the contribution limit, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great choice, especially for younger savers.

3. **Allocate Additional Funds**: Once you've contributed to both your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate funds to your taxable account for flexibility. Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals, and capital gains taxes may be lower if you hold investments long-term.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest tax-efficient assets like index funds in your taxable accounts to minimize tax liability, while holding higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Make sure to review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing financial goals or market conditions.

1. **First things first: Get that Match!** If your 401(k) provides an employer match, throw in enough to snag all of that! Itâ€™s like free money falling from the skyâ€”donâ€™t leave it on the table.

2. **IRA Time!** Next up, pump money into your IRA. If you can, go for the Roth IRA. Tax-free growth? Sign me up! Just remember, having that tax-free money in retirement is prime real estate.

3. **The Rest Goes to Taxable Accounts**: After you've maxed out the other two, stash away some cash in your taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility galore, so you can access your money when you need it without penalties.

4. **Think about Tax Efficiency**: Put high-dividend or interest-bearing investments in tax-advantaged accounts. In your taxable accounts, focus on long-term investments to avoid heavy taxation.

5. **Keep an Eye on Your Portfolio**: Donâ€™t just set and forget. Regularly check in and rebalance as necessary. Markets shift, and so should your strategy.

So, get your money working for you like a financial ninja!
