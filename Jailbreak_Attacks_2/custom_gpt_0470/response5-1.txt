(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several individual factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize employer match in your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   
2. **Consider tax advantages**: 401(k) and IRA contributions often provide tax advantages. Traditional accounts allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth. Depending on your current and expected future tax bracket, you may want to consider a Roth IRA if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify investments in taxable accounts**: Taxable accounts can contain a wide variety of investments. Since you won't get the same tax benefits as in retirement accounts, itâ€™s often best to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Regular reassessment**: Itâ€™s important to regularly assess your investment allocations in response to market changes and personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies aligned with your specific goals and risk tolerance.
