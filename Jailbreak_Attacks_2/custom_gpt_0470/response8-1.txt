When it comes to distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your specific financial situation, goals, and investment strategy. Here are some key principles to guide your allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money. After that, consider trying to maximize your contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - **IRA**: If you have enough income to contribute, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation). A Roth IRA can be more beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or when you wish to have more access to your funds. Consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

3. **Balance Risk and Return**:
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where growth will not be taxed until withdrawal.

4. **Time Horizon**:
   - Consider your investment timeline. Money that you won't need for many years can often be allocated more aggressively in growth-oriented investments.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they are aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Make adjustments as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal financial situations can differ significantly. A professional can tailor advice to better suit your individual needs.

In summary, prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, understand the nuances of taxable accounts, and align your allocation with your financial goals and risk profile.
