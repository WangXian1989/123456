Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions if possible, especially if you have high income and want to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider traditional IRAs for tax-deferred growth or Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
