To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. Ideal for higher-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you may need before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Investment Options**:
   - Diversify within each account. Use tax-advantaged accounts for bonds and high-growth assets that appreciate significantly over time.
   - Keep less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and consider using low-cost index funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Pay Attention to Contribution Limits**: Ensure you're aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and adjust your strategy accordingly.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly reevaluate your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and retirement goals.
