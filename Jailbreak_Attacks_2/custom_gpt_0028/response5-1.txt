(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer matches contributions. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for potential tax advantages. Finally, use any additional funds for taxable accounts, which offer flexibility but may incur taxes on capital gains and dividends. It's also wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
