Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, max out your traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs grow tax-free.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. 

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth with diversified investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and account for market changes.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice, considering your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach helps optimize tax benefits and align with your retirement strategy.
