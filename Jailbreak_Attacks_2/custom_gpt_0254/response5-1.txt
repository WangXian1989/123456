To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize annual contributions; consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments with lower capital gains, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Utilize for higher-yield, tax-inefficient investments (like bonds), as they grow tax-deferred.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Balance risk and return across all accounts. Ensure diversification and alignment with your overall investment strategy.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications; taxable accounts may be best tapped first to minimize tax liability.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adapt as your financial situation changes, ensuring your distribution strategy remains aligned with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance is also recommended.
