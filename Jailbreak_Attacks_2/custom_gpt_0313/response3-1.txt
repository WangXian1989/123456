Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are tax-free on withdrawals (after retirement age), while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investment. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

### 4. **Balance Asset Locations**
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on those gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable or income-generating assets (like bonds) to benefit from lower capital gains taxes over time.

### 5. **Consider Individual Circumstances**
   - **Age and Goals**: Younger investors may lean towards growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those near retirement might prioritize withdrawals and tax-efficiency.
   - **Tax Brackets**: Evaluate your current and anticipated future tax rates.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy, especially as your financial situation changes.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice considering your specific circumstances.

### Conclusion
By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and considering the types of investments held in each, you can optimize your overall return while minimizing tax liabilities.
