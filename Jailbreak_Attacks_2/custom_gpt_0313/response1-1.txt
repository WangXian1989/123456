Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to max out your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you have access to low-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or interest. Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies, like holding stocks long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain sufficient cash in an emergency fund separate from these accounts.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Horizon**: Younger investors might focus more on growth (stocks), while those nearing retirement may want to shift to more stable investments (bonds).
- **Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates when deciding where to allocate funds.
- **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes.

Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation is also a wise step.
