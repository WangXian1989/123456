Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, liquidity needs, and investment goals. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize 401(k) or IRA Contributions**:
   - Focus on funding your 401(k) and IRA until you reach the maximum contribution limits. For 2024, those limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up if youâ€™re over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need access to before retirement, or as a place to invest in assets that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without being taxed until withdrawal. Place more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may generate less taxable income.

6. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Review your distribution strategy regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and your financial goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Understand that withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as income, whereas qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.
