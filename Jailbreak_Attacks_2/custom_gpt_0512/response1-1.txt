To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred contributions; often has employer matching. Good for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA:** Also tax-deferred until withdrawal (Traditional) or tax-free if qualified withdrawals (Roth). Offers similar benefits as a 401(k) but with lower contribution limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term savings or investments.

2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you're eligible.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for growth-oriented investments.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding bonds or assets expected to appreciate in a way that minimizes tax impact.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to spread risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your asset allocation at least annually and adjust as needed.

7. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals. Would you like to dive deeper into any of these aspects?
