I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a balanced diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), prescribed medications may help.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Herbal Remedies**: Some people use milk thistle or other supplements, but consult your doctor first.

Always talk to a healthcare provider for a personalized plan.
