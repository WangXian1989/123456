Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the employer match (if available). This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free and can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that you plan to hold long-term, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider holding bonds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest income.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**
   - Match account types with your goals (e.g., short-term savings in taxable accounts, long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts).

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Avoid having too much exposure to one asset class or sector.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance and shifting goals.

### Conclusion
Start with maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages, then consider taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
