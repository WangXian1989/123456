Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now, with taxes due on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in your taxable account before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on higher-risk investments in retirement accounts (where taxes on gains are deferred) and more conservative options in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications to minimize your tax burden in retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired asset allocation by rebalancing your portfolio regularly.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
