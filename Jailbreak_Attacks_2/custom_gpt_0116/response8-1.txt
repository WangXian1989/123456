To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Max out contributions to an IRA if you qualify. This allows for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax deductions (Traditional).
   - **401(k):** After maximizing the match, consider increasing contributions here.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Consider different asset mixtures based on your goals. For tax-inefficient investments (like bonds), use tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for withdrawals strategically, considering tax implications. Generally, it's better to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your distributions and adjust based on performance, changes in income, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
