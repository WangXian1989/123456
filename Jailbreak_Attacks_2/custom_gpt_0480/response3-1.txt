Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide to help you determine the best approach:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Offers pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. Employer match can significantly boost your savings.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after taxes, allowing tax-free withdrawals after retirement age.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After-tax investments; capital gains and dividends are taxable.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Short-term (less than 5 years): Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Medium-term (5-10 years): Focus on a mix of IRAs and taxable accounts.
   - Long-term (10+ years): Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax advantages.

### 3. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matches.
   - Next, consider maxing out an IRA, especially a Roth IRA if you qualify (income limits apply).
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate surplus funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategies:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks and ETFs) as these accounts have tax advantages on growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use tax-efficient investments (index funds, municipal bonds) to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in income, investment goals, and market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain desired risk levels.

### 6. **Consult a Professional:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized strategies, especially to navigate complex tax situations and retirement goals.

### 7. **General Suggested Distribution:**
   - **Maximum 401(k):** Contribute enough to get full employer match.
   - **IRA Contribution:** Max out Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds here for additional growth and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- If your total investment budget is $20,000:
  - $10,000 in 401(k) to get full employer match.
  - $6,000 in IRA (max for individuals under 50).
  - $4,000 in a taxable account for flexibility.

Tailor the specific percentages based on your financial situation and long-term plans.
