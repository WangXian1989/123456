Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Max out your contributions if you qualify (especially Roth IRA for tax-free growth).
  
### 2. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of equity and bond funds. Target higher growth assets if you're younger.
   - **IRA**: Similar allocation as your 401(k) but consider including tax-efficient investments like index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, tax-managed funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA are taxed as ordinary income. Taxable account gains can be taxed at lower rates, depending on holding period.
   - Balance between capital gains and dividend taxes in your taxable account to manage tax liabilities.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Keep your investment mix aligned with your goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance at least annually.

### 5. **Emergency Funds**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid premature withdrawals.

## Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable**: 20%

This distribution can vary depending on your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
