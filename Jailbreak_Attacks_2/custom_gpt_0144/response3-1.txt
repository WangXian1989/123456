To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Invest in a diversified mix of funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. It allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate capital gains, such as stocks or ETFs, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. You can also utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where they can grow tax-free (401(k) or IRA) and keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocation based on market performance and your changing risk tolerance.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring these strategies to your unique situation can yield better outcomes.
