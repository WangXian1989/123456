It’s essential to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a match for the 401(k). This is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you are eligible. This can provide tax-deferred growth.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For instance, IRS limits can change yearly, so check the current limits.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each account. Taxable accounts may be more beneficial for short-term goals due to their flexibility, whereas retirement accounts may incur penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Each account may have different investment options. Tailor your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: 
   - Regularly review your allocations. As market conditions change or as you approach retirement, you may need to adjust your distribution.

6. **Consider Future Withdrawals**: 
   - Plan for when you might need to access your funds. Taxable accounts are more liquid and can be used for short-term needs without penalties, unlike 401(k)s and IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you’re unsure about the best strategy, it might be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Diversifying your assets while understanding the implications of each account type is key to effective money distribution.

If you’re investing for the long term and have a clear understanding of when you might need the money, this will greatly influence how you allocate funds across these accounts.
