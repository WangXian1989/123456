Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial for tax deferral.

2. **Allocate Based on Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA since these accounts benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep money in your taxable accounts for liquidity. This might include conservative investments or cash equivalents.

3. **Tax Efficiency Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place higher-turnover investments in your 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax deferral on capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to maintain a risk level suitable for your situation. Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors.

5. **Regularly Reevaluate**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on market conditions, changes in financial goals, or tax law changes.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and align your investment strategy with your financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
