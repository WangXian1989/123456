The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs often offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on the gains until withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts donâ€™t have tax benefits but allow for more flexible access to your money without penalties.

3. **Emergency Savings**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider placing higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since they have the potential for higher returns and you defer taxes on gains.
   - Reserve more stable, dividend-paying investments (like bonds and dividend stocks) in taxable accounts, as you can benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Decide how soon you'll need the funds. For long-term goals, prioritize retirement accounts. For short-term needs, a taxable account may be more appropriate.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocation as needed based on your changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Ultimately, it's about finding the right balance that works for your financial situation while aiming for growth and minimizing taxes over time.
