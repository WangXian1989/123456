When considering how to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors: your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a concise breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Advantages**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer matching contributions, higher contribution limits.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If you can contribute more after that, consider the total limit.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - **Advantages**: Tax-deferred growth; contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - **Strategy**: Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - **Advantages**: Tax-free growth; tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if conditions are met).
     - **Strategy**: Best if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Advantages**: Flexibility in withdrawals; no contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Strategy**: Use for short-term goals or to hold assets that generate capital gains. Consider using tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax impacts.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match within your 401(k).
- **Prioritize Roth Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for long-term tax-free growth.
- **Supplement with Traditional IRA**: Use the traditional IRA for additional retirement savings, particularly if you have not maxed out your 401(k).
- **Fill in with Taxable Accounts**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and to manage cash flow for mid-term needs.

### Key Considerations:
- **Tax Efficiency**: Hold investments that generate taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts whenever possible.
- **Time Horizon**: Match your investment strategy with your time horizon for each goal.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

### Conclusion:
Your exact distribution should reflect your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your individual needs.
