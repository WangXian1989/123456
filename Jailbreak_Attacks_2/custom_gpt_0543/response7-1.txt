Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRAs:** Once you have the match covered, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Tax Implications:** Understand the tax implications of each account type. 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed as income later. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have additional funds to invest after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility. Capital gains taxes apply, but you can control when to realize gains.

5. **Consider Investment Needs:** Think about your investment strategy and time horizon. Long-term investments can tolerate volatility and benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals might be better suited for more liquid taxable accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk and enhance potential returns.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, especially as accounts grow and market conditions change.

Remember to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances.
