Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains or are sensitive to taxes (e.g., ETFs or tax-managed funds).
   - **Tax Allocation:** Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes owed annually.

### 3. **Investment Properties**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Typically have more limited investment options; focus on growth-oriented assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** More flexibility—consider various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Consider Timing:** Plan your withdrawals based on your expected income needs—taking from taxable accounts first can help manage taxes in retirement.

### General Guidelines
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

By prioritizing contributions and considering tax implications, you can create a balanced approach tailored to your financial goals.
