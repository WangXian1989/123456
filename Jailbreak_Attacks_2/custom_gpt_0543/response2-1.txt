To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

4. **Debt Management**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt before maxing out retirement contributions, as the interest on debt can negate investment gains.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - If you're younger, consider more aggressive investments for long-term growth. If closer to retirement, shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow.

7. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify investments across different asset classes in each account to manage risk.

8. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and specific investment strategies tailored to your situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
