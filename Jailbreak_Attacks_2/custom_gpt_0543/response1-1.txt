To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Employer matches can provide additional benefits.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold and taxes on dividends and interest income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals. 401(k) and IRA funds are generally better for long-term growth due to penalties for early withdrawal.

3. **Fees and Expenses**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment options and higher fees. Compare this to IRAs which often offer a broader range of investments with more control over fees.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts allow for greater flexibility since you can access your funds without penalties. 401(k)s and IRAs impose restrictions and potential penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your comfort level with risk to determine your asset allocation across these accounts.

### Suggested Approach

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**:
   - If eligible, consider maxing out traditional or Roth IRA contributions based on your tax situation.

3. **Pay Down High-Interest Debt**:
   - Consider paying off any high-interest debt instead of maximizing contributions if applicable.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds or ETFs).

5. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly based on changing financial circumstances and goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
