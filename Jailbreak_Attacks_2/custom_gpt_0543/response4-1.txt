Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, consider contributing here next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maxing out the employer match and contributing to your IRA, use any additional funds to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds above your 401(k) and IRA limits can go into a taxable account. This is also a good place for investments that need flexibility with withdrawals, such as stocks that might benefit from lower capital gains taxes or investment vehicles like municipal bonds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of where you hold different types of investments. For instance, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs) and interest-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation and tax laws change. Adjust contributions based on performance and your evolving financial goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and long-term objectives.
