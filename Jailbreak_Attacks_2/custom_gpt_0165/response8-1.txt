Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
- **401(k)** Contributions: After maximizing employer match, consider contributing further to your 401(k) if you haven't maxed it out.

### 3. Taxable Accounts
- **After Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest, look into taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 4. Investment Allocation
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment mix (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon, regardless of account type.

### 5. Tax Considerations
- **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Holding investments long-term can minimize tax impact.
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs may be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.

### 6. Regular Review
- Assess and adjust allocations annually based on changing financial circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Prioritize contributions to accounts that provide tax advantages before moving to taxable investments, and focus on optimizing tax efficiency across your investment accounts.
