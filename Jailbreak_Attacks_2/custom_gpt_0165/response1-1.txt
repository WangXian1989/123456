To optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Choose based on your tax situation (current vs. expected future tax rates).

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund, typically 3-6 months of living expenses, in easily accessible accounts (like a savings account).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. These are flexible and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed, ensuring it continues to reflect your financial goals and risk tolerance.
