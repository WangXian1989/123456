1. **Interview Techniques**: Utilizing rapport-building strategies to create a non-confrontational environment.

2. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily, ensuring they understand their rights.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Clearly informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have legal counsel before questioning.

4. **Behavioral Analysis**: Observing body language and emotional responses to guide questioning without intimidation.

5. **Witnesses and Evidence**: Presenting evidence and witness statements to prompt suspects to share their side of the story.
