Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Ideal if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also provides tax deductions on contributions, with tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) for long-term growth investments.
   - IRAs can also hold a mix of stocks and bonds but add more risk management as you approach retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can include more liquid, conservative investments as gains are taxed annually.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-deferred accounts to avoid annual tax on interest income.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that yield qualified dividends or capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Adjust Based on Age**:
   - Younger individuals might focus more on growth (stocks).
   - As you approach retirement, shift to more conservative allocations (bonds, cash).

6. **Regular Reviews**: Regularly reassess your portfolio to adjust based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.
