Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both are tax-advantaged accounts. Traditional accounts offer tax-deferred growth; Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current vs. expected future tax rates, you may prefer one over the other:
     - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Use if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth 401(k)/IRA**: Suitable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Max out IRA Contributions**
   - After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation). As of 2024, the annual contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

### 4. **Continue Funding 401(k)**
   - Once you’ve maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limits ($22,500 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2024).

### 5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxable events.

### 6. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to remain aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Additional Considerations
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for unexpected expenses before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across your accounts to mitigate risk.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice may provide additional value based on your specific circumstances.

Overall, the goal is to optimize for growth while considering your tax implications and future financial needs.
