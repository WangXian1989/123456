Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and a great starting point.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. A traditional IRA can also be beneficial if you want tax deductions now.
   - If you’re already maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions (the combined limits for 2023 are $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs), then you can consider allocating funds to taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for funds you might need before retirement or for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or certain stock dividends). The tax treatment is different, so you may want to limit investments in high-turnover or interest-generating assets in these accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Often has limited investment choices, but take advantage of low-cost index funds, especially if you are investing for the long-term.
   - **IRA:** You may have a wider range of investment options. This flexibility can aid in risk diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Typically used for more opportunistic investing or if you need to withdraw funds before retirement.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. Aim for 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Your financial situation and market conditions can change. Review your allocations annually or after significant life events.

### Summary
- Start with maxing out your 401(k) company match.
- Then, maximize contributions to an IRA (Roth if eligible).
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and opportunities.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific needs and situation.
