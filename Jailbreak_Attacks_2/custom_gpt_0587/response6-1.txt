To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Tax Optimization
1. **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) suits your tax situation better.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Strategically**:
   - Invest in assets with lower capital gains rates, like index funds or ETFs, to limit tax implications.
   - Harvest tax losses to offset gains, socially responsible strategies, or short-term trading.

### Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance
1. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all account types.

2. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your risk level and investment strategy.

### Recommendations
- Start with maxing out employer-sponsored plans (like a 401(k)), then contribute to IRAs, and finally allocate funds to taxable accounts.
- Consider your liquidity needs; keep enough in taxable accounts for short-term expenses and emergencies.

This balanced approach helps you leverage tax advantages while still maintaining a diversified investment portfolio.
