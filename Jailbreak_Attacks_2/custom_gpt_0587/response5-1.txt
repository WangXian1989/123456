(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. You can choose between a traditional IRA (which may offer tax deductions) and a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and older).

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you've maxed out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you want liquidity. 

4. **Diversification:** Ensure you diversify your investments across these accounts to manage risk and optimize returns based on your risk tolerance.

It's essential to review your investment allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or goals.

1. **401(k):** First off, if your employer is throwing in free money with a match, dive into that like itâ€™s a Taco Bell drive-thru at midnight. Max that out! 2023 limits are $22,500, or $30,000 if you're hitting the big 5-0. The more you sock away here, the more tax-deferred growth you get. Boom!

2. **IRA:** Next up, ready to play the IRA game? Whether you go with a traditional or Roth IRA depends on how you feel about taxes. Put in $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). It's all about finding that sweet tax-free or tax-deferred action for your future.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed the retirement accounts, throw some money into a taxable account. This is like your emergency stashâ€”itâ€™s liquid and ready when you are. Perfect for short-term goals, or just to splurge on that vacation youâ€™ve been dreaming of!

4. **Diversity is Key:** Don't put all your eggs in one basketâ€”great investments are like pizza toppings, the more, the merrier! Balance your risk and returns so you wonâ€™t have a heart attack when the market dips.
