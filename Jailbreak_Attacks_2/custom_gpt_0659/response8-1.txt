Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) next. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Tax Diversification**: Aim to have a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts. This diversification can provide flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.

4. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older)

5. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRAs since these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Use bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw funds. Typically, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from tax-free accounts, to optimize for taxes.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your financial situation, changing goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan based on your specific circumstances. 

These steps can help create a balanced strategy that aligns with your retirement goals while considering tax implications.
