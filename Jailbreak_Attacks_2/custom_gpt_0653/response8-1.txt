The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to Roth IRA (If Eligible):** If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Prioritize Traditional IRA:** If you're not eligible for a Roth IRA or want to reduce your taxable income now, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. Contributions may be tax-deductible, depending on your income and other factors.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing your contributions to retirement accounts, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility in terms of access to funds without penalties and can be used for various goals (like buying a home, travel, etc.).

5. **Asset Location Strategy:** Think about where to place your investments based on their tax implications. For instance, place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer or avoid taxes on capital gains. Consider placing bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage taxes more efficiently.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Ensure that you periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your goals, market performance, and life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Every financial situation is unique. Taking professional advice can help tailor these guidelines to your specific needs and circumstances.

Always ensure that your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.
