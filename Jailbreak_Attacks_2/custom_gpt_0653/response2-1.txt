The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, as these can be more tax-efficient compared to ordinary income from 401(k)s or IRAs. 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, aim to diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets is advisable.

5. **Stay Within Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type to avoid penalties.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly to ensure they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.

Always consider your long-term financial strategy when deciding how to allocate your funds.
