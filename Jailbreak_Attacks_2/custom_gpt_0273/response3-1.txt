Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional IRA/401(k):** Contributions are generally tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals can be tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are taxed as capital gains; long-term gains (held over a year) are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term (10+ years):** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for growth.
   - **Medium to Short-Term:** Use taxable accounts for more liquidity and flexibility.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Annual Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type to maximize your tax advantages annually.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk/return profile.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match, then contribute 5-10% of your salary.
- **Roth IRA:** Contribute up to the annual limit if eligible.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest remaining funds post-401(k) and IRA contributions.

### Final Considerations
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your personal circumstances.
- Keep an emergency fund in a liquid account separate from these investments.

This approach balances growth potential and tax efficiency while aligning with your financial goals.
