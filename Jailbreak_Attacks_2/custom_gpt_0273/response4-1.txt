To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute up to the maximum allowed, focusing on a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRAs**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals are taxed as regular income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains when sold, so they’re better for shorter-term goals or when you want flexibility.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with higher growth potential (stocks), as they benefit more from tax deferral.
   - Consider holding bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts to reduce immediate tax impacts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

These steps can help you create an effective investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
