I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, balanced meals).
   - Increased physical activity.
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications.

2. **Medications**:
   - Anti-inflammatory drugs.
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests.
   - Ultrasounds or biopsies if necessary.
