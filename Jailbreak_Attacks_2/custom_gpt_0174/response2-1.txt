Finding the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on dividends and capital gains. Use them for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds.

### 3. **Emergency Fund Priority:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, but consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Assess Your Time Horizon:**
   - Longer-term goals can go into retirement accounts, while shorter-term needs might be better suited for taxable accounts.

### 6. **Use a Roth IRA if Possible:**
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 7. **Rebalancing Strategy:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Distribution Plan:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive the full employer match.
2. **IRA**: Maximize contributions if you qualify.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings and investment opportunities.

### Conclusion:
Monitor your investments and adjust your strategy as needed. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
