To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deferral. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider holding long-term investments to benefit from lower tax rates.

3. **Determine Your Retirement Needs**: Assess when you plan to retire and your expected income needs. This can help guide how much to allocate to each account type.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation based on how close you are to retirement. The further away you are, the more you can typically invest in growth assets.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your intended risk level and investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
