Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). Depending on your income, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) to reach the annual limit if you can afford it.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like real estate or high-dividend stocks) or for savings goals that are shorter-term (like buying a home).

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly check your allocations and rebalance to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of taxes on capital gains in taxable accounts and potential penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

It’s often good to consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
