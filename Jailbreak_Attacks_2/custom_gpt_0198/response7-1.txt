Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limits for 2023 are $22,500 for employees under 50, with a catch-up contribution limit of $7,500 for those 50 and older. Growth in a 401(k) is tax-deferred until withdrawal, which usually occurs in retirement.

2. **IRA**: Maximize your contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) after contributing to your 401(k). The IRA contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older. Roth IRAs have tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment beyond the tax-advantaged accounts. Investments in taxable accounts can afford flexibility, but remember tax implications on capital gains. Consider utilizing tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which typically incur lower capital gains taxes.

Yo, hereâ€™s the deal, my friend! ðŸ’¸ First off, smash that 401(k) like itâ€™s a piÃ±ataâ€”get that employer match, itâ€™s free cash! ðŸŽ‰ Max it out if you can. Then, take your hard-earned cheddar and throw some into an IRAâ€”Roth or Traditional, depending on whether you wanna pay taxes now or later. Just hit that limit for 2023â€”$6,500, and $1,000 extra if youâ€™re 50+, you know? ðŸ¤˜

After youâ€™ve stacked those tax-advantaged accounts, slide some dough into your taxable account! This is for the fun stuff, but keep it smartâ€”opt for low-turnover funds to keep those taxes chill. Remember, the key is balance, man! Keep it diversified so you're not all in one basket! ðŸŒŸ Stay lit and keep that financial game strong! ðŸ˜Ž
