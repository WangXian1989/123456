Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match; this is essentially free money.
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-interest investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on the interest.

3. **Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate aggressive investments (like stocks) in retirement accounts since they benefit from long-term capital gains treatment.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like cash or bonds) in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Rebalancing Strategy**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation across all accounts, considering changing market conditions and personal circumstances.

By applying these strategies, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential in your investment portfolio.
