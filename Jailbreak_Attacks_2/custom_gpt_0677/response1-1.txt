When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal, which is great for long-term growth. Be mindful of taxable accounts where you may owe taxes on capital gains and dividends annually.

4. **Diversify Allocations**: Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting allocations based on risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Regular Reviews and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance if certain investments outperform or underperform. This helps maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, a common approach is to withdraw first from taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, followed by traditional IRAs and 401(k)s.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. They can help you devise a plan that makes the most sense for your unique financial situation.
