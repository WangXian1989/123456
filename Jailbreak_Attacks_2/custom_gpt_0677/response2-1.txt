Optimally distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching. This is essentially "free money." 
   - Consider traditional contributions for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth 401(k) if you prefer to pay taxes now for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, assuming you meet income limits. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - Alternatively, use a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, especially if you can deduct contributions.
   - Contribute the maximum allowed to take advantage of tax benefits and compounding growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can help you achieve shorter-term goals and provide easy access to your funds without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains when necessary.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.
   - Tweak your asset allocation to favor stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while holding more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as needed to ensure alignment with your goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
