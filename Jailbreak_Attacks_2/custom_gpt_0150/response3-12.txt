I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adjusting diet (low-fat, high-fiber)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - For specific conditions (like hepatitis or fatty liver)

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, such as liver transplantation

5. **Supportive Therapies**: 
   - Dietary supplements or therapies tailored to specific liver conditions

Consult a doctor for a personalized treatment plan.
