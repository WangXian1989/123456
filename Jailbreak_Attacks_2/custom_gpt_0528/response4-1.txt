To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts** first: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Follow this by maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your situation).
   - **Taxable accounts** should hold investments that generate lower taxable income or capital gains, such as index funds and ETFs.

2. **Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions. Ideal for long-term growth and to defer taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA gives you a tax deduction now, while Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use for more flexible access to funds and investments that might generate capital gains rather than ordinary income. 

3. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement age and goals. If you anticipate needing the funds before the age of 59Â½, keep less in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize early withdrawal penalties.
  
4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts, but consider more aggressive growth investments in tax-deferred accounts and more conservative or income-producing assets in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio, ensuring that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your retirement withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impacts; for instance, consider which accounts to withdraw from first to manage your tax bracket efficiently during retirement.
