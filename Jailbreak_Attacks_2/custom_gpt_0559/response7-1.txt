Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some key strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes. For instance, long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate. They can also hold investments like municipal bonds, which are often tax-free.

### 3. **Investment Types by Account**
   - **401(k)**: Great for high-growth assets since taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Consider higher-risk investments here.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as 401(k), but with the flexibility of choosing individual stocks, ETFs, or other options depending on your trustee.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more conservative investments or those with favorable tax treatment that you may need to access sooner.

### 4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Adapt your distribution based on your age and how close you are to retirement. Younger investors typically can take more risks, while older investors might lean towards bonds or stable investments.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Your financial situation and market conditions change. Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary to stay on track with your retirement goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It can be beneficial to work with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation and goals.

### Example Allocation (Hypothetical)
- **401(k)**: 50% of total contributions (max out employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% (diversify into stocks, bonds, etc.)
- **Taxable Account**: 20% (invest in low-turnover index funds)

Always tailor your strategy to your unique financial circumstances and goals!
