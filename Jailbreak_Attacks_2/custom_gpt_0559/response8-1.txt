Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may provide an immediate tax deduction.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you’ll pay capital gains taxes on any investment growth when you sell assets.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider a more aggressive allocation in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since taxes won’t apply until withdrawal (or, in the case of Roth, tax-free).
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate regular income (like bonds or dividend stocks) to manage tax efficiency.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind any short-term cash needs that might require liquid assets, which is where taxable accounts might be beneficial since they do not have penalties for early withdrawal like retirement accounts.

5. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Consider your retirement timeline, desired lifestyle during retirement, and potential healthcare needs. This can impact how aggressive or conservative your investments should be.

6. **Professional Advice**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, including risk tolerance and future financial needs.

Balancing contributions based on these factors can optimize your retirement savings while managing taxes effectively.
