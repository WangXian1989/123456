Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and expected time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
- **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider maximizing contributions to an IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. Taxable Accounts
- **Use for Flexibility**: Keep additional investments in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. These funds can be accessed without penalty.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Profile**: Adjust your investment mix based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, equities are more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

### Final Considerations
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Professional**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Overall, aim for a mix that leverages tax advantages while maintaining liquidity and growth potential.
