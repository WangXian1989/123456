Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to maximize your tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings. They allow flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short-term goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are best for long-term growth; consider a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. 

This strategy balances maximizing tax advantages and maintaining liquidity for spending needs.
