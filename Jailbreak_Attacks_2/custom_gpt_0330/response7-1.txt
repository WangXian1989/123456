To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k) First:** Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Next:** Max out your IRA if eligible. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last:** Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **401(k):** Consider holding higher-risk assets (like stocks) here due to potential tax advantages when withdrawing later.
   - **IRA:** A mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments, depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on income-generating assets (like dividends) and consider tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, and withdrawals are taxed as income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of realizing capital gains and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - Adjust your allocations based on when you plan to access the funds. Longer-term savings can take on more risk compared to those you will need in the near term.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific situation, taking into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
