To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match since it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider traditional IRAs for their tax-deductibility features.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, maxing out a Roth IRA can be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that may be subject to lower capital gains taxes (like holding investments for over a year).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different account types based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution annually based on performance, changing goals, and tax considerations.
