Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify for a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing to this account next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k). This provides tax-deferred growth and reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts should be used for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains. Consider keeping short-term holdings or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds) to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly and rebalance if necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of withdrawal rules and tax implications associated with each account type.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
