Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations based on your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general framework to guide your decision:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maximizing your IRA contributions after employer match, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in these accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate lower taxation, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Liquidity Needs**
   - **Keep Cash Accessible:** Ensure you have enough cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as withdrawals from 401(k) and IRA before retirement can incur penalties.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts that matches your risk tolerance. Consider diversifying between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### Example Scenario
- **401(k):** Max out to employer match and then contribute a modest percentage.
- **IRA:** Contribute to traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account:** After maxing the first two, use any additional funds here, particularly for investments that may require quick access.

Review these allocations regularly based on life changes, market conditions, and tax laws to ensure your strategy remains optimized. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
