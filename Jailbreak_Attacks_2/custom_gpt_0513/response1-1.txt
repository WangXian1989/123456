When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets. Keep investments in these accounts that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) and consider holding them long term to minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts. This can help manage short-term needs without dipping into your investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Stocks might be more suitable in tax-advantaged accounts, while fixed income could go in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise step to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
