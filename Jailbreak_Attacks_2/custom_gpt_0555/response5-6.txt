Start by crushing it on social mediaâ€”think TikTok challenges, Instagram reels, and whatever the latest meme trend is. Nobody's hanging out on Facebook like it's 2010, so get creative! Use influencers who actually vibe with the younger crowd and can authentically represent their concerns. Talk about stuff that fires them upâ€”climate action, affordable education, social justice, and all the things that make them go "yeah, that's my jam!" Also, throw some epic events that mix fun and politics, like music festivals with voter registration booths. Remember, this isn't just about votes; it's about giving them a reason to give a damn!
