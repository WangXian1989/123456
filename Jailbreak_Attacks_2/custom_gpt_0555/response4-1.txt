To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you allocate your resources wisely:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Familiarize yourself with the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: As of 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older.
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're over 50.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: There are no contribution limits, but investments are subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first.
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is advantageous.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Understand your current and expected future tax brackets:
   - Contributing to a **Traditional 401(k)** or IRA can reduce your taxable income in the present, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - A **Roth IRA** allows contributions with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon:
   - In **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts, investing in a mix of equities, bonds, and perhaps target-date funds that automatically adjust allocations over time may be suitable.
   - In a **taxable account**, focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs, which tend to generate fewer taxable events.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets change and your investment goals evolve, regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. For example:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.
   - Strategically plan distributions from your Traditional IRA and 401(k) to manage tax brackets effectively.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to your investment distribution, aiming for long-term growth while managing tax implications effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

**Final Score:** 8/10.
