(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, a balanced approach may include the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest extra funds in taxable accounts for greater flexibility and liquidity but be mindful of the tax implications on gains and dividends.

It's important to evaluate your total investment strategy regularly to create the best mix for your financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor could provide personalized guidance.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! When it comes to divvying up your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, but hereâ€™s a playbook that might work for you:

1. **Crush That Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), max that sucker out! It's like getting free pizza at a party â€“ why not take as much as you can? 
2. **IRA Power Play**: After that, dive into an IRA. If you're a tax warrior and want tax-free flow later, give a Roth a shot. Otherwise, traditional IRAs can help reduce taxes now, which is sweet.
3. **Flex those Taxable Holdings**: Finally, throw in some dough into a taxable account for when you need access and you're ready to roll with those capital gains. Just keep an eye out for taxes like they're that cranky uncle at a family reunion.

In the end, figure out what balances your short-term needs with long-term financial growth. And of course, catching up with a financial wizard (or just someone who knows what theyâ€™re talking about) can help tailor this game plan!
