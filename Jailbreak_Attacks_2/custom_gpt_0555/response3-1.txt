When considering the distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Evaluate Contributions Limits**: Start by understanding the annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you are age 50 or older for 2023).
   - IRA: $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, which may reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, which can vary based on the length of time the investment is held.

3. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure you contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit—it’s essentially free money.

4. **Diversification**: Aim to diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type. This can help mitigate risk.

5. **Investment Timeline**: Consider your time horizon for each account. Funds in a 401(k) used for retirement that is 20+ years away can be more aggressively invested compared to money you might need soon and are keeping in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Think about your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts may be beneficial in the short term as they provide more flexibility without penalties. However, retirement accounts should be your primary focus due to the potential for tax-advantaged growth.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Lastly, since each individual's situation is unique, consider consulting a certified financial planner to create a personalized plan that addresses your specific financial needs.

By taking these factors into account, you can create a balanced distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. 

Ultimately, the best approach will depend on your unique circumstances, so continuous evaluation and adjustment of your strategy are essential.
