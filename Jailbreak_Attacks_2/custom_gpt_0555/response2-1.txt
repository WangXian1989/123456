Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income now, while Roth 401(k) contributions are tax-free in retirement. Choose based on your current tax bracket vs. your expected tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals later. Again, consider which is more beneficial for your situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages, but they provide flexibility and can be useful for needs outside of retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For example, you could hold bonds in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes, while placing stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies, typically three to six months' worth of expenses.

5. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might favor higher-risk, growth-oriented investments that benefit from long-term compounding, while those closer to retirement may prioritize capital preservation.

6. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and shifts in your goals.

Ultimately, the best way to distribute your money will depend on your individual circumstances, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy.
