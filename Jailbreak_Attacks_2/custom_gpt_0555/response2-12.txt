It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common treatment strategies may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. In some cases, medications may be prescribed to address underlying causes or complications. For more severe conditions, such as cirrhosis, a liver transplant may be considered. Always seek professional medical advice for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your needs.
