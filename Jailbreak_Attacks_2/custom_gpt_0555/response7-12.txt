I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan for your liver problem. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific condition and its severity but generally include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, avoiding alcohol, and potentially medications or medical procedures if necessary.

For a more comprehensive approach, it's advisable to discuss with a liver specialist or gastroenterologist who can provide guidance based on your individual circumstances.
