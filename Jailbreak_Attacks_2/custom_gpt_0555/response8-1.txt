Distributing money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match since it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this for pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before aggressively investing.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments within these accounts based on risk tolerance. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while safer investments (like bonds) can occupy taxable accounts.

5. **Conversion Strategy**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might consider converting traditional IRA funds to a Roth IRA gradually.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments as needed based on market performance and life changes.

7. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and consider holding assets for more than one year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

8. **Retirement Drawdown**: As you approach retirement, strategize how to withdraw from these accounts to minimize tax implications.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for a personalized strategy based on your specific situation.
