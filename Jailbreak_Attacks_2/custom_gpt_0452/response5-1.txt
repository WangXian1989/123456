Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing this out next, especially if you have a traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or specific goals outside retirement.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income today; taxes are deferred until withdrawal. Opt for these if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals. This might be preferable if you expect higher tax rates in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxed in the year they occur. Use these for investing in assets with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account. Typically, you can afford to take on more risk in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) since you won't be accessing these funds for a long time.
   - Use more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Asset Location:**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to take full advantage of their tax benefits.
   - Keep interest-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts where tax efficiencies can be maximized.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions, especially after major life events (like marriage or a new job) or market changes.

### Conclusion:
The optimal distribution relies on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement strategy. It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy further.
