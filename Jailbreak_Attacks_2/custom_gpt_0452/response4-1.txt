Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your long-term financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize this account until you reach the match limit. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer upfront tax benefits.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in a **401(k)** and **IRA** grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable accounts** incur taxes on dividends and capital gains. Hence, they’re often best for investments you plan to hold longer.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) due to their tax-deferred nature, while keeping more stable, less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is decades away, you may want to favor more aggressive growth strategies in your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Nearer to retirement, shift focus to preservation of capital and income-generating investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and adapt to changes in financial goals or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help you navigate complex strategies.

Adjust your contributions based on performance and changes in income or expenses over time.
