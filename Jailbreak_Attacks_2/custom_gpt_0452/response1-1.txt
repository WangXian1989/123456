Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket, a Roth IRA can be beneficial because withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRAs) since they have the potential to grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Hold more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax liability.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short to medium-term savings and investments. They allow for more flexibility and easier access but may incur capital gains taxes.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your investments periodically to ensure they align with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can build an effective strategy for distributing your investments.
