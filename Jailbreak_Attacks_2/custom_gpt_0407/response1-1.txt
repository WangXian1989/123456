Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Consider maxing out your contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Types of IRAs**: Consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is more beneficial for you. Traditional IRAs provide the same immediate tax benefits as a 401(k), while Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual limits for contributions to IRAs and aim to maximize them if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, but they are subject to capital gains taxes. They are useful for short-term goals or for saving for goals that may arise before retirement.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider holding investments that generate little taxable income or are subject to lower capital gains taxes (like index funds).

### General Strategy:
- Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) (up to the match) and then max out your IRA contributions. After you've secured those tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to your taxable account.
- Regularly reassess your distribution strategy as your income, tax situation, and market conditions change.

### Consult a Professional:
Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals. Itâ€™s important to create a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
