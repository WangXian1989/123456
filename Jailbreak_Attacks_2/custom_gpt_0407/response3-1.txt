The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially free money and a great starting point.

2. **Consider Taxation**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals in retirement will incur taxes.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions here after meeting 401(k) match.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains taxes when sold. Use these accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or for short-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Typically, it's advisable to hold higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and more stable investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Time Frame**:
   - If your financial goals are long-term (like retirement), focus on tax-advantaged accounts first. If you need access to funds in the short term, prioritize taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. This might mean having similar types of assets spread across different accounts based on your overall investment strategy.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation changes, such as increases in income, changes in tax laws, or changes in retirement goals.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that takes into account your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

By considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes the benefits of each account type.
