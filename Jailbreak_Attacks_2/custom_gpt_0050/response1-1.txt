Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider High-Earning Years**: If you're in a high tax bracket, maximizing contributions can reduce taxable income.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; opt for a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now.
   - **Limitations**: Be aware of income limits for Roth contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use this for more accessible investments, keeping in mind that you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or have lower turnover to minimize tax impacts.

### Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside before heavy investing.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate based on your personal risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Diversify**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) for risk management.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
