To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide upfront tax benefits.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) since they won't benefit from tax-deferred growth. This keeps your tax liabilities manageable.

3. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - Place higher growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where gains are sheltered from taxes until withdrawal.
   - Bonds and interest-generating assets may be better suited for taxable accounts due to the lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Adjust Based on Your Goals**:
   - If you need funds in the near future, keep a portion in taxable accounts. For long-term growth, prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Assess your allocations annually or when your situation changes (e.g., income changes, retirement goals) to ensure your distribution aligns with your financial goals.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize growth, minimize taxes, and maintain the flexibility needed for your financial plans.
