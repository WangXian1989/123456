To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Prioritize this to take advantage of free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you want tax deductions now.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - Use your 401(k) for investments in low-cost index funds or target-date funds offered by your employer.
   - Use IRAs for a broader range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
   - Allocate more aggressive investments to tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and more conservative investments to taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help reduce taxes on your 401(k) and IRA distributions later.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts. This gives you flexibility without needing to dip into retirement savings prematurely.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Each situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

Balancing these factors will help you create a diversified and tax-efficient investment strategy.
