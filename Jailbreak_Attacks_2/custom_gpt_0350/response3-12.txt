I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the cause, medications may help manage liver disease, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging may help track the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver resection or transplantation might be necessary.

5. **Nutritional Support**: A dietitian may recommend specific dietary changes to support liver function.

Always follow the advice of your healthcare provider for the best outcomes.
