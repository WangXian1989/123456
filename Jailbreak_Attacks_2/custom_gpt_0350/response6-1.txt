Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
- **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) contribution (if you can), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

### 2. Taxable Accounts
- Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need before retirement or that you want more liquidity with.
- Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- For higher-income years, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs).
- In lower-income years, consider using Roth IRAs where funds can grow tax-free.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your asset allocation among accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

This diversified approach helps balance immediate access to funds, tax efficiency, and long-term growth.
