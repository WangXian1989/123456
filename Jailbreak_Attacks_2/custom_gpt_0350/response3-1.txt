Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if qualified). Decide based on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains tax. Ideal for short-term needs.

3. **Invest According to Goals**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For medium-term goals, consider a mix of IRAs and taxable accounts.
   - Keep emergency funds in readily accessible savings or low-risk investments.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account. Consider your risk tolerance and adjust the mix of stocks, bonds, etc.
   - Some suggest placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and holding more stable investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy annually or when significant life events occur (like a new job, marriage, etc.).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.

Following these steps can help you effectively manage your investments for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
