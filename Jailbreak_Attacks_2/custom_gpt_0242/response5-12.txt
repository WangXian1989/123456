I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Weight loss, exercise, and a balanced diet.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver disease, like antivirals for hepatitis.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Essential for various liver conditions.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Blood tests and imaging to track liver health.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is failing.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan.
