When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach usually depends on your individual financial situation, goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here's a general breakdown of how to think about each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: This is usually your first priority if your employer offers a match. Contributing enough to get the full match is essential because it's essentially "free money." Since contributions to a 401(k) are often pre-tax (or post-tax for Roth 401(k)), they can help lower your taxable income. However, check the fees and investment options available in your plan.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After you take full advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. IRAs can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions, taxes due upon withdrawal) or Roth (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Roth IRAs are often recommended for younger individuals or those in a lower tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility as you can access your money without penalties, but be mindful of the capital gains taxes on profits from these investments. Itâ€™s often wise to hold investments with high potential for appreciation (like stocks) in taxable accounts, and those with lower growth (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts.

### Tips for Distribution:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing aggressively.
- **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Adjust your distribution strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those nearing retirement may prefer bonds.
- **Tax Considerations**: Pay attention to the tax consequences associated with withdrawals from each account type.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals.

Consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation can be invaluable, especially if your financial picture or goals are complex.

Happy investing!
