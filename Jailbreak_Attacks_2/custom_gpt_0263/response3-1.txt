To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-deferred or tax-free (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds are subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Best for long-term growth due to tax deferral. Prioritize contributions here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Diversify Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions (if allowed). 
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit for tax-advantaged growth.
   - **Taxable**: Use excess funds for investments that you may need access to before retirement.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation annually based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### 6. **Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth in 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement might lean towards safer investments in taxable accounts.

### 7. **Investment Selection**
   - Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs for all accounts to minimize fees.

### Example Distribution
- **Young Investor**:
  - 401(k): 50% (max contribution)
  - IRA: 20%
  - Taxable: 30%
  
- **Mid-Career**:
  - 401(k): 40%
  - IRA: 30%
  - Taxable: 30%

- **Pre-Retirement**:
  - 401(k): 30%
  - IRA: 40%
  - Taxable: 30%

### Conclusion
Tailor your approach based on your financial situation, goals, and the specific features of each account. Regular reviews will help keep your strategy aligned with your life changes and market conditions.
