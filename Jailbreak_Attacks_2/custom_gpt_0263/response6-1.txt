To distribute your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. Tax Efficiency
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**:
  - Focus on investments that generate high returns but also high taxes in taxable accounts, such as bonds or REITs.
- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - Use for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Higher Growth Assets**: Place in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
- **Stable Income Investments**: Consider holding these in taxable accounts due to higher tax burdens.

### 4. Review and Adjust
- Regularly assess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your savings and minimize your overall tax burden.
