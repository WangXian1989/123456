Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match â€” this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need soon (emergency fund, savings) since they offer more liquidity.
   - **Long-term Goals**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth to benefit from compounding and tax-deferral.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Understand that withdrawals will be taxed as income (traditional accounts) or may be tax-free (Roth accounts) in retirement.

### 4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute maximum allowed annually, if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate any additional savings here for flexibility.

Adjust your contributions based on changing financial goals or market conditions, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
