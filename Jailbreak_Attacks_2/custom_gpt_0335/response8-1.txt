The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider tax implications**: Contributions are tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose the right type**: A Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max out contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable accounts**:
   - **Invest for flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer liquidity and can be accessed without penalty, making them suitable for shorter-term goals.
   - **Focus on tax-efficient investments**: Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Prioritize contributions** based on tax benefits and match availability.
2. **Diversify investments** across all account types for balance.
3. **Rebalance periodically** to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Assess your current financial situation and future goals, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
