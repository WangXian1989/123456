Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now. Focus on maxing this out to get tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Assess whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) fits your situation better. If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you may need before retirement or after you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Capital gains taxes apply to earnings, but you can also benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Consider your overall investment strategy. Stocks might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and tax treatment. Bonds could be more appropriate in taxable accounts where you face ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Invest tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability. Index funds or ETFs that have low turnover are typically more tax-efficient.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, youâ€™ll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly, tax-free accounts if possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex or you have substantial amounts invested, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

This approach helps balance immediate tax advantages with long-term growth and liquidity needs. Would you like more details on any specific area?
