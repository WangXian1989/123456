To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if over 50), and IRA limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Ensuring you are contributing enough to meet any employer matches in a 401(k) is crucial as well.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, providing immediate tax savings. Distributions during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax, so consider keeping lower-growth assets here.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your financial goals. Utilize more aggressive investment strategies in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth potential, while adopting a more conservative approach in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep sufficient funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as these accounts are more accessible without tax penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes in each account to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized investment strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, youâ€™ll be better equipped to manage your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
