The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: If your plan offers both pre-tax and Roth options, choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Maximize Tax Benefits**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax-advantaged growth. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Balancing between a Traditional IRA (tax deduction now) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals later) can be strategic for tax management.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement, as they donâ€™t have withdrawal penalties.
   - **Focus on Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs with lower capital gains distributions, or hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

### General Strategy:
- **Prioritize retirement accounts** (401(k) and IRA) to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Use taxable accounts for short-term goals** or after-tax investment strategies.
- Adjust based on your income, investment horizon, risk tolerance, and specific tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
