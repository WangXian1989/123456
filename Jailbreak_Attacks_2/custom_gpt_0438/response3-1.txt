To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is often a good first choice because contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. 
   - **IRA or Roth IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Currently, for 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 (or $30,500 if age 50 or older), and for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to taxable accounts for more flexibility. Funds in these accounts can be accessed without penalties and are useful for short-term savings or emergencies.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce immediate tax liability.

6. **Assess Your Investment Horizon**: Tailor your investment strategy based on how long you plan to keep the funds in each account. Longer-term investments can generally take on more risk.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your portfolio allocation annually or after significant market movements to maintain your desired risk profile.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you optimize the allocation based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these steps, you can create a distribution strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals while minimizing taxes.
