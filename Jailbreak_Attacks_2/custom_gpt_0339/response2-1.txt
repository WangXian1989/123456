Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates. This can include stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax bracket. Utilize tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments and consider placing more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk assets may be suitable for long-term retirement accounts, while conservative investments may work better in taxable accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.
