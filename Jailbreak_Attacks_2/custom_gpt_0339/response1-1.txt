Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals and situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA contributions if you can benefit from tax advantages. Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexible investing. Focus on funds that generate low capital gains, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

### Considerations:
- **Tax Bracket**: Higher income may favor tax-deferred accounts.
- **Withdrawal Plans**: Plan for how and when you’ll access funds.
- **Investment Horizon**: Longer-term goals may benefit from more aggressive investments.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
