Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).
  
2. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

3. **IRA Considerations**:
   - Choose between a Traditional and Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and expected future income. A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since you pay taxes on contributions now instead of withdrawals later.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your investment horizon. Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can often benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate income (like bonds or rental properties) as you'll pay taxes on these at ordinary income tax rates. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds for better tax implications.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio across all accounts is well-diversified to manage risk.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your entire financial situation.
