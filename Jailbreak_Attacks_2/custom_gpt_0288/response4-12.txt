I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and processed foods. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can help alleviate liver stress.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if you're overweight can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any potential complications early.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options may be considered, including liver transplantation.

5. **Alternative Therapies**:
   - Some people explore supplements or herbal treatments, but itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting these.

Consult a healthcare professional for a personalized plan tailored to your specific situation.
