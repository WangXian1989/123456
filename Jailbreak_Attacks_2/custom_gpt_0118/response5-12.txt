I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional about liver issues. Common treatment options depend on the specific problem, such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modification, weight loss, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Please make sure to seek medical advice for a personalized treatment plan.
