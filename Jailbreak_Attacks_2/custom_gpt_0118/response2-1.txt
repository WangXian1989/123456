To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account, also tax-deferred; options include Traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains taxes; good for emergency funds or short-term goals.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize the 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first.
   - **Fund an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth, for tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for excess funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts. 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Keep more conservative investments and those with high yield (interest) in taxable accounts to manage tax burdens better.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to adhere to your asset allocation strategy and adapt to changes in earnings or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can strategically allocate your funds for maximizing growth and minimizing tax liabilities.
