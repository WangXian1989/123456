To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out contributions to your IRA** if you're eligible, focusing first on a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
   - If you still have funds after maxing out the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to benefit from lower tax rates.
   - High-growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, allowing for tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diverse mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type while considering your overall risk tolerance.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to adjust for changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain adequate liquidity in a high-yield savings account before heavily investing to cover unforeseen expenses.

This approach balances growth potential, risk management, and tax efficiency.
