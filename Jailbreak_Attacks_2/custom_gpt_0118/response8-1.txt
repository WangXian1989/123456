Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower tax impacts, like index funds.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread out investments across different asset classes in each account to balance risk and return.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings outside of retirement accounts for immediate needs.

5. **Retirement Planning**: As you approach retirement, consider tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Typically, you might want to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary greatly, so tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help you align your investment strategy with your financial goals.
