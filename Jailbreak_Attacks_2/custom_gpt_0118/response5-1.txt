To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits for Traditional IRAs; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. Prioritize holding investments that appreciate in value long-term here.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement Focus**: Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions first for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need sooner, ensuring liquidity.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay updated on contribution limits for 401(k) and IRA accounts to maximize tax benefits.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
