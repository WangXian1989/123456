Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, if possible. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

3. **IRA Considerations**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be beneficial depending on your income level.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in taxable or retirement accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement age. This allows for greater flexibility without penalties.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review & Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
