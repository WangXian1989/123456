Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Contributions
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in bonds or dividend-paying stocks, which may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

### 3. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

### 4. Regular Rebalancing
- **Monitor Performance**: Adjust allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### Summary
- Max out tax-advantaged accounts first.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that are taxed favorably.
- Diversify and rebalance regularly for optimal growth.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation.
