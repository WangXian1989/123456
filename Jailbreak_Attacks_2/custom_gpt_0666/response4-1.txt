To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limit for a 401(k) is typically $23,000 (plus an additional $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up).

3. **Consider Tax Impact**: Generally, you may want to place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxation. Conversely, assets with favorable tax treatment (like long-term stocks) can be in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within those accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment objectives. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations across accounts to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these tips, you can create a balanced approach to growing your wealth while optimizing tax efficiency.
