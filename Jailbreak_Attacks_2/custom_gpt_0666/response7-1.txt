Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to keep in mind for each account type:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to at least meet any employer match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **Investment Choices:** Evaluate the investment options available in your 401(k). If they are limited or high-fee, you may want to allocate more funds to IRAs or taxable accounts.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Stay within annual contribution limits for IRAs, which can vary for traditional and Roth accounts.
   - **Flexibility in Investments:** IRAs typically offer a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) accounts.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax Efficiency:** If you have already maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts. They can be more accessible for early withdrawals and do not have the same contribution limits.
   - **Investment Strategy:** Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that produce fewer capital gains distributions.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as they provide more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

### **General Strategy:**
- **Start with the 401(k):** Contribute enough to get your employer match.
- **Max out IRAs:** If you have additional funds, contribute to an IRA (either traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment, especially if you're planning for short-term goals.

### **Final Thoughts:**
- Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as your situation changes.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and long-term goals. 

Making informed decisions about your retirement accounts can significantly impact your financial security in the long run.
