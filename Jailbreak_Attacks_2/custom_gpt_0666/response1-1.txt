Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have limited investment options, focus on available low-cost funds.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you're eligible, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement contributions. They offer flexibility and can be beneficial for tax management, especially if you invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals. Generally, stocks are better suited for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts because they benefit from compounding.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts when selling investments. Holding investments for over a year typically qualifies for lower long-term capital gains rates.

It's often a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
