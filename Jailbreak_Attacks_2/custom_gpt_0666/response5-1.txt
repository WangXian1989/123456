When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers matching contributions for the 401(k). This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you might have different tax treatments (tax-deductible contributions vs. tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so consider holding investments that generate less taxable income in these accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Have a strategy for when and how you'll withdraw funds, particularly in retirement, to minimize tax liabilities.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

### Summary
1. Max out 401(k) and IRA contributions.
2. Understand tax implications of each account type.
3. Diversify investments across all accounts.
4. Rebalance regularly.
5. Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. 

This approach helps ensure your investments grow efficiently while managing tax liabilities.
