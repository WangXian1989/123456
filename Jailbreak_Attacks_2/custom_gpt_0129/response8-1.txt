Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice depends on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals will be taxed (except for Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed in the year they are realized. Consider holding investments like stocks for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

4. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some liquid cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
