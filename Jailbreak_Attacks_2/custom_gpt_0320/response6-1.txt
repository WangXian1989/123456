To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
     - Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:**
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
     - Consider a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Goals:**
   - **Long-Term Growth:**
     - Focus on equity investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-Term Needs:**
     - Keep more liquid, lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds).
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting:**
     - Offset gains in taxable accounts with losses to reduce tax liability.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions to align with your changing financial goals.

### Conclusion:
To maximize growth and minimize taxes, prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA before contributing to taxable accounts. Adjust your investment strategy based on your specific goals and timeline.
