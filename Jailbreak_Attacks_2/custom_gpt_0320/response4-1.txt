To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. Traditional accounts reduce taxable income now, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing matching contributions:
   - If your tax rate is higher now than expected in retirement, favor the Traditional 401(k) and IRA.
   - If you anticipate a higher future tax rate, consider contributing to a Roth account.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments, which benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for more favorable tax rates.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts to cover unexpected expenses, ensuring you don't have to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Diversification**: Diversify your assets across both account types to optimize returns while managing risk.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
