Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider putting money into an IRA (Roth or Traditional). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide upfront tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out the IRA (if possible), contribute more to your 401(k). This often has higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or as a flexible investment option. They’re useful for emergency funds or large purchases.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment choices across all accounts are diversified to balance risk and return. Review your asset allocation regularly based on life changes and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances and goals.
