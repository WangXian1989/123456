The best way to distribute your money across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxes**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings can be taxed annually, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for the order of withdrawals in retirement. Often, itâ€™s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.
