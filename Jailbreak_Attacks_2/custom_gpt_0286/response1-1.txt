To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing the 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance growth.

3. **Focus on Tax Diversification**: 
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions are tax-deductible; withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for goals outside retirement, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can be spread across accounts to balance risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your portfolio to ensure it matches your desired allocation, adjusting as necessary across accounts.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement, as this can impact tax liabilities.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual situation.
