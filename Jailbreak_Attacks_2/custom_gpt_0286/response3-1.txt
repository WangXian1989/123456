To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, 401(k) contributions max out at $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and IRA contributions at $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match before investing in other accounts. This is essentially free money.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like growth stocks or index funds) in taxable accounts, as they are subject to capital gains taxes rather than ordinary income taxes. 
   - Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (such as bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Roth vs. Traditional Account Decisions**: 
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax rate, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

6. **Diversification**: 
   - Maintain diversification across all accounts to mitigate risk and enhance growth potential. This includes a mix of asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash.

7. **Review and Adjust Annually**: 
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
