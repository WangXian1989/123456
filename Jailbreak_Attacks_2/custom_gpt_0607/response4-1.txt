Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Contribute Enough to Get the Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Higher Contributions:** Depending on your income, consider maximizing your contributions if you are in a lower tax bracket, as this reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Generally good for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** Suitable if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Contributions are post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year, balancing between this and your 401(k) contributions based on your financial situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest In Tax-Efficient Funds:** Choose funds that minimize capital gains distributions. Index funds and ETFs are often more tax-efficient.
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals:** Taxable accounts can be useful for goals within a 5-year time frame or flexibility needs, as they offer easier access to funds.
   - **Consider Tax-Loss Harvesting:** This strategy can offset gains with losses, potentially reducing your tax burden.

### Strategy Example:
- **Max your 401(k)** up to the match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (prioritize Roth if eligible and your tax rate is low).
- **Allocate remaining funds** to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Rebalancing:
- Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on your investment performance and any changes in financial goals or tax situations.

### Consult a Financial Advisor:
- For tailored advice considering your unique circumstances, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor. They can help optimize your tax strategies and investment allocations based on your specific needs.

Always consider your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance when making these decisions.
