I'm not a doctor, but here are some general options people often consider for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or enhance liver function.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Eliminating alcohol can prevent further liver damage and improve overall health.

4. **Regular Check-ups**: Monitoring liver function through blood tests can help manage the condition more effectively.

5. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements (like vitamin E or milk thistle), but consult a doctor before starting any.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
