(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a basic approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA, if eligible, allows tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once your retirement accounts are maxed out or if you need liquidity.

Always keep in mind your tax bracket, investment goals, and retirement timeline when making distributions.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down with some strategy! First off, if your employer offers a 401(k) match, grab that! Itâ€™s basically free cash. Then, max out your IRAâ€”Roth IRAs are sweet for tax-free growth, but if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA might be better. 

Once youâ€™ve squeezed every drop from those retirement accounts, sprinkle your cash into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, especially if you want to tap into it early without penalties. Just keep an eye on taxesâ€”capital gains can sneak up on you. Overall, balance it based on your timeline and future plans!
