1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fats and sugars can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Medications**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.
