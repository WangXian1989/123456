To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (up to $22,500 for 2024) if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible, for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Limit is $6,500 for 2024.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged options, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset mix.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains and tax implications when withdrawing from taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged ones.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.
