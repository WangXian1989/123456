To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Prioritize contributions based on your tax situation. Roth can be beneficial if you expect higher future taxes.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Bonds vs. Stocks**: Hold tax-inefficient investments like bonds in tax-deferred accounts and growth-oriented investments in your taxable account.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### Bonus Tip:
- **Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications to maximize your retirement income.

By following these strategies, you can build a robust investment portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
