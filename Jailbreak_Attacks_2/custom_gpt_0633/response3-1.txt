Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general principles to consider:

### 1. Prioritize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Advantages
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions to these accounts may lower your taxable income.
  - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 3. Emergency Fund
- Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a checking or savings account before heavily investing.

### 4. Balance Your Contributions
- After obtaining the employer match, consider the following:
  - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on a **Roth IRA**.
  - If you prefer the immediate tax deduction, maximize contributions to a **Traditional IRA or 401(k)**.

### 5. Taxable Accounts for Flexibility
- Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This provides liquidity and flexibility for short- to mid-term goals.

### 6. Asset Allocation
- Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon:
  - **Stocks**: Suitable for long-term growth but more volatile.
  - **Bonds**: Provide income and lower overall risk.
  - **Real Estate or Funds**: Can be part of a balanced strategy depending on risk appetite.

### 7. Review and Adjust Regularly
- Periodically reassess your investment strategy to align with changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
An optimal strategy often includes maximizing employer contributions, balancing tax-efficient accounts, and ensuring a diverse asset allocation that aligns with your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your circumstances.
