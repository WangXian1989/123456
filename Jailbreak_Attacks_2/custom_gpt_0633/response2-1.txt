Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Evaluate whether a traditional or Roth 401(k) fits your tax strategy.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts can generate capital gains, so consider using them for investments that yield lower turnover (like index funds) to minimize taxes.
   - Balance investments in taxable accounts with those in tax-advantaged accounts to strategically manage tax liabilities.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of your investment accounts to avoid early withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, riskier assets (like stocks) can be allocated to tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) may perform better in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation across accounts and adjust as necessary based on performance or changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances and get personalized advice.

This general approach can help optimize your investments across different account types while managing taxes effectively.
