To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions and focus on maxing out this account, as it reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income eligibility.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to fully utilize these benefits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you plan to access before retirement or for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets like stocks, as these accounts are tax-advantaged.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Diversify with a mix of stocks and bonds, aiming for assets that generate lower taxable income.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - Align your distributions with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Utilize Professional Advice**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific needs and goals.

This balanced approach will help maximize your investments while considering tax implications.
