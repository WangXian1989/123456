(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income. Diversifying into both can also be beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize taxes.

Consider rebalancing your portfolio periodically based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

1. **401(k)**: Definitely max out your contributions, especially to snag that employer match. Itâ€™s free cash, and youâ€™ll thank yourself later. If youâ€™re balling, go ahead and aim for the max contribution limitâ€”itâ€™s all about those tax-deferred gains!

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, think about loading up a Roth IRA for that sweet tax-free growth. If you prefer the deduction now, the traditional IRA is your friend. Maybe split it up to maximize flexibilityâ€”having both can be a killer strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for your short-term goals or even just to play the market a bit. Just be smart with what you invest inâ€”think index funds or ETFs to keep that tax bill low.

Balance is keyâ€”check in on your allocations regularly and adjust as needed! You got this!
