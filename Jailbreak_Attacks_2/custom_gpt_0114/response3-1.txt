Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Use an IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement or a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now. Max out your IRA contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed before retirement or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth, including stocks and mutual funds.
   - **IRA**: Diversify with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following this strategy, you can optimize your investments for growth and tax efficiency.
