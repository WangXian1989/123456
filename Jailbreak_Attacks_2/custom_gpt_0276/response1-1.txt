Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth if you qualify.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the match, contribute more to your 401(k), especially if you have higher income and want to reduce taxable income.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once retirement accounts are maximized, use taxable accounts for:
     - Short-term goals (e.g., buying a house).
     - Investments that may benefit from capital gains rates.

### 5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.
   - Keep high-growth or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Key Factors to Consider
- **Age and Retirement Timeline:** Younger individuals may prefer more aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Income Level:** Higher earners might benefit from more contributions to tax-deferred accounts.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility:** Taxable accounts provide easier access if you need funds before retirement.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach that maximizes tax advantages while maintaining flexibility is usually best. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
