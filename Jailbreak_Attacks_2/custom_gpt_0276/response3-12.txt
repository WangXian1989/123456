   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: For primary biliary cholangitis.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.
