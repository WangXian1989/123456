To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (whichever suits your tax situation).

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+ for 2024)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+ for 2024)

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., stocks, ETFs).
   - **Bonds and Income-Producing Assets**: Place these in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) here.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Use losses in taxable accounts to offset gains for tax efficiency.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio based on performance and your changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution
- Contribute 10% of salary to 401(k) until match is met.
- Max out IRA contributions next.
- Contribute any additional savings to taxable accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual situation, focusing on your risk tolerance and retirement goals.
