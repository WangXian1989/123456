I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit fats, sugars, and processed foods.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance:** Stop drinking alcohol to help reduce further liver damage.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Medications:** For viral hepatitis, medications like ribavirin or direct-acting antiviral agents may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** For autoimmune liver disorders, drugs that suppress the immune response might be used.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Liver Function Tests:** Regular blood tests to monitor liver enzymes and function.
   - **Imaging:** Ultrasounds or CT scans to assess liver structure.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
