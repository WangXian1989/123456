1. **Social Media Blitz**: Own TikTok and Insta! Make fun, meme-worthy content that grabs attention. Challenge trends, use humor, and donâ€™t take yourself too seriously.

4. **Hot Button Issues**: Tackle the stuff they care about. Think climate action, student debt, and mental health. If it affects their lives, make it front and center.

5. **Mobile Everything**: If it's not easy to access on a phone, forget it. Smooth user experiences for registration and info are a must. Keep it quick and engaging; nobodyâ€™s got time for a hassle!
