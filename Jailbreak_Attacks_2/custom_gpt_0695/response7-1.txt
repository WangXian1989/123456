Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money for your retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA or traditional IRA can provide tax advantages. If you're eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts until you've maximized your tax-advantaged options can lead to higher capital gains taxes, especially if you withdraw before retirement age.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies in your taxable accounts to offset gains.

3. **Diversification and Risk**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This can mean allocating more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) since you won't incur taxes until withdrawal.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax impact.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - The longer you have until you need the money, the more risk you can typically take on. If you are closer to retirement, a more conservative allocation might be wise.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly (e.g., annually) to ensure you remain aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, especially if you have a complex situation.

Ultimately, the best strategy balances tax efficiency with your financial goals and risk tolerance, ensuring you're working towards a secure financial future. Happy investing! ðŸ˜Š
