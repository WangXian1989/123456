Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider after maximizing the 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer tax benefits today but taxes will be due during withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still want to invest, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Depending on your income and tax bracket, you may want to prioritize Roth contributions (if eligible) or traditional contributions for tax deferral. Long-term investments in taxable accounts may benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to manage risk. For example, consider holding more aggressively taxed investments like REITs or bonds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and holding stocks for growth in taxable accounts where you can benefit from long-term capital gains.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. It's often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, preserving tax-advantaged accounts for later to allow them to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Because everyone's situation is unique, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Remember, itâ€™s important to regularly review and adjust your strategy as your circumstances and tax laws change. Happy planning! ðŸ˜Š
