When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider to optimize your retirement savings and minimize taxes. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if your plan has good investment options and low fees. The contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) match, evaluate whether to contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can start contributing to taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for short- to mid-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place investments with high tax burdens (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and investments with lower tax burdens (like index funds or stocks) in taxable accounts. This strategy can help minimize your overall tax liability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or semi-annually to ensure you’re on track to meet your goals and adjust for any changes in your risk tolerance or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: These strategies can vary based on individual financial circumstances, so it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize growth and minimize taxes. Remember, each individual's financial situation is unique, so tailor your strategy accordingly!
