When considering the distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including tax implications, your overall financial goals, time horizon, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help you evaluate the best distribution:

1. **Understand the Types of Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals). Consider income limits for Roth contributions and the tax impact of withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Dividends and interest are also taxed in the year earned.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Max out your employer’s 401(k) match first; it’s essentially free money.
   - Then contribute to your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - After reaching those accounts' limits, consider contributions to taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to take advantage of tax-free or tax-deferred growth.
   - Consider placing bonds or interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to minimize risk and maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Ensure that you regularly rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes and meet cash flow needs. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts as needed.

6. **Long-Term Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - Identify your financial goals (retirement age, lifestyle in retirement, etc.) and determine how each account fits into your overall strategy. Consider your time horizon for each goal to prioritize where to invest.

7. **Stay Informed and Adjust:**
   - Market conditions and personal circumstances change. Regularly review your strategy and adjust contributions and allocations accordingly.

It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation. They can provide tailored insights and strategies to ensure your investment approach aligns with your long-term financial goals.
