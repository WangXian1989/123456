(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation. Generally, a common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." Once you've taken full advantage of the 401(k), consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax considerations. After maximizing retirement account contributions, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

It's also important to diversify your investments within these accounts depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance, younger investors might lean more heavily into stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer a more conservative allocation. Consulting with a financial advisor can help you tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances.
