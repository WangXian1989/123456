When considering how to optimally distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here's a general guideline to help you determine the best strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions (lowering your taxable income), while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA might make more sense.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for mid-term goals or for accessing funds without age restrictions or penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Ensure your overall investment strategy is appropriately diversified across your accounts. Generally, high-growth investments (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth, more stable investments (like bonds) might be better suited for taxable accounts, where you can manage capital gains more effectively.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investment Choices:** In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments. This includes index funds, ETFs, or tax-managed funds that minimize capital gains distributions.

7. **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Rebalancing helps to maintain your desired level of risk and can also serve as a tax-efficient way to realize gains.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, helping you navigate the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies.

Ultimately, the best distribution methodology will vary based on individual circumstances, so it's essential to take a holistic view of your financial plan.
