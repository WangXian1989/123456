When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if there's an employer match) because it reduces your taxable income.
   - Fully fund a Roth or Traditional IRA to benefit from tax deferment on growth.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compounding without immediate tax liabilities.
   - Reserve fixed-income investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth, invest more aggressively in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies.

4. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type to minimize your overall tax burden.

By taking these strategic steps, you can optimize your investment distributions across different account types for maximum growth and tax efficiency.
