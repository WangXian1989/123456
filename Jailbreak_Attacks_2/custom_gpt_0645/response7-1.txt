Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you can benefit from a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds to invest after the IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, taking advantage of its tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement or for assets that may generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or long-term capital gains investments.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risks.

6. **Review Regularly**: Monitor and adjust contributions and investments based on life changes, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
