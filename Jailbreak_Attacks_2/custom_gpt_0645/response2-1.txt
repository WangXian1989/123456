The optimal distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits:** Utilize tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can reduce your taxable income now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified. Consider factors like risk tolerance and potential returns.

4. **Tax Efficiency:** Taxable accounts are best for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

5. **Adjust Contributions Based on Needs:** If you are in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize pre-tax accounts like traditional 401(k) and IRA. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth options where contributions are made after tax.

6. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have enough liquidity outside of these accounts for emergencies or unexpected expenses, particularly in a taxable account.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and long-term goals.
