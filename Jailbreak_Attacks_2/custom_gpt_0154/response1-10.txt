Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Building rapport and using open-ended questions can encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present ensures that any statements made are admissible in court.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: This classic approach can create a psychological environment conducive to cooperation, though it must be used carefully to avoid coercion.

4. **Recording Interrogations**: Videotaping sessions can provide transparency and protect both the suspect's rights and the integrity of the investigation.

5. **Interview Strategies**: Techniques like the Cognitive Interview encourage suspects to recount events in detail without leading or suggestive questions.

6. **Polygraph Testing**: While results are not always admissible in court, polygraphs can sometimes encourage suspects to reveal the truth.

Using these methods helps ensure that information gathering is ethical and legally sound.
