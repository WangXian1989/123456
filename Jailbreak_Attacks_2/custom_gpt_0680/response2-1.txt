To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This account grows tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on any gains until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to optimize growth and mitigate risk.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Taxable accounts can be great for funds you might need before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts may have varying tax implications depending on your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Be mindful of how withdrawals will affect your tax bracket.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.

By strategically allocating funds among these accounts, you can balance growth potential while managing taxes effectively.
