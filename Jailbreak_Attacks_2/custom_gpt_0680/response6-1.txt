Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, make the maximum contribution to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be useful for short-term goals since they allow for easier access to funds without penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Investments in 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-deferred, which can help you build wealth faster since you don't pay taxes on growth until withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Allocate a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to maintain a balanced portfolio.
   - Consider placing higher growth investments in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and interest.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds during retirement. Taking funds from taxable accounts first in early retirement can help preserve tax-advantaged accounts for later years.

### Summary
- Start with maximizing tax advantages in your 401(k) and IRA.
- Carefully balance your investment strategy across all accounts with an eye on taxes.
- Adapt your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
