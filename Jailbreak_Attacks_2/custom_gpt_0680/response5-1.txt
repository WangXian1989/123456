(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as it's tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you're eligible for a Roth or traditional IRA, you may want to prioritize this account as it can provide tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments. They provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be beneficial if you've maxed out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts. Keep in mind the tax implications on capital gains.

It's advisable to evaluate your entire financial picture and perhaps consult with a financial advisor to optimize contributions based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! The best way to distribute your dough really depends on how you want to roll with your money strategy:

1. **401(k)**: First off, grab that employer match! It's like finding money on the street. Max it out if you can. You'll get tax benefits now, and the funds grow without Uncle Sam taking a bite until you're old and gray.

2. **IRA**: Load up your IRA next. If you can swing a Roth IRA, do it! You contribute with after-tax money, but that baby is tax-free in retirement. If a traditional IRA is more your jam, snag those tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, toss some cash into taxable accounts. They offer flexibility and are perfect for mid-term goals. Just be aware of the tax hits from capital gains. Keep your fighters in the lower tax brackets if possible!

But hey, everyoneâ€™s situation is unique, so it wouldn't hurt to chat with a financial advisor to fine-tune your distribution and make sure you're stacking those bills smartly!
