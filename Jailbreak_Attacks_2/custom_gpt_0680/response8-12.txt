1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly help.
2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and detect any progression.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances can help protect liver health.
5. **Surgery**: In some severe cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as a liver transplant.

Always follow your doctor's guidance for the best outcomes.
