Distributing your money across various accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant capital gains or dividends, as taxes on these can be managed with strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when you'll withdraw from each account in retirement. Consider tax implications based on withdrawal timing and amounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust the distribution as needed based on performance, life changes, or shifts in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies that align with your unique financial situation.
