The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to at least get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023) for tax-advantaged growth.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are generally best for funds you may need in the short term, as they don’t offer tax advantages and can be taxed on capital gains and interest. Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to minimize taxes.

3. **Consider Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts intended for long-term goals (401(k), IRA) where capital gains can grow tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments or for liquidity needs.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified mix of assets aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, keeping in mind that the tax implications of withdrawals will vary based on the type of account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax liabilities in retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your distribution strategy annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

It's advised to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific needs.
