Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a common approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing the maximum to your 401(k) if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide upfront tax deductions. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. In taxable accounts, consider low-turnover investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. You may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts where you don't expect to withdraw money soon.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
