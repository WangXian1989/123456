To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer matches contributions, prioritize maximizing that match.
   - **IRA**: If you have a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but has income limits for contributions. Consider which tax structure benefits you more.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts do not offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility and access to funds before retirement age without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate funds based on your time horizon. If you're saving for retirement, max out tax-advantaged accounts first. For shorter-term goals, use taxable accounts for their liquidity.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across accounts maintain a diversified portfolio to reduce risk. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. In 2024, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $23,000 (or $30,500 if youâ€™re over 50). IRA contributions are limited to $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type to minimize overall tax liability.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

**Sample Distribution Strategy**:
- Max out your employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, or a traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts while maintaining your overall investment strategy.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
