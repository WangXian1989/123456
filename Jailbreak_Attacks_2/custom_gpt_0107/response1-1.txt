Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.
   - If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**:
   - Once you’ve maximized your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement, or for strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds).

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth, lean toward stocks in tax-advantaged accounts. Use bonds or stable value investments in taxable accounts to manage risk.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation annually based on your goals and market conditions.
