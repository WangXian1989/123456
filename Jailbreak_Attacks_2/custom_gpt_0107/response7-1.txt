To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Max out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) before investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs) since withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (traditional or Roth), consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and index funds. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals, making them suitable for higher growth investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for taxable investments like dividend stocks or municipal bonds, which can be more tax-efficient.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a separate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing too heavily.

5. **Consider Time Horizon**: Allocate more to riskier investments if you have a longer time until retirement. As you approach retirement, shift toward more conservative investments.

6. **Review Regularly**: Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust based on life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance can also be beneficial.
