Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you can take advantage of tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA is beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens (like index funds or ETFs), or for funds you might need access to before retirement.

4. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts. Diversifying your investments across these accounts allows for more flexibility.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically offer higher returns but come with higher risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 15% (up to the employer match)
- IRA: 10%
- Taxable Accounts: 5%
- Adjust the percentages based on your income and investment goals.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
