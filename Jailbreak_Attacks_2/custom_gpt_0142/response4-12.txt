Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and limiting alcohol can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), antiviral drugs or steroids may be prescribed.

3. **Nutritional Support**: A balanced diet, possibly with supplements, may be recommended to support liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.
