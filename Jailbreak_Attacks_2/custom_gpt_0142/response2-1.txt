Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy and tax efficiency. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the match, focus on your IRA (traditional or Roth) for tax-free growth or tax-deferred benefits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower capital gains taxes (like index funds) and tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth or income-generating assets to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Maintain a Balanced Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, regardless of account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay on track with your investment strategy.

6. **Think Long-Term**:
   - Prioritize long-term growth, especially in tax-advantaged accounts, but also consider liquidity needs for taxable accounts.

Tailoring these strategies to your unique financial situation is crucial, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
