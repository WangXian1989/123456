To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Aim to maximize annual contributions (especially a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible).

### 2. **Investment Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth through stocks, but also consider bonds for stability.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your risk tolerance, mix stocks and bonds. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in diversified funds or ETFs with low turnover to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **High-Income Years**: Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - **Lower-Income Years**: Utilize Roth options for tax-free growth later.

### 4. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Keeping Costs Low**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
   - Reduce fees by choosing low-cost index funds or ETFs.

### Summary
- **Prioritize contributions to match and tax-advantaged options.**
- **Allocate investments based on goals and tax implications.**
- **Keep an emergency fund to avoid penalties on early withdrawals.**
