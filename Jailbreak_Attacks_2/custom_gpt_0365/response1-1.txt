Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions if eligible, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket, as it offers tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
- **Pre-Tax Accounts (like 401(k)):** Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Roth Accounts (like Roth IRA):** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts:** You’ll pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for favorable tax treatment.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
Adjust your asset allocation based on changing market conditions and your risk tolerance.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
For tailored advice based on your specific situation, it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor.

This flexible approach allows you to maximize tax benefits while preparing for a secure retirement.
