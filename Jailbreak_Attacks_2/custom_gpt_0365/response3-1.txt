Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA next, depending on your eligibility and tax implications.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax and grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits as 401(k) but with different limits and rules. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments grow tax-free, but dividends and capital gains are taxed each year.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - If your current tax rate is lower, traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) may help reduce your taxable income now.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your asset allocation across these accounts aligns with your risk tolerance. Typically, stocks are recommended for long-term growth, while bonds provide income stability.

### 5. **Reevaluate Periodically**
   - Review your investments and contributions every year or after significant life changes to ensure your strategy remains aligned with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: 15% of your salary, up to the company match.
2. **IRA**: Max out the contribution (e.g., $6,500/year or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after the above contributions.

### Conclusion
Tailor this approach based on your specific financial situation and goals, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
