Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be strategic for maximizing growth and managing tax liability. Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is free money.
   - **Contribute to IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA (for tax-free growth) or a traditional IRA (for tax-deferred growth).

### 2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the limits for contributions:
     - **401(k):** $22,500 (2023) plus a $7,500 catch-up if over age 50.
     - **IRA:** $6,500 (2023) plus a $1,000 catch-up.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Consider your risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate investments across accounts.
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Hold higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts to maximize compounding.
   - **Income-Producing Assets in Taxable Accounts:** Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consider Taxes:**
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income. Plan your withdrawals to manage tax liability, especially in retirement.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Tailor your strategy to your individual financial situation, goals, and retirement timeline.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 60% of contributions (maxing out employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA:** 30% of contributions
- **Taxable Accounts:** 10% for flexibility and liquidity.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your portfolio for growth while managing tax implications effectively.
