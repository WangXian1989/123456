To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider fully funding a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you understand the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, for example, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus catch-up contributions if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Use low-cost index funds or ETFs for broad exposure.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Favor tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and adapt to changes in your financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
