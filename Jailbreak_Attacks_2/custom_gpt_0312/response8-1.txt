Dividing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy:

1. **401(k)**:
   - Maximize employer matching first. This is "free" money.
   - Contribute to the maximum if your budget allows, especially if your tax bracket is higher.

2. **IRA/Roth IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider traditional IRAs for potential tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use for short-term needs or to invest after maximizing retirement accounts.
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., index funds), and be mindful of capital gains taxes.

**General Tips**:
- Prioritize high-interest debt repayment before investing.
- Review your investment strategy periodically based on risk tolerance and financial goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
