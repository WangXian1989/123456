Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the current year. Consider maxing this account out if you are in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits and adjust your contributions accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, making them good for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Capital gains and dividends will be taxable, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) or holding assets for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts.
- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before prioritizing investments.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced investment approach across these accounts to manage risk and optimize tax advantages.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
