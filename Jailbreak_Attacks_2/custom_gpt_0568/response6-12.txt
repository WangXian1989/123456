I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common treatment options for liver issues. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding processed foods and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medication**:
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In advanced cases, procedures like liver biopsies or even surgery might be necessary.

4. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and monitoring of liver function tests can help track the progress of the condition.

Always consult your healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your specific situation.
