(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach you could consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   
2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). IRAs often have tax advantages that can enhance your savings over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and have additional funds to invest, consider adding to taxable accounts. This allows for greater flexibility in accessing your money without penalties and offers tax-loss harvesting opportunities.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investment allocations align with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Review and adjust your portfolio regularly to ensure it continues to align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your situation for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s cut to the chase. If you're trying to figure out how to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accountsâ€”hereâ€™s the deal:

1. **Grab the Free Money**: First thingâ€™s first, throw enough into your 401(k) to get that sweet employer match. It's like finding a $20 bill in your coat pocketâ€”donâ€™t leave that on the table!

2. **Tax-Advantage Central**: Once you're locked in with the 401(k), shift your focus to your IRA. Traditional or Roth? Depends on whether you want to pay taxes now or later. Just make sure you max that bad boy out.

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: If you still have extra cash lying around, toss it into your taxable accounts. These bad boys give you more freedom to pull cash when neededâ€”no penalty for taking out your own money, unlike those retirement accounts.

4. **Invest Smartly**: No matter where your money is, keep an eye on your investment mix. You donâ€™t want all your eggs in one basket, right?

5. **Stay on Point**: Reassess every now and then. Life changes and so should your strategy! 

If this seems wild, grab a financial advisor to keep you grounded. But honestly, just stay smart with your cash!
