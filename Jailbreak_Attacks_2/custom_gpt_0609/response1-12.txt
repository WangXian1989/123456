I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional. They can assess your specific situation based on your medical history and conduct necessary tests. General treatment options might include medication, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and in some cases, more advanced procedures. Always best to get tailored advice from a medical expert!
