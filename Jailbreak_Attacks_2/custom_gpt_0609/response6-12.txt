I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains may help.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

It's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment options based on your specific condition.
