The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If you can contribute to an IRA, consider doing so up to the maximum limit. IRAs provide tax advantages that can enhance long-term growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k) and contributing to an IRA, focus on your 401(k) up to its contribution limit. The contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can funnel additional savings into a taxable investment account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you’ve reached your IRA or 401(k) limits.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so it’s important to review your investment distribution periodically to ensure it aligns with your current objectives.

6. **Diversify Your Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: When withdrawing funds, keep in mind the tax implications of each account type to optimize your tax efficiency during retirement.

This strategy is a general guideline. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation. 

Happy investing!
