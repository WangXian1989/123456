To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors such as your current financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some pros and cons of each account type and suggestions for distribution:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   **Pros:**
   - **Employer Match:** Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits:** 401(k) plans have a higher contribution limit compared to IRAs.

   **Cons:**
   - **Limited Investment Choices:** You are often limited to the fund options provided by your employer.
   - **Withdrawal Restrictions:** Early withdrawals typically incur penalties and taxes.

### 2. **IRAs (Individual Retirement Accounts)**
   **Pros:**
   - **Variety of Investment Options:** You can invest in a wide range of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.).
   - **Tax Advantages:** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

   **Cons:**
   - **Lower Contribution Limits:** The contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Income Limits for Roth IRA:** High earners may be ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA directly.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   **Pros:**
   - **Flexibility:** You can withdraw money at any time without penalties.
   - **Variety of Investment Options:** Similar to IRAs, you can invest in a wide range of assets.

   **Cons:**
   - **Tax Liabilities:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes, which can affect your overall returns.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.
2. **Max Out IRA Contribution:** Next, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of its flexibility and wider range of investment options. Prioritize a Roth IRA if your income allows.
3. **Back to 401(k):** After maximizing the IRA, go back to your 401(k) to fill up to the contribution limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Finally, consider investing in taxable accounts for funds that you may need in the short term or for additional flexibility.

### **Conclusion**
The specific percentages to distribute among these accounts depend on your income, tax situation, and retirement goals. It's essential to assess your overall financial picture and possibly consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice. Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your needs and market conditions change.

Happy coding!
