I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. If you suspect you have a liver problem, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some common treatment options that might be recommended, depending on the specific liver condition:

1. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis (like hepatitis B or C).
   - Corticosteroids for conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.
   - Supplements or medications to manage symptoms or improve liver function.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol, which can exacerbate liver damage.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Follow-up blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (like ultrasound or CT scans) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation.
