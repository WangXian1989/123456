Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before putting additional money into an IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Growth is tax-deferred until you withdraw funds, usually in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible based on your income level and participation in other retirement plans. Growth is tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but you can withdraw earnings tax-free in retirement if conditions are met. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can withdraw funds any time without penalties. Gains are taxed as capital gains, typically at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Investment Horizon**: If your investment horizon is long-term (10+ years), tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) may be preferable due to their tax-deferred growth. For shorter-term needs, consider allocating more funds to taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Generally, it’s recommended to hold more tax-efficient investments (like stock index funds) in taxable accounts, while more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds that frequently generate capital gains) can be held in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Flexible Withdrawals**: Keep some liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or unexpected expenses, which can also give you flexibility during retirement.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation, contribution levels, and financial goals. Adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, or tax laws.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan for your specific situation.
