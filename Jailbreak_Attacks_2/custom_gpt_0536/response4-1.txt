Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Contribute to 401(k) Further**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit. This can provide you with tax-deferred growth. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you are in a higher tax bracket now, contributing to tax-deferred accounts like a 401(k) and traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, consider Roth accounts, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. This reduces risk and can improve returns over time.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life events. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
