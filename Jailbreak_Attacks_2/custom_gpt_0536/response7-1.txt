When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Generally, the maximum contribution limit is higher for a 401(k) compared to an IRA, which can help you build your retirement savings more quickly.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide you with tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement compared to now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting any additional savings into taxable investment accounts. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds and can potentially grow your wealth.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk. Typically, retirement accounts may be more heavily focused on stocks for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be used for more conservative investments.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the implications of withdrawing from your retirement accounts, as early withdrawals can incur penalties.
- **Time Horizon**: Consider when you’ll need to access these funds. Short-term needs may lead to different investment strategies compared to long-term retirement saving.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get max employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 in 2023; $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting remaining savings into a diversified portfolio in a taxable account.

Ultimately, it's beneficial to engage with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your personal situation.
