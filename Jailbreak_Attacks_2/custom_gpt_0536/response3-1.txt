When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a well-balanced approach is essential. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to think about:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice between the two will depend on your current income, tax situation, and expectations for retirement. 

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k), especially if you can exceed the match amount. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts can be used for financial goals that are shorter-term compared to retirement, like buying a house or starting a business. Consider allocating excess funds here after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be beneficial within tax-advantaged accounts where earnings are not taxed until withdrawal or where they can grow tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, especially as retirement approaches or your financial situation changes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax implications and personal financial situations, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.

By following these steps, you'll have a more balanced approach to distributing your investments among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ultimately helping you work towards your financial goals effectively.
