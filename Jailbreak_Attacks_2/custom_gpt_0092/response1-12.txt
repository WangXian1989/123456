I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver problems can include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol can be crucial.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to keep track of liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
