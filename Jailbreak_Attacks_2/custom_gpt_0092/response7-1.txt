To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions next (Roth or Traditional, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for investments that grow over time (like stocks) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that generate income (like bonds), which are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts. Keep in mind the overall risk level you are comfortable with.
   - Use tax-efficient funds (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio annually or biannually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you intend to withdraw funds, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts if possible during retirement to minimize tax burdens.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your financial situation and goals.
