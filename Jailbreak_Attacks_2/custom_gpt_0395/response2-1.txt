Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to benefit from tax deferral. Consider if a Roth option is available, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy).

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Use these for more flexible access to funds and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds) to potentially minimize taxes on dividends.

5. **Diversification and Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy based on your specific circumstances can be beneficial.

This approach helps optimize your tax situation while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
