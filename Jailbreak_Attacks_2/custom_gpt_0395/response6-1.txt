Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. Evaluate Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if you can do a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. Tax Implications
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions for long-term growth without immediate tax impact.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or to access funds without penalties. Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains.

### 3. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts. Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly adjust your portfolio to maintain your target allocation.

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- **Drawdown Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes, starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Additional Tips
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor strategies to your personal circumstances.
- **Utilize Tools**: Consider investment tracking tools or apps for monitoring performance.

Making informed decisions can position you for financial success in retirement.
