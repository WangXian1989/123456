When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate the benefits of each type of account. Here's a breakdown to guide you in making informed decisions:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - Often includes employer matching contributions, which can significantly enhance your savings.
     - Tax-deferred growth means you won't pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment choices compared to IRAs and taxable accounts.
     - Early withdrawal penalties (typically before age 59Â½).

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - Broader range of investment options than most 401(k) plans.
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions depending on your income level; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Cons:**
     - Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
     - Early withdrawal penalties may apply, similar to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits or withdrawal restrictions, providing maximum flexibility and liquidity.
     - Capital gains tax rates may be lower than ordinary income rates.
   - **Cons:**
     - Investment income is subject to taxes in the year it's earned (i.e., dividends and interest).
     - Less tax-advantaged compared to retirement accounts.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before directing funds elsewhere.
- **Prioritize Tax Advantages:** Focus on contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA depending on your tax situation after maximizing your 401(k) match.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds Wisely:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth account.
   - Use a taxable account for short-term savings or investments where you want flexibility or need access before retirement age.

### **Final Consideration:**
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, retirement goals, and market conditions.
