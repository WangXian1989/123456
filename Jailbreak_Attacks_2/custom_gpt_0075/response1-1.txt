When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the strategy often depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general principles to consider, along with their pros and cons:

1. **Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match:**
   - **Pros**: Free money through employer matching contributions; tax-deferred growth; high contribution limits.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment options; early withdrawal may incur penalties.

2. **Max out contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA:**
   - **Pros**: Tax advantages (traditional IRAs for tax-deferred growth, Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals in retirement); wider investment options.
   - **Cons**: Lower contribution limits compared to 401(k); income limits may restrict Roth IRA contributions.

3. **After-tax investments in taxable accounts:**
   - **Pros**: Flexibility without penalties for withdrawals; no contribution limits; long-term capital gains rates can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Cons**: Taxable events may occur with dividends and capital gains; no tax advantages like retirement accounts.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Step 1**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (e.g., 4-6% of your income).
- **Step 2**: Max out your IRA contributions (for 2023, that's $6,500 or $7,500 if you're over 50).
- **Step 3**: Go back to your 401(k) and contribute more if you're still under the contribution limits (up to $22,500 or $30,000 if over 50).
- **Step 4**: Any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account for flexibility.

### Key Considerations:
- Analyze your tax situation to maximize tax efficiency.
- Plan for your liquidity needs; keep some cash in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals.
- Regularly re-evaluate your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your unique situation! Happy investing!
