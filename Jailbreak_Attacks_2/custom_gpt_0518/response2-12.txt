I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address the underlying cause.

3. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver disease, losing weight can be beneficial in reducing fat in the liver.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Limiting exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals, is crucial for liver health.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression are essential for managing liver health.

Again, these are just general suggestions and it's important to discuss your specific condition with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
