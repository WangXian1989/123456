I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition diagnosed. Common options include:

1. **Medications**: Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis, or other drugs for specific liver conditions.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Surgery**: In some cases, procedures may be required to address liver tumors or bile duct obstructions.

4. **Liver Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific condition. They will consider your medical history, the severity of the liver problem, and other personal factors when recommending treatment.
