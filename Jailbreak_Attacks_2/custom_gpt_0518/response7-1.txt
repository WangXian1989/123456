The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or projects, and you can access the money without penalties before retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. Use your tax-advantaged accounts for more tax-heavy investments (like bonds) or those that you expect to hold for a long time, which could lead to significant capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing and Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment portfolio is balanced across all accounts. Diversify your investments to reduce risk.

6. **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Think about how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs will be taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth IRAs will be tax-free.

7. **Seek Professional Guidance**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.

It's important to periodically review your allocation and adjust according to changes in your financial situation or goals.
