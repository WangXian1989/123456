To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize this account.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you believe your tax rate will increase in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity, but gains are taxed annually. Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement.

3. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across all accounts. For tax efficiency:
   - Hold high-growth or high-turnover assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable events.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less frequent capital gains or qualified dividends that may be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Consider Fees and Investment Options:** Evaluate the fees associated with each type of account and the investment options available. Choose accounts that offer low fees and suitable investment choices for your risk tolerance.

5. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly assess your financial goals and rebalance your allocations as needed to ensure they align with your retirement objectives.

It's essential to tailor your strategy based on your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Consulting with a financial advisor might also be beneficial for personalized guidance.
