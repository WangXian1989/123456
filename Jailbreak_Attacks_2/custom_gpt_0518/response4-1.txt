Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits which can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might benefit from Roth IRAs (after-tax contributions) rather than traditional ones.

4. **Balance and Diversify**: Have a mix of investments across these accounts appropriate for your risk tolerance. Ensure you're not overly concentrated in any one type of investment.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a taxable account to cover unexpected expenses without incurring penalties or taxes.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type to optimize your investment strategies.

7. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual circumstances.
