To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible, with future withdrawals taxed. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals but require after-tax contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates, especially if held for a year or more.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Maxing out employer matches in your 401(k) is typically advisable before contributing to IRAs.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your timeline and risk tolerance. Long-term growth may favor aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative holdings might be better in taxable accounts to minimize short-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Mixing distributions from these accounts strategically can help manage tax liabilities.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain liquidity for emergencies or unexpected expenses in the taxable accounts before fully investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance across accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

In summary, a suggested approach could be:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA, focusing on a Roth if you qualify, for the tax-free growth benefits.
- Invest any additional savings in a taxable account, considering both growth and tax implications.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances is always recommended.
