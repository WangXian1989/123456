The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you're eligible (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
  
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions may reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, while Roth IRA contributions do not offer an immediate tax deduction but allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts do not provide tax advantages, so be mindful of capital gains taxes when you withdraw funds or sell investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Use tax-deferred accounts for investments that are expected to generate substantial income (like bonds) which could be taxed heavily in a taxable account.
   - Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains) in taxable accounts.

4. **Account for Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If your investment timeline is long, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth without annual taxation.
   - If you expect to need money soon, tax-advantaged accounts have withdrawal rules and penalties that may not align with your needs.

5. **Balance Contributions Based on Goals**: 
   - Allocate your resources based on your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
