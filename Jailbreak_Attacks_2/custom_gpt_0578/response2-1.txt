Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guideline on how to approach this distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. Consider maxing out contributions to either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investing in a taxable account can provide more flexibility regarding withdrawals and a different tax treatment (capital gains tax). Consider holding investments with favorable tax implications (like index funds).

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.). Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon when making these decisions.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Cash Needs**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before allocating money to long-term accounts. Cash needs should be prioritized to avoid penalties or taxes from early withdrawals.

### 5. **Rebalance and Adjust Over Time**
   - Regularly reassess your contributions and asset allocation as your financial goals and situation change. As you get closer to retirement, you may want to shift toward more conservative investments.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k):** 10% of your salary up to the employer match, then 15% max contribution if possible.
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount if eligible (for 2023, $6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for investments after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion:
As everyone's financial situation is unique, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific circumstances. They can help you navigate tax implications and retirement planning more effectively.
