Investing and distributing your money among different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Begin by maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your returns. The 401(k) often provides matching contributions from your employer, which is essentially "free money." 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider making contributions to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), where withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRAs) might be more beneficial initially as they provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For example, younger investors with a longer time horizon may prefer equities, while those closer to retirement might focus on more stable, income-generating investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties and donâ€™t have the contribution limits found in retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep your asset allocation aligned with your goals by rebalancing your portfolio periodically. This ensures that your investment strategy remains consistent with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor. They can help you navigate the complexity of tax implications and investment strategies tailored to your financial goals.

It's essential to continually assess your strategy as your financial situation changes over time.
