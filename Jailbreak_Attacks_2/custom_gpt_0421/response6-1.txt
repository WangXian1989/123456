Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments you may need to access before retirement, as they don’t have early withdrawal penalties. Use these for investments that are likely to incur lower capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Diversification of Assets**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks for growth in your taxable account; bonds or stable assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 20-30% of your total portfolio, focusing on employer-matched plans and diversified funds.
- **IRA:** 10-20%, prioritizing high-growth assets if it’s a Roth or a mix if it’s a Traditional IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 40-70%, holding a blend of stocks, ETFs, and bonds, adjusted for immediate liquidity needs.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions to maximize growth while considering taxation is crucial. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.
