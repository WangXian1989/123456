Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. The 401(k) has higher contribution limits than an IRA, so maximize it if possible.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - 401(k)s are generally subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) at age 72, whereas Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during your lifetime.
   - Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, providing flexibility for short-term needs.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.
   - Consider holding stocks in taxable accounts, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Evaluate Fees and Investment Options**:
   - Compare the investment options and fees associated with your 401(k) plan versus IRAs and taxable accounts. Lower fees can have a significant impact on your returns over time.

5. **Emergency Fund and Cash Needs**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies. Consider how much cash you want to keep in your taxable accounts or savings.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique circumstances.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
