I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver health. Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition, but here are a few common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: A balanced diet low in fat, sugar, and salt can be beneficial. Consider incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), doctors may prescribe specific medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: 
   - Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and health can help manage any issues effectively.

5. **Specialist Consultation**: 
   - Consulting a hepatologist, a liver specialist, can provide tailored treatment options.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for advice specific to your condition and needs.
