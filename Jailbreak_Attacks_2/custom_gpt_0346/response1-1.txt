Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Account**:
   - Once you’ve optimized your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for goals beyond retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to manage risk. Stocks and bonds can be distributed based on your risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind the tax impact when withdrawing funds. Generally, it’s best to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on life changes (like salary increases or job changes) and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
