To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. If you're over 50, take advantage of catch-up contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you're maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but can incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. 

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to stay on track with your investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, seek advice tailored to your individual financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to your investments and optimize your tax efficiency.
