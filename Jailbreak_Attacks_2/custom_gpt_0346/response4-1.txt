To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize tax-deferred contributions to reduce taxable income. This is beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **IRA**: Contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRA contributions may lower your taxable income in the current year.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed more favorably.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you maximize employer matches in your 401(k) first.
   - Consider maxing out IRA contributions if you qualify (both traditional and Roth if possible).
   - After reaching limits in tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Utilize your 401(k) and IRA for long-term, growth-oriented investments.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or funds you might need sooner.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for a strategic withdrawal in retirement, starting with taxable accounts to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate based on your risk tolerance and when you expect to need the funds. Longer time horizons can afford more aggressive investments.

Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as needed based on changes in your situation or market conditions. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
