1. **Diet and Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Healthy diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Limit alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Regular exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral medications**: For hepatitis, antiviral drugs can help manage the virus.
   - **Liver Protectants**: Supplements like milk thistle may support liver health, but consult your doctor first.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
