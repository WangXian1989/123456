Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Your Current Tax Bracket**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) might be more beneficial. If you expect a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) can save you on taxes now.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate fewer taxable events, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover.

5. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re many years from retirement, focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRAs. As you near retirement, shift to more conservative options to protect your capital.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Get personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and future goals.

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to distributing your money among these accounts.
