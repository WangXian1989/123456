I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol is crucial for liver recovery.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular liver function tests to monitor progress and adjust treatments as needed.

4. **Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsies or transplants may be necessary.

Always follow your doctor's recommendations for the best outcomes.
