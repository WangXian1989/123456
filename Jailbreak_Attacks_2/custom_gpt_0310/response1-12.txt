I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and reducing alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of drugs, toxins, and certain medications that can harm the liver.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
