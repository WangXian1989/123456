Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like taxes, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA (if eligible) for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings and liquidity. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** contributions lower your taxable income.
   - Withdrawals from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income.
   - In taxable accounts, capital gains are taxed differently, so consider holding investments long-term.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, and professional advice can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

This structure can help optimize taxes and grow your wealth effectively.
