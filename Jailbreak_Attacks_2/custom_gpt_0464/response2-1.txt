The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: Contribute as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA accounts. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your savings grow more quickly.

2. **Employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

3. **Compare tax rates**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) over taxable accounts.

4. **Diversify contributions**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if eligible) or a taxable account to benefit from potential tax-free growth.

5. **Asset allocation**: Determine how to allocate your investments among accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance, consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts where you won't face taxes until withdrawal.

6. **Withdrawal strategy**: Have a plan for how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, it's favored to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts to prolong tax-advantaged growth.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation.
