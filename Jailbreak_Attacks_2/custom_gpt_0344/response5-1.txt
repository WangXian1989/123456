Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to maximize your employer match, then consider whether to increase contributions based on your tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you may need access to before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds) based on your risk tolerance. Consider placing more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
