To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed to these tax-advantaged accounts first. Aim to take advantage of any employer match in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth. Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds suited to your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Roth or traditional, choose investments that align with your retirement timeline and tax considerations.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize short-term savings or moderate risk investments for flexibility.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications, aiming to draw from the taxable accounts first in retirement to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions based on tax efficiency and your investment goals will optimize your portfolio’s growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Regularly reassess your allocation to ensure it meets your changing needs and market conditions.
