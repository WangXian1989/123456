Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Focus on maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for short-term goals or after-tax growth. Dividends and capital gains can be taxed.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Long-term goals (retirement) should prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - Short-term goals (buying a house, etc.) might be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider how to allocate stocks, bonds, and cash across accounts. Generally, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan which accounts you'll tap first in retirement. Typically, it's advantageous to draw from taxable accounts first for tax efficiency.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Ensure you're maximizing these limits if possible.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your individual financial situation and long-term goals.
