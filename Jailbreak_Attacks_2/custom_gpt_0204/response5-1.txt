To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus on maxing out employer matches first.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Either offers tax advantages. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance and time horizon. A longer timeline might favor riskier, growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals carefully. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity, while tax-advantaged accounts can be more beneficial long-term.

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. Prioritize contributions with employer matches and higher tax benefits.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

A well-rounded approach often involves maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, while using taxable accounts for flexibility and additional long-term investments.
