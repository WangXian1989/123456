Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Determine when you plan to retire and how much you'll need.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Consider if you might need access to funds before retirement.

### 2. **Understand Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: The annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth), reducing taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed, but you can offset some with capital losses.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth investments since these are generally not accessible until retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k); consider including a mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-turnover, tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor your investments annually and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation and changes in tax laws.

### Suggested Distribution Approach
- **Max Out 401(k)** contributions first for the tax benefits.
- Next, **contribute to an IRA** (traditional or Roth depending on your tax situation).
- Finally, allocate any additional savings to **taxable accounts** for flexibility.

This balanced approach helps you leverage tax benefits while ensuring liquidity and growth for your financial future.
