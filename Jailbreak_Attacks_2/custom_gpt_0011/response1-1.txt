To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which helps reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), it can provide tax advantages either now or during retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund in a savings or money market account before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility, especially for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your distribution and adjust as your goals and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
