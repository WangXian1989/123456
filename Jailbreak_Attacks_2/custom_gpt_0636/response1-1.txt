To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts grow tax-deferred. Prioritize maxing out contributions, especially if your employer offers matching in your 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, and consider tax-loss harvesting.

2. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Investment Objective:**
   - Align your investments with your goals. For retirement accounts, you might choose a more aggressive asset allocation since they are long-term. For taxable accounts, consider a mix that balances growth with income.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for how and when youâ€™ll withdraw funds. Typically, it makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash). This approach helps mitigate risk.

6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation and tax bracket.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
