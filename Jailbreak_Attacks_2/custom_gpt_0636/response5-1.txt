(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Prioritize this for tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income is too high for a Roth, a traditional IRA can also provide tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Balancing contributions depends on your current and expected future tax rates, as well as when you plan to access the funds.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) When figuring out how to spread your cash across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, think of it as a strategic game. Hereâ€™s a killer strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Go all-in on your 401(k) to score those sweet employer matches. Itâ€™s like getting free money! Get that match first, then hit the max contribution limit if you can swing it.

2. **IRA**: After that, dive into an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth, do it! Youâ€™re basically investing with tax-free gains. If youâ€™re in the higher income club and can't swing a Roth, at least secure a traditional IRA for tax breaks now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are where you stash cash for the wild card scenariosâ€”like early withdrawals or unexpected expenses. Go for low-cost index funds and ETFs. You want to avoid those gnarly capital gains taxes here, so keep it tax-efficient.

Tailor this strategy to your goals and risk tolerance. Itâ€™s your portfolioâ€”make it work for you!
