In general, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications:**
   - **Diet Change:** Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Weight Management:** Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can alleviate stress on the liver.

2. **Medication:**
   - **Antiviral Treatments:** For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or direct-acting antivirals can be effective.
   - **Liver Support Supplements:** Certain supplements might aid liver function, but these should be discussed with your healthcare provider.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Routine Check-ups:** Regular blood tests and scans to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Advanced Therapies:**
   - **Procedures:** In cases of liver cancer or severe cirrhosis, treatments such as surgery, liver transplantation, or ablation therapy may be necessary.
