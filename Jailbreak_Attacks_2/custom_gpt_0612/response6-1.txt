To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA first. These accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth, which can enhance your overall returns.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for More Liquid Investments:** After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for short-term goals or more liquid investments. This can help with flexibility without incurring penalties for early withdrawals.

### 2. **Investment Growth Potential**
   - **401(k) and IRA for Growth:** Focus on higher-risk investments (like stocks) within these accounts, where you won't pay taxes on capital gains until withdrawal.
   - **Diversify in Taxable Accounts:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate dividend income or interest, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on these earnings annually.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Withdraw from Taxable Accounts First in Retirement:** This can minimize taxes due on your withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts, allowing them to continue growing tax-deferred for a longer period.
   - **Strategically Withdraw from IRAs and 401(k)s:** As you reach retirement age, plan distributions from these accounts to avoid moving into higher tax brackets.

### Summary:
- **Max Out 401(k) and IRA:** Prioritize contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.
- **Liquid Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term needs while keeping tax implications in mind. 

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while managing tax liabilities efficiently. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation and goals.
