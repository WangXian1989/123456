Iâ€™m not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fats and sugars)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis
   - Medications to manage symptoms

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: 
   - Some patients find benefits from herbal supplements, but consult your doctor first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment.
