1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoid alcohol.
   - Follow a balanced diet.
   - Maintain a healthy weight.
   - Engage in regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms and complications.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups to track liver function.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
