Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free.

3. **401(k) Limitations**: After maximizing the employer match and any IRA contributions, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if you’re looking for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Depending on your overall financial strategy and liquidity needs, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Investment Style**: Generally, place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and those expected to generate significant income (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
