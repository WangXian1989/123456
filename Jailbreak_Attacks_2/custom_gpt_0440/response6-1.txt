When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and IRA Contributions:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, which defer taxes until withdrawal, potentially lowering your current taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, where you can manage tax liabilities more actively.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on growth-oriented investments since you'll likely hold these until retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider a mix of growth and income-producing investments to generate cash flow and tax-efficient returns.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**
   - **Maximize Employer Matching:** If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** Try to contribute the maximum limit annually if financially feasible, especially to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### 4. **Risk Tolerance**
   - **Aggressive vs. Conservative:** Adjust your portfolio risk based on your time frame and comfort level, favoring higher-risk assets in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get full employer match, then adjust as needed based on your total investment strategy.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if possible, focusing on growth assets.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for shorter-term goals or specific investment strategies, keeping in mind tax implications.

### Regular Review
- **Rebalance:** Periodically review and rebalance your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

This balanced approach allows for tax efficiency while working toward your long-term financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific circumstances.
