Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages, either tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility but may be taxed differently. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of taxes when withdrawing from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can be helpful.

This balanced approach ensures you make the most of tax advantages while maintaining a diversified portfolio.
