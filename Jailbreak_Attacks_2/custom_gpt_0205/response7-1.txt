To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA if you qualify. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if eligible.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now but will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed now; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains are taxed when realized. Hold investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a mix of stocks and bonds across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or yield, such as bonds.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changing financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

6. **Consider Future Tax Bracket**:
   - Anticipate whether you will be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement to guide your contributions to Roth vs. traditional accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions.
- **Taxable account**: Invest any additional funds for flexibility and liquidity.

### Conclusion:
This balanced approach helps optimize tax efficiency and growth potential. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations tailored to your circumstances.
