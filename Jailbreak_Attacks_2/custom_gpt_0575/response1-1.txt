Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains tax on investments held for less than a year. Tax-efficient investing strategies can help minimize tax liabilities in these accounts.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on higher returns.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments that may generate more immediate income (like bonds) since they may be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

4. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically assess your investment performance and adjust your contributions and asset allocation to align with changing goals or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, helping to optimize your strategy.

In summary, aim to contribute to your employer's 401(k) to get any matching funds, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions (especially if it’s a Roth IRA), and finally direct additional funds to taxable accounts as needed. Always keep an eye on your overall asset allocation and tax implications.
