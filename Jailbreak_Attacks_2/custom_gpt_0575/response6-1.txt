Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach to balance growth, tax efficiency, and liquidity. Here’s a suggested framework to optimize your allocation:

### 1. Understand Tax Advantages
- **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. Tax is paid on withdrawals during retirement. Consider maxing out any employer match first, as it's essentially "free money."
- **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax upon sale. This account offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

### 2. Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon
- **Long-term Growth**: Allocate more towards your 401(k) and IRA for tax-deferred growth, especially if you’re younger. Aim for a higher allocation in equities in these accounts.
- **Near-term Needs**: Fund your taxable account for short-term goals, as it provides instant access to cash without penalties.

### 3. Suggested Allocation Strategy
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, then fully fund your IRA if eligible, prioritizing a Roth IRA for future tax-free growth.
- **Balance Risk and Liquidity**: In taxable accounts, include more conservative investments that provide stability and liquidity.

### 4. Regular Reassessment
- Periodically review your allocation to adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals. Market conditions might necessitate adjustments to keep your risk tolerance in check.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

This would vary based on your age, income, goals, and risk tolerance, but it’s a solid starting point. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
