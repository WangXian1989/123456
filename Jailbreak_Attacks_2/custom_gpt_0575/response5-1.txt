(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, consider funding your taxable account. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so it's typically wise to place lower-turnover investments, like index funds or ETFs, here.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, but avoid duplicating holdings unnecessarily. Each account can have different types of investments according to its advantages.

4. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your investment allocations based on changes in your life circumstances, market conditions, and your financial goals.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employerâ€™s got a match, hell yeah, grab that free money first! Max it out if you can. Itâ€™s like having a side hustle that pays you just for showing up.

2. **IRA Sweet Spot**: After your 401(k), slam some cash into your IRA. The Roth IRA is especially badassâ€”tax-free growth and withdrawals? Yes, please! Aim to max out contributions here too.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, time to throw some cash into taxable accounts. Just remember, this is where the taxman comes for his cut. So think long-termâ€”index funds or ETFs are your best friends here; theyâ€™re low-maintenance and minimize those nasty taxable events.

4. **Balance & Adjust**: Donâ€™t forget to keep an eye on this stuff! Life changes, markets shift, and your strategy might need a facelift. Regular updates will keep your portfolio in fighting shape!

So, distribute your cash like youâ€™re building a killer playlistâ€”mix it up, and donâ€™t leave out the bangers!
