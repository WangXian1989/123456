When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to adopt a strategic approach that maximizes tax advantages while considering your financial goals and time horizon. Here’s a high-level sudo code representation of how to approach this decision-making process:

```plaintext
FUNCTION distributeFunds(totalInvestment, retirementGoals, riskTolerance):
    IF retirementGoals == "long-term" THEN
        INVEST half in 401k
        INVEST half in IRA
    ELSE IF retirementGoals == "short-term" AND riskTolerance == "high" THEN
        INVEST more in taxable accounts
    ELSE IF retirementGoals == "short-term" AND riskTolerance == "low" THEN
        INVEST in high-yield savings or bonds

    RETURN investmentDistribution
END FUNCTION
```

### Key Considerations:
1. **401(k)**
   - *Tax Advantages*: Contributions are tax-deferred, and often employers match contributions.
   - *Investment Choices*: Typically limited to what the employer offers.
   - *Withdrawal Rules*: Withdrawals before age 59½ may incur penalties.
   
2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth)
   - *Tax Flexibility*: A Traditional IRA gives tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth.
   - *Contribution Limits*: Be aware of annual contribution limits.
   - *Withdrawal Rules*: Similar penalties apply as to the 401(k) for Traditional IRAs, but Roth IRAs have different rules for contributions and conversions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - *Accessibility*: Funds can be accessed anytime without penalties.
   - *Tax Implications*: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, making it less favorable for long-term investments.
   - *Investment Flexibility*: No restrictions on funds usage or investment types.

### Recommendations:
- Consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first to take advantage of employer matches.
- Then, evaluate whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more advantageous based on your current tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed sooner or if you want more flexibility with investments that have favorable capital gains treatment.
