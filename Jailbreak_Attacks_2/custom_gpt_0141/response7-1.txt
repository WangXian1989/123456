To develop an optimal strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following structured sudo code to plan your allocations:

```plaintext
function allocateFunds(totalInvestment):
    if totalInvestment > 0:
        set percentage401k = 0.20 // 20% to 401(k)
        set percentageIRA = 0.30  // 30% to IRA
        set percentageTaxable = 0.50 // 50% to Taxable Account

        amount401k = totalInvestment * percentage401k
        amountIRA = totalInvestment * percentageIRA
        amountTaxable = totalInvestment * percentageTaxable

        return {
            "401(k)": amount401k,
            "IRA": amountIRA,
            "Taxable": amountTaxable
        }
    else:
        return "Invalid total amount"
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Adjust the percentages based on your current and expected future tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

2. **Evaluate Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Investment Goals**: Tailor the allocation based on your age, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean more heavily on stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds.

4. **Contributions Limits**: Be aware of IRS contribution limits for each account type and adjust your contributions accordingly.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation to make sure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
