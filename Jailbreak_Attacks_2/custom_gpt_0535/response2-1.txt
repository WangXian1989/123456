Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth and possibly employer-match contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Account**: Offers more flexibility for withdrawals but comes with capital gains tax on earnings and dividends.

2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Determine whether your primary goal is retirement savings, short-term investing, or a mix. Long-term investments may lean more towards 401(k) and IRA, while short-term may benefit from taxable accounts.

3. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - If eligible, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, especially if it is a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

4. **Strategize Withdrawals**:
   - Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future. This can help preserve your tax-advantaged accounts for longer.

5. **Balance Risk and Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks are typically more suitable for long-term accounts, while bonds and cash-equivalents might be better for shorter-term needs.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation across accounts and adjust as necessary based on market performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifting goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping you to optimize your allocations for tax efficiency and growth.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
