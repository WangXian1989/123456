To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Treatment**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Roth)**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold, and dividends may also be taxed.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For example, in 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older). 

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider your long-term financial goals and how quickly you need access to the funds. Retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) are generally for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can offer more flexibility for short-term needs.

4. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is effectively "free money."

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match if available.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, prioritize maxing out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and future income expectations.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After fully funding your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional growth and flexibility.

### Regular Review and Rebalancing:
Regularly review your allocations and rebalance your investments based on market performance, changes in your financial goals, and life circumstances.

##### Note:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation, as individual circumstances can greatly influence the best approach.
