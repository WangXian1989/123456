Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if feasible, as 401(k) plans offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be advantageous.
   - If you choose a traditional IRA, you'll get a tax deduction upfront, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Keep emergency funds and short-term savings in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity without penalties.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50% of your total contributions, focusing on employer match and tax deferral.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 30% of contributions, optimizing for tax benefits based on income levels.
- **Taxable Account**: 20% of your contributions, prioritizing emergency savings and investments with favorable tax treatment.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific circumstances and to adjust as your situation evolves over time.
