The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with matching contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions in the contribution year.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income for the year, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Taxable accounts have different tax implications; you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they provide more flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts. This may include equities, bonds, and other assets. Different account types can hold different investment strategies that align with your risk tolerance.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep money in accessible accounts for emergencies. Typically, this would be outside of retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, plan a strategic withdrawal strategy that minimizes taxes based on the type of accounts you have.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual's financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture.

Evaluate your financial situation regularly and adjust your contributions as needed to align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
