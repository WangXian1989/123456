The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a 401(k), prioritize contributions here after getting the match. Choose a mix of stocks and bonds that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA is great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since your withdrawals will be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or stocks, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes to manage risk.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio allocation and make adjustments based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
