Generally, a good strategy might involve maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer matches a portion, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Any additional savings can then be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals but do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. It's always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy suited to your specific needs.
