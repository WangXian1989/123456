To provide the best advice on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on realized gains, dividends, and interest. This account offers more flexibility for withdrawals but lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term financial goals. If you're investing for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you're saving for a home or other near-term goals, consider taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if you can, as they often have annual limits. 

4. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline**:
   - Younger investors may prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability and income.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Aim to diversify your investments across all accounts for balanced growth and risk management.

A general strategy could be:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any matching contributions first.
- Maximize IRA contributions next, placing funds into a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- Any additional savings can go into a taxable account for flexibility and additional investment opportunities.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized distribution strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.
