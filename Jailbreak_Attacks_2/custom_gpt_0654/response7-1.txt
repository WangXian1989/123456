To optimize your investments, consider the following allocation strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Maxing out these accounts can significantly impact your long-term growth due to tax deferrals and potential employer matches in the 401(k).

2. **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose a diversified portfolio.

3. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and retirement goals, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred growth) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Contribute to this account after maximizing the employer match in your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, distribute additional funds to taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility and liquidity, although you will be responsible for capital gains taxes on investment income and if you sell.

5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and timeline. Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio periodically to make adjustments based on performance and changing financial goals.

Remember to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
