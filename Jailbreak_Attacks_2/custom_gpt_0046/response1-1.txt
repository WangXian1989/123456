Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing this out if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth. Choose based on whether you prefer tax savings now or later.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use these for investments you might need to access sooner. They offer more flexibility but less tax efficiency.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for stocks expected to appreciate significantly, benefiting from lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific situation.
