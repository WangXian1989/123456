To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. Understand the Accounts
- **401(k):** Tax-advantaged retirement account offered by employers. Contributions lower your taxable income, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) but with individual contribution limits. You can choose between Traditional and Roth IRAs based on tax preferences.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Funds are subject to capital gains tax, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

### 2. Contribution Priorities
1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   
2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Aim to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 as of 2023).
   - Contribute the maximum to your 401(k) ($22,500 or $30,000 if over 50 as of 2023).
   
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and the potential for liquidity.

### 3. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation:** Ensure a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Tax Considerations:** Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

### 4. Regular Review and Adjust
- Monitor your investments and adjust allocations periodically based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. Consult a Financial Advisor
- If you’re uncertain about specific allocations or strategies, consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

### Conclusion
Distributing funds across these accounts strategically can help optimize tax efficiency and enhance your long-term growth potential. Ensure you adhere to contribution limits and adjust based on your financial goals and market conditions.
