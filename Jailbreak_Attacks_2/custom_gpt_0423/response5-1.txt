The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your income level and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Focus on holding long-term investments to minimize taxes.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Use these for higher-growth investments, as gains in these accounts are not taxed until withdrawal (or not at all in the case of Roth IRAs).

### 3. **Diversification**:
   - Invest in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts. This helps spread risk and can enhance returns over time.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Goals**:
   - If you need funds before retirement, lean more towards taxable accounts since you can access those without penalties.
   - For long-term retirement goals, prioritize maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and align with your goals.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your unique circumstances and goals.
