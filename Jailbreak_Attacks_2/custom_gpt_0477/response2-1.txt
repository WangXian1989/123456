Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider for each account type:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Index Funds/Target-Date Funds:** Consider low-cost index funds or target-date funds that align with your retirement timeline.

2. **IRA:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide based on your current versus expected future tax rate. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversified Investments:** Similar to a 401(k), focus on a diverse mix of assets such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Use tax-efficient investment strategies such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Revenue Generation:** This account can be useful for generating income through dividends or interest, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions to receive the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA, favoring a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
- Use any remaining funds for your taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Tax Implications:** Consider the tax implications of each account type when making withdrawals.
- **Regular Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
