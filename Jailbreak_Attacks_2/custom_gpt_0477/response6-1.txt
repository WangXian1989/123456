Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts wisely can optimize your investment and tax strategy. Here are some considerations to help you make this decision:

### 1. Tax Considerations
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, and you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs future tax rate. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in them for flexibility and access, but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize tax liabilities.

### 2. Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance
   - **Long-term Growth:** If your goal is long-term growth and retirement funding, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) as they allow for more compounding over time without tax drag.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** If you need access to funds before retirement, use taxable accounts where you can withdraw without penalties.

### Strategy Recommendation
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Direct enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match before moving on.
- **Build an Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts.
- **Diversify Across Account Types:** Aim to have a mix of tax-advantaged and taxable accounts to maintain flexibility and control in retirement.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that matches your unique financial situation and goals.
