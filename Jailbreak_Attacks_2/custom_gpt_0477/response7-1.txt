Distributing your money among different types of accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Invest in Your 401(k)**: Beyond the employer match, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if it offers good investment options and low fees. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investment. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Make sure your asset allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Consider the tax implications of different investments, as short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term gains.

6. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund and consider paying off high-interest debt, as these can often yield better returns than investments.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation is always a wise decision.
