Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match—that’s free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s, and try to max out if possible, especially if you are in your peak earning years.
   - **Investment Options**: Check the available investment options and fees associated with your employer's plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement will be taxed. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure to understand the contribution limits for IRAs, and consider contributing to a Roth if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts offer more flexibility and liquidity since you can access the funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Growth**: Keep in mind that capital gains taxes will apply on profits, so consider tax-efficient investing strategies.

### General Strategy:
- **Diversify**: Consider diversifying your investments across all three types of accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Prioritize Accounts**: Many financial advisors suggest focusing on getting the full employer match in your 401(k) first, then funding an IRA, and finally contributing to a taxable account.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Utilize tax-deferred accounts for higher-growth investments and consider placing income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

It's usually beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
