The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically involves a strategic blend of tax efficiency, your retirement timeline, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation). A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue to Fund Your 401(k):** After reaching the IRA contribution limit, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if it's a traditional plan that offers tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxation:** For taxable accounts, focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains) and consider using tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains distributions.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure your investments in all accounts are diversified and aligned with your overall risk tolerance and timeline for needing the money.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts at regular intervals to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Remember, personal circumstances vary widely, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy suited to your specific financial situation and goals.
