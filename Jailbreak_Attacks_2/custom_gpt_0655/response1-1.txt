The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are often tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. This might include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Emergency Fund First:** Before heavily investing, make sure to have an emergency fund built up in a liquid account.

5. **Long-Term Strategy:** Consider your retirement timeline and liquidity needs. 401(k) and IRAs are typically for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can provide access to cash for other needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
