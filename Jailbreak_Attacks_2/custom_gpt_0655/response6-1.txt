To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Benefits:** Often come with employer matching contributions, maximizing your investment potential.
   - **Considerations:** Check for high fees and investment options available. Prioritize maxing out any match offered by your employer first.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Benefits of Traditional IRA:** Contributions can be tax-deductible, which can reduce taxable income.
   - **Benefits of Roth IRA:** Tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Strategy:** Consider how much you can contribute for the year; ideally max out if you can.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Benefits:** Greater flexibility for withdrawals and investments; no contribution limits.
   - **Considerations:** Investment income and capital gains are taxed annually, so it's crucial to choose investments that generate favorable tax outcomes, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize Contributions:**
  - Max out your 401(k) up to the employer match.
  - Contribute to your IRA, deciding between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
  - Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

- **Review and Adjust:**
  - Regularly review your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal financial goals.
  - Rebalance yearly to maintain your desired distribution across these accounts.

This approach maximizes tax advantages while ensuring you have liquidity for immediate needs through taxable accounts.
