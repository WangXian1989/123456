Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions if you're eligible, as these accounts typically offer tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (like a Traditional IRA or 401(k)) to reduce your taxable income. If you're in a lower bracket or expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified but remain aligned with your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Adjust for Liquid Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for liquidity needs or short-term goals, since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.
