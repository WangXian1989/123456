The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, and especially if they match contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Typically, maxing out your employer's match should be your first priority.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax deductions depending on your income, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, depending on eligibility. Choose based on your current and expected future tax brackets.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of access but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification:** Regardless of account types, diversify your investments across asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and possibly real estate to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy efficiently, considering tax implications for each account type during retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy based on your individual situation can be very beneficial.
