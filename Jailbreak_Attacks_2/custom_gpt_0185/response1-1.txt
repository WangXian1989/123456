Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any company match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum if you're in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After your 401(k), consider maxing out an IRA. Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts; holding investments long-term can minimize taxes.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.
