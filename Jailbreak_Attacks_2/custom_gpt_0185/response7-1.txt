Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts offer tax benefits, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts because of their potential for tax savings.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months’ expenses) before investing heavily.

### 4. **Retirement Goals**
   - If you’re far from retirement, you might focus more on growth through equities in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As retirement approaches, gradually shift to more conservative investments (bonds, fixed income).

### 5. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits (e.g., for 401(k) and IRA) and try to contribute the maximum if possible.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio within each account type. Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 7. **Withdrawal Plans**
   - Think about your withdrawal strategies in retirement:
     - Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.
     - 401(k) and IRA withdrawals can be taxed, so plan for tax implications.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible, focusing either on Traditional or Roth depending on your tax bracket.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

### Conclusion
Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
