Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it offers tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on higher-growth investments here since you won’t pay taxes on the growth until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize for investments that generate lower taxable events (e.g., index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax burden.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Opt for a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy can apply, with an emphasis on long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using ETFs or stocks for capital gains. Keep an eye on taxes, particularly for interest income and dividends.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a separate liquid emergency fund before overly investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review performance and contributions to optimize your allocation as your financial goals and market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailored advice can consider your specific situation and help you navigate complex tax implications.

Diversifying your investment strategy across these accounts can help balance risk and tax efficiency.
