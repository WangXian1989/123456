Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively can optimize your tax benefits and retirement savings. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**:
   - After IRAs, if you still have capacity, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (the limit for 2023 is $22,500 or $30,000 if over 50).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These are beneficial for short-term goals and flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (to minimize taxes on growth) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and adjust as needed.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing funds, particularly from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, as these withdrawals are usually taxed as ordinary income.

Regularly evaluate your situation and consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs and goals.
