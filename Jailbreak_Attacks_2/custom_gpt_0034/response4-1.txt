To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Invest in Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to your IRA. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Fund taxable accounts with excess savings. These accounts provide flexibility but may be taxed on interest, dividends, and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Reserve higher-growth assets for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Maintain your desired allocation across accounts. Monitor performance and make adjustments as necessary.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Plan for your tax situation in retirement. Distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxable, while Roth accounts may not be.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can tailor strategies based on your specific situation and goals. 

This approach will help optimize your savings and tax efficiency.
