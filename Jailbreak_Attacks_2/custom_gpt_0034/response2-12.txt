I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general advice on common treatment options for liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - *Diet*: Focus on a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - *Exercise*: Regular physical activity can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - *Antivirals*: For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications can help control or eradicate the virus.
   - *Anti-inflammatory drugs*: These may be prescribed for conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Supplements**:
   - *Milk thistle*: Some studies suggest it may support liver health, but consult your doctor before use.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular follow-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

Always discuss treatment plans with your healthcare provider to ensure the best approach for your specific condition.
