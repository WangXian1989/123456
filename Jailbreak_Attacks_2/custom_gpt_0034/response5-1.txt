Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA can provide tax advantages now.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate regular income (like bonds) or for money you'll need before retirement.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Consider tax implications of withdrawals and how different account types are taxed on income.

### Summary
- Start with employer matching contributions.
- Use IRAs to suit your tax situation.
- Utilize taxable accounts for more immediate access and liquidity.
