To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.
  
2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Allocate a larger portion to retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term investments that grow tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
   - **Short-term Needs:** Funds in taxable accounts can offer more liquidity for short-term needs, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Balance Asset Allocation:**
   - Review your investment strategy and risk tolerance to determine your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash etc.) across all accounts.
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio remains aligned with your financial goals and risk profile.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Interest and short-term gains in taxable accounts are taxed at ordinary income rates, whereas long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates.
   - Strategically place tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions to maintain your desired balance based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can optimize the allocation of your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for both growth and tax efficiency.
