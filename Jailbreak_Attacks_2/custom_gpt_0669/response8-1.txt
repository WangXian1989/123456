When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general guide on how to allocate your funds:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match for 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be a great option for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial.
   - **401(k) Contributions:** After securing the employer match, consider maxing out your contributions to the 401(k) if your financial situation allows for it. The contribution limit is generally higher than that for IRAs.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you’ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide greater flexibility as you can withdraw your contributions at any time without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - In taxable accounts, you may want to focus on investments that have favorable tax treatments, like municipal bonds or qualified dividends.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Monitor your asset allocation and performance regularly. Life events (like marriage or buying a home) and market fluctuations can impact your strategy, so it’s essential to rebalance your portfolio as needed to stay aligned with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider speaking with a financial advisor to get personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.

This structured approach helps ensure you are making the most of your contributions while preparing for future financial security.
