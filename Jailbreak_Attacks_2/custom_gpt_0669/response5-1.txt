(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: Depending on your eligibility, contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA can provide tax advantages. If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, consider a Roth IRA.

3. **Allocate Remaining Funds**: After maximizing your contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Risk**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified and match your risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down, shall we? Distributing your dough among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is like crafting the perfect pizza â€“ you want the right balance of toppings (or in this case, investments) to hit that sweet spot. Hereâ€™s the skinny:

1. **411 on the 401(k)**: Start by maxing out that employer match. It's like finding money on the street; you would be nuts not to pick it up. Get rich off that free cash first!

2. **IRA Insight**: Depending on your current and future tax situation, think about slapping your money in a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. If you think taxes are gonna bite you harder later, better go for the Roth. Itâ€™s tax-free growth time, baby!

3. **Get Taxable**: Once youâ€™ve hit the caps on your 401(k) and IRA, throw your extra cash into a taxable account. It's your freedom fund. You wonâ€™t get penalized for taking cash out, but yeah, watch out for Uncle Sam when you sell stuff in there â€“ capital gains can be a pain.

4. **Mix It Up**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket or whatever that saying is. Diversify across these accounts based on your risk appetite. You want to sleep well at night, after all.

Definitely consider giving a financial advisor a shout if you wanna get super specific with your strategy, â€˜cause everyoneâ€™s got a unique vibe going on!
