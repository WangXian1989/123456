The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions to these accounts are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, funding a Roth IRA can be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be used for short-term goals and are subject to capital gains taxes. They offer flexibility, but you may face tax implications from selling investments.

3. **Establish an Emergency Fund:**
   - Before heavily investing in your retirement accounts, ensure you have enough savings set aside for emergencies, typically covering 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor your investments and financial goals regularly. Rebalance your portfolios as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Use Tax Loss Harvesting:**
   - In taxable accounts, consider harvesting losses to offset gains and lower your tax burden.

A common strategy for many investors could be:

- Fund your 401(k) to at least the match level.
- Max out your Roth IRA if eligible, considering your tax bracket.
- Allocate additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity, while continuing to contribute to your 401(k).

Ultimately, the right approach for you may require consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your specific situation.
