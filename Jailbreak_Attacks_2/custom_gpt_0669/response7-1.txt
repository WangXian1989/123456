When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play. Here's a general strategy to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After securing the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k):** Once you've contributed to your IRA, continue putting money into your 401(k) until you've reached the contribution limit. In 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can be directed to taxable investment accounts. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility because you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, although you'll pay taxes on the capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance across all accounts. You may want to diversify your investments differently based on the account's tax implications (e.g., place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-producing investments in taxable accounts).

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review your allocation to ensure that it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Life changes, market performance, and other factors can warrant adjustments.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
