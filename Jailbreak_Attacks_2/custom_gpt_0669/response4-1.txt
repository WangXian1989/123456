When considering the best way to distribute your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should take into account several factors including tax implications, investment goals, and your individual financial situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, but you will owe taxes upon withdrawal.
   - A Roth IRA involves paying taxes now, but offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Depending on your goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.), you may prioritize different accounts. For long-term growth, utilize tax-advantaged accounts; for shorter-term needs, consider using taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Make sure to diversify across all accounts to spread risk, avoiding concentration in one area.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance if necessary to ensure you are adhering to your investment strategy and risk tolerance.
