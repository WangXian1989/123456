To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (up to the annual limit) to reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is beneficial for short-term goals and gives access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically house more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) since gains are tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments (like ETFs or index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**: Plan for retirement income needs and potential tax brackets after withdrawal.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific goals and tax situation.
