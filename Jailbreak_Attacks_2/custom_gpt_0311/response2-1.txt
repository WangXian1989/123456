Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax bracket, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA next. Consider your current tax rate versus expected retirement tax rate:
     - **Traditional IRA:** Pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth. Good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** After-tax contributions, but tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Good if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These offer flexible access to funds and capital gains treatment on long-term holdings.

### 4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify investments across accounts to balance risk. Consider asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance:
     - **Aggressive:** More stocks (higher risk).
     - **Moderate:** Balanced mix of stocks and bonds.
     - **Conservative:** More bonds and stable investments.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automated contributions to ensure consistent investing, maximizing dollar-cost averaging benefits.

### 6. **Yearly Review and Adjustments**
   - Review your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes, adjusting as necessary for market performance or changes in goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for your financial future.
