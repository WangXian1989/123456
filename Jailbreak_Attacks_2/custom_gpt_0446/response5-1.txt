When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to align your strategy with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there's a match. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account. 401(k)s and traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts can be beneficial for more flexible access to funds but may incur capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Different accounts might be suitable for varying types of investments. You could hold more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while placing more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Having a mix allows for strategic withdrawals that tap into each account type based on tax implications and your spending needs.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an adequate emergency fund in cash or high-yield savings outside these accounts to prevent penalties from early withdrawals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
