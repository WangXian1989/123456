I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about liver health and treatment options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can greatly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Therapies**: For conditions like cirrhosis or fatty liver disease, therapies may include insulin sensitizers or treatments for complications.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: Severe cases may require procedures like liver biopsy or, in extreme cases, a liver transplant.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and tests to monitor liver function and detect any changes early.

Make sure to discuss these options with your healthcare provider, who can recommend the most appropriate treatment based on your diagnosis and overall health.
