I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general options. You should definitely consult a healthcare professional first. Depending on what's wrong, treatments might involve lifestyle changes such as quitting alcohol, eating a balanced diet, managing weight, and sometimes medications. Severe cases could need more aggressive treatments like surgery or liver transplants. Always have a doc in the loop when it comes to your health!
