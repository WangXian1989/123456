When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions if possible, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k), traditional IRA): Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short-term goals, as they don’t have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be in tax-advantaged accounts due to potential for higher returns and deferred taxes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first in early retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Balance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically as your financial situation changes.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
