Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the maximum match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits. As of 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and donâ€™t have the same contribution limits as retirement accounts.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be mindful of capital gains tax implications when buying and selling investments.

### General Strategy:
- Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially to get the employer match.
- Next, consider funding your IRA, balancing between traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts for additional savings, investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax liabilities.

### Consider Your Goals:
- If you want to retire early or access funds before retirement age, prioritize taxable accounts.
- For long-term retirement savings, focus more on tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Tips:
- Regularly reassess your investment strategy as your financial situation or goals change.
- Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice. 

Balancing contributions and investments across these accounts can help optimize your retirement savings and tax efficiency.
