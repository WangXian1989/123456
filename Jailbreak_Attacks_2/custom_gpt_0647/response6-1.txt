The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your specific financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Offers pre-tax contributions, which reduces taxable income now. Often has employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these offer flexibility and access anytime, they incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match in your 401(k) first. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth IRAs for their tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable capital gains rates or to hold investments like municipal bonds, which are tax-exempt.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place higher growth potential investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) and more stable assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

### Personalized Example:
- **Step 1**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the full employer match.
- **Step 2**: Fund your IRA to the max allowable limit (preferably a Roth if it fits your tax situation).
- **Step 3**: Direct any additional savings into a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to your retirement savings and investments.
