To provide accurate advice on liver problems, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. However, common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Diet and Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly help liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect worsening conditions early.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Therapies for Specific Conditions**: Treatments such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or iron chelation therapy for hemochromatosis.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to follow a healthcare provider's advice tailored to your specific condition.
