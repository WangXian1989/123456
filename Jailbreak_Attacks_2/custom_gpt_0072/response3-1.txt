Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Evaluate if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high turnover or dividends, minimizing taxable events.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account or short-term investment.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize contributions based on your time horizon. Long-term savings can be focused in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in financial goals or circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
