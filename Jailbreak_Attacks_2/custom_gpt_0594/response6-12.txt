I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** 
   - Adopting a healthy diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications:** 
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions (like antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring:** 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and size.

4. **Surgery:** 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Please consult your healthcare provider to discuss the most suitable options for your situation.
