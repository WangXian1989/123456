Sure! To provide tailored advice on distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I'll need to gather some information first. 

1. **What are your financial goals?** (e.g., retirement savings, buying a home, fund education, etc.)
2. **What is your risk tolerance?** (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive)
3. **What age are you planning to retire?** 
4. **Do you have any existing contributions in these accounts?** 
5. **Are there any particular assets or investments you are interested in?**

Gathering this information will help create a strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances and goals! Let me know how you would like to proceed!
