To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often offers employer matching, pre-tax contributions, and potential tax-deferred growth. Prioritize this if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for flexibility and liquidity; however, you'll pay taxes on capital gains and dividends, so consider this when investing.

2. **Maximize Contributions:**
   Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as these accounts often have tax advantages.

3. **Diversification Strategy:** 
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a Roth IRA) and lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawals.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies in your taxable accounts to offset gains.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages:**
   As you approach retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments, focusing on preserving capital and generating income.

6. **Regular Review:**
   Periodically assess your allocation and make adjustments based on market conditions, your personal financial situation, and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
