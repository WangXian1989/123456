The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Contribute to your traditional or Roth IRA, considering income limits and tax implications. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide you with tax deductions now.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in a taxable account.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** (401(k), traditional IRA) are great for reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts:** (Roth IRA) grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free, making them appealing if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep investments that may incur short-term capital gains or high taxes on dividends here, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) or actively managed funds.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk. Different accounts may hold varying asset allocations based on their tax implications.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you will draw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts as needed.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your investments and rebalance as necessary to adhere to your target asset allocation.

Ultimately, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specifically for your situation, considering all factors, including your risk tolerance, retirement timeline, and financial goals.
