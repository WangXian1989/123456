Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some general principles:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth Accounts**: Decide between traditional and Roth IRAs based on your expected tax situation in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth might be better. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, a traditional IRA could save you money now.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains. High-growth assets can be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio within these accounts, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk profile.

5. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Always ensure that you're considering your own financial goals and situation when making these decisions.
