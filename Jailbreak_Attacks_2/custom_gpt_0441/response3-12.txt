I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options usually depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Some common approaches might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoiding alcohol.
   - Eating a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), antiviral or other specific medications might be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek advice from a healthcare provider for personalized treatment plans.
