Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for long-term growth. These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, which can be advantageous.

   - **401(k)**: Consider this if you have high contribution limits and matching.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund in a savings account before investing heavily.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income or for funds you may need before retirement. Theyâ€™re also good for certain investments like municipal bonds, which are often tax-exempt.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments across all accounts for risk management. Typically, you might want higher-risk assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-risk assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be strategic in which investments you hold in each account. For example, hold high-growth stocks in a tax-deferred account and income-generating investments in a taxable account to minimize tax impact.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations and make adjustments based on performance and changes in your life circumstances or goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
