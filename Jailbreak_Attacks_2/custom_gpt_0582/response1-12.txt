1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (reduce alcohol intake, eat a balanced diet)
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight

2. **Medications**: 
   - Specific medications may be prescribed depending on the cause of liver dysfunction (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, surgical interventions or liver transplants may be considered.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Frequent check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

Always reach out to a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
