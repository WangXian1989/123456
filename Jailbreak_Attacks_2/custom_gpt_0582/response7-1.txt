Investing your money wisely across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach that takes into account your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how to optimally distribute your funds among these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize this account first. Contribute enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
    - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income. If you have a Roth 401(k) option, contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
    - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Similarly, contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars. Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be tax-free.
    - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. You'll pay capital gains tax on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account, keeping in mind the different tax implications for each account type.

4. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Goals**:
    - If your goal is long-term growth, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRA) before contributing to a taxable account.
    - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), you may want to prioritize a taxable account to avoid penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and the performance of your investments regularly. Rebalance your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the best strategy will depend on your individual financial situation, including your income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment timeline. Consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can also be beneficial.

If you're looking for specific numbers or percentages for distribution, it would be prudent to assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon to create a tailor-made strategy.

Consider these factors, and you should be able to come up with an efficient allocation that caters to your financial situation.
