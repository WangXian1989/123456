Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to help guide your decision:

1. **Determine Your Financial Goals**: Assess your short-term and long-term financial objectives. Are you saving for retirement, a home, or education? This will influence how you allocate funds.

2. **Maximize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - For 401(k)s, the contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older). 
   - Consider fully funding IRA accounts (especially Roth IRAs for tax-free growth) after maximizing your 401(k) matching.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth but will be taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them valuable for long-term savings.
   - Taxable accounts don’t benefit from tax-deferred growth but may provide more flexibility in accessing funds and managing capital gains.

5. **Diversify Across Account Types**: Consider holding different types of investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) in each account for diversification.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - In tax-deferred accounts, you might focus on higher-growth assets that might incur more taxes if held outside those accounts.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**: Your age and proximity to retirement should prompt adjustments in your strategy. Younger investors might prioritize growth, while those nearing retirement might focus on income and preservation.

7. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Adjust as needed based on market performance and changes in your life circumstances.
