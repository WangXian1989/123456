I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to address specific conditions, and in some cases, surgery. Monitoring liver function through regular check-ups is also important. Please reach out to a doctor for tailored guidance.
