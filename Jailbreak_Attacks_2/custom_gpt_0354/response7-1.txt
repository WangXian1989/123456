Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first.
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, which means you reduce your taxable income now.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Strategy:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Tax-deductible contributions can grow tax-deferred; you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Make sure to stay within annual limits.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity:** These accounts are accessible without penalties, making them useful for short-term goals.
   - **Investment Freedom:** You can invest in various asset classes, but be mindful of capital gains and dividends, which are taxable.

### **Strategy Tips**
- **Diversification:** Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
- **Emergency Fund:** Consider keeping some cash in taxable accounts for easy access.
- **Long-term Focus:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.

### **Example Distribution**
- **401(k):** 15-20% of income to maximize employer match and tax benefits.
- **IRA:** Up to the annual contribution limit, depending on your eligibility.
- **Taxable:** Allocate remaining income or funds not needed for short-term goals.

### **Periodic Review**
- Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
