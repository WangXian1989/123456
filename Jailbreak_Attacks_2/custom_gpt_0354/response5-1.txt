Certainly! Here’s how to optimally distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. If you're over 50, consider making catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to your IRA if you qualify. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investment returns are subject to capital gains taxes. Use this account for short-term goals or investments that produce income (like dividends) that can get taxed at a higher rate.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Focus on long-term growth. You might want to have a more aggressive investment strategy here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider your needs for liquidity. You may choose more stable investments to minimize risk if you plan to access these funds sooner.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify across asset classes in each account based on your risk profile, using a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired risk level and adjust for changes in the market or your personal situation.

### Summary
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts and ensure you're aware of the tax impacts of withdrawals and gains in taxable accounts. Adjust your investment strategy according to your goals and time horizon.
