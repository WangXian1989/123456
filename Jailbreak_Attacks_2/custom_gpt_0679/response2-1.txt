To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now. Consider your current tax bracket and expected future income to choose the best option.

3. **Finish 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your employer match and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds into taxable accounts for more flexible access to your money. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets to effectively spread risk.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing or selling assets from your taxable accounts. Hold investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs and financial situation.
