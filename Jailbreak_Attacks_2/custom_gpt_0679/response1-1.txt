When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you'll want to consider several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Maxing out these accounts can help you save on taxes, as contributions to traditional accounts are typically tax-deductible, and Roth accounts grow tax-free.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within your accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio that suits your risk tolerance and time horizon. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Money in taxable accounts isn't tax-deferred, so be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments. Balancing investments across accounts can help manage your overall tax liability.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquidity outside these accounts for emergencies before committing a large amount to long-term investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as your financial situation, goals, or tax laws change.

For specific advice tailored to your unique situation, itâ€™s always a good idea to consult a financial advisor. They can provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
