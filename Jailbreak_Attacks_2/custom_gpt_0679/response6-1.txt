Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering tax implications, liquidity needs, and overall financial goals. Here are some guidelines to optimize your distribution:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically, invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds for long-term growth. These accounts benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

3. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon and Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize higher-risk investments in tax-deferred accounts for long-term compounding.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: For funds you may need sooner, maintain them in taxable accounts to ensure liquidity.

In summary, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, maintain tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, and carefully consider your individual financial circumstances to craft the most effective distribution strategy.
