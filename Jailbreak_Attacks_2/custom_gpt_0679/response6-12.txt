   - Increase intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Avoid alcohol and substances that can further damage the liver.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise.

4. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan.
