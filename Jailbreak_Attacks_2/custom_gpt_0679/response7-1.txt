The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, especially with a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Maximize contributions up to the limit if possible, as these contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), any additional savings can be directed toward taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but do not provide the same tax benefits.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Generally, invest in higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and keep lower-growth, income-generating assets in taxable accounts to mitigate tax impacts.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Adjust asset allocation based on your financial goals and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts based on performance and changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored plan that fits your specific situation.
