I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's very important to consult a healthcare professional or a liver specialist for the best treatment options for your specific condition. They can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and the severity of your liver issue.

In general, some common treatment options for liver issues might include lifestyle changes, medication, and in severe cases, surgery. Here are some general points:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Following a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can help improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes of liver problems.
3. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and condition may be necessary.
4. **Surgery**: In cases of severe damage, such as cirrhosis or liver tumors, surgery or a liver transplant might be considered.

Again, please seek the advice of a healthcare professional for a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
