The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to get any employer match first.
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions:** Offers tax deferral. Consider maximizing this if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the limits for each type of account.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity:** Useful for short-term goals or if you need quick access to your funds.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **General Strategy**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments or taxable bonds.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Conclusion
Aim to maximize tax-advantaged accounts first while keeping some liquidity in taxable accounts. Adjust based on your changing financial situation and goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
