I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet, low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol Avoidance**: Stop or limit alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver biopsy, or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

4. **Supplementation**: Some may benefit from vitamins or supplements, but consult a healthcare professional first.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver health.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your specific condition.
