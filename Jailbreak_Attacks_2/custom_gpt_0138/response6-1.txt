Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-term needs**: Allocate more towards taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matches.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Choose based on your tax situation; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates.

### 3. **Diversification Strategies**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds, considering your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Consider including some higher-risk assets for growth, especially if it's a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments with favorable tax treatment, like index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of IRS limits for contributions to maximize tax benefits.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations annually based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: 50% (utilizing employer match)
- **IRA**: 30% (preferably Roth if eligible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% (for flexibility and liquidity)

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
