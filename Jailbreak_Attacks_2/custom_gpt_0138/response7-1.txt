To optimally distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Max out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which grows tax-free.
   - Continue contributing to your 401(k) after the match, prioritizing it for its tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.
   - Consider holding bonds or high-turnover funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target allocation.

5. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on your long-term goals and risk tolerance when making investment choices.
