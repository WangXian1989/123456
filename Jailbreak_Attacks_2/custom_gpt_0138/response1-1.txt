To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for high-income earners.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Roth vs. Traditional), contributions can be tax-free or tax-deductible. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing any additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Keep track of capital gains for tax purposes.

3. **Investment Mix**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate significant taxable income (like bonds), since you can defer taxes.
   - Keep stocks in taxable accounts for long-term capital gains tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**: Balance your investments across all accounts to minimize risk and ensure consistent growth.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
