To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Tax Situation**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Identify your retirement age and income needs.
   - **Current Tax Bracket**: Understand how your contributions will affect your tax liability.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on eligibility and tax benefits.

### 3. **Prioritize Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: 2023 limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: 2023 limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Keep a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep some liquid savings for emergencies; you'll have more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio annually to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts can optimize your savings for retirement while considering taxes and future accessibility. Make adjustments as your financial situation evolves.
