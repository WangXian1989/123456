The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before wide distribution.

3. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - After obtaining the employer match, continue contributing to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Focus on maxing out contributions if you can.

4. **IRA Contributions:**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawal benefits, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

5. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for flexibility. Invest excess funds here after maximizing retirement accounts. These might be useful for mid-term goals since you can access them without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Ultimately, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
