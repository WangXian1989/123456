Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold and regular income tax on dividends and interest.

### 3. **Assess Your Retirement Timeline**
   - If retirement is many years away, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - If retirement is closer, consider how distributions will impact your income taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across these accounts. Keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor a distribution plan based on your specific financial situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out your contributions for employer match and basic retirement savings.
- **IRA**: Contribute max allowable, particularly to a Roth IRA if you qualify for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term goals or additional investments once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, focusing on tax efficiency and time horizon, will generally yield the best results.
