Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, start by contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts First:** Contribute to your tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) up to the contribution limit if your goal is to reduce your taxable income. This is especially beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

3. **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before making aggressive contributions, as this provides financial security in case of unexpected expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, consider allocating some money to a taxable account for its liquidity. Capital gains tax applies here, but there's no penalty for early withdrawal like in retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Roth Options:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). Contributions are made after taxes, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which could be advantageous later in retirement.

6. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, look at how investments are allocated (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and rebalance your investments periodically to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk profile.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure or want personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide tailored recommendations based on your unique situation.

Itâ€™s important to adapt these strategies to fit your individual circumstances, including age, income, goals, and risk tolerance.
