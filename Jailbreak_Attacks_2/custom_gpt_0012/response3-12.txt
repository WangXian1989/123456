I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and weight management can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases (e.g., liver tumors), surgical options may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
