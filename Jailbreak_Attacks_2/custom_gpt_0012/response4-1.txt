Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**
   - **If offered by your employer**, maximize contributions, especially to get any company match.
   - Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **Consider Roth IRA Contributions**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. This allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - The maximum contribution limits and income phase-out ranges will apply.

### 3. **Fund a Traditional IRA**
   - If you’re not eligible for a Roth IRA or have maxed out your contributions, a traditional IRA is a good option.
   - Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and if you have access to a retirement plan.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for extra savings.
   - They provide more flexible withdrawal options and no contribution limits.

### 5. **Optimize Asset Location**
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

### 6. **Diversify and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts.
   - Rebalance to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Professional guidance can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

These steps can help optimize your investment strategy and maximize long-term growth potential.
