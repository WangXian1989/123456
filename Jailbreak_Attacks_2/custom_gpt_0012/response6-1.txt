Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategic considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Immediate Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term investments or goals. They can provide greater flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Often have a range of mutual funds and stocks; focus on diversified, low-cost index funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, like ETFs, to minimize tax burdens.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**
   - Split investments among accounts based on your risk tolerance:
     - More aggressive in retirement accounts (long-term).
     - Conservative in taxable accounts if you plan to use the funds soon.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly review asset allocation and adjust based on performance, life changes, or market conditions.

### Conclusion
A thoughtful distribution strategy aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance while optimizing for tax efficiency. Aim for a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of each account type.
