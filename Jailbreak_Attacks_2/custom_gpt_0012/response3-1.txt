Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: If you can, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that provide more flexibility. These can include stocks or mutual funds you might need access to before retirement.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Factor in the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, while contributions to traditional accounts can reduce taxable income now.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing goals.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
