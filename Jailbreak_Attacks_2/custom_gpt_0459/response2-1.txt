When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to maximize any employer match in your 401(k), as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, post-tax contributions. 
   - Taxable accounts do not offer tax deductions, but capital gains can be managed more flexibly.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Utilize your 401(k) for long-term growth investments and potential employer contributions.
   - Use your IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation.

4. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure that you have sufficient liquid savings in your taxable account or savings account for unexpected expenses before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors may benefit from higher risk tolerance and investment in equities, while those nearing retirement should consider more conservative allocations.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor the performance of your investments across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your overall investment strategy and goals.

Remember to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
