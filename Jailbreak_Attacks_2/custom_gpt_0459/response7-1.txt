The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Taxable accounts may be ideal for investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, as these are usually taxed at a lower rate.
   - Place higher-interest investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts where they won't be taxed annually.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocations as needed to maintain your target strategy over time and adapt to any changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances and help optimize your retirement funding strategy.

By following these general principles, you can work towards a balanced and tax-efficient approach to your investments.
