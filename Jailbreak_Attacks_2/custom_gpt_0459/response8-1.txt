When considering the best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your tax situation, retirement goals, investment options, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach:

1. **Contribute to the 401(k) Up to the Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed enough to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate any additional funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and access to your money without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Generally, itâ€™s beneficial to hold bonds and cash in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) and IRAs) to avoid high taxes on interest income. Stocks, which can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates, may be better suited for taxable accounts.

5. **Review Your Investment Strategy**: Make sure your overall investment strategy is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance. Revisit your allocations regularly to adjust for market conditions and life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Remember, personal financial situations can vary significantly, so consider your individual circumstances when making decisions.
