When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the maximum contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of the match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.

4. **Investment Options**: Evaluate the investment options available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited options, while IRAs often provide more flexibility in choosing investments.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Consider your need for accessible cash. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity without penalties, while retirement accounts may impose penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversify your assets to minimize risk.

7. **Retirement Timeline**: Your age and when you plan to retire can influence how you allocate funds. If you are younger, you may opt for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

8. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation as you age and adjust contributions as necessary based on your financial situation and market conditions.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy based on your individual circumstances and goals.
