Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Max out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties and may be subject to lower capital gains taxes depending on your income and holding period.

3. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk. Consider factors such as asset allocation and investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance to minimize taxes during retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue to grow.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
