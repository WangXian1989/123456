It's great that you're thinking about managing your investments! While I mainly focus on TypeScript and coding support, I can provide some general principles regarding investment allocation.

When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal, which is useful for long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions can be tax-deferred (traditional IRA) or tax-free (Roth IRA, if eligible).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments generate capital gains tax upon selling. This is important to consider for your more liquid investments.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define short-term vs. long-term goals. You might want to take more risks with long-term investments in retirement accounts due to their tax advantages.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider what types of investments are best suited for each account. For instance, bonds may be better kept in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on interest.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Understand the contribution limits for each account type. Maxing out employer matches in your 401(k) is often recommended first before contributing to an IRA.

5. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you maintain sufficient liquidity for short-term needs; taxable accounts can provide faster access to funds without penalties.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across your accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Once you've assessed these factors, you can create a tailored investment strategy that aligns your financial goals with your current needs. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance specific to your situation.

Remember to regularly review your allocation as market conditions and your personal circumstances change!

Happy investing!
