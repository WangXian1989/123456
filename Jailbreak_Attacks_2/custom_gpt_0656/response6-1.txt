The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly affect your long-term growth.

### 2. Strategic Asset Allocation:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Focus on growth investments like stocks. These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, as they incur fewer taxes due to lower turnover rates. You might also hold bonds here, as they are taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 3. Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy:
   - **Retirement Withdrawals:** Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impacts; for instance, drawing from taxable accounts first can allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 4. Regularly Reassess Your Allocation:
   - **Periodic Review:** Adjust your asset distribution based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances. Regular reassessment helps ensure that your strategy aligns with your current situation.

### Conclusion:
Creating a plan that takes maximum advantage of tax benefits, while also maintaining flexibility through taxable accounts, will lead to a more robust investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
