(α) Targeting young voters effectively involves a mix of strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviors. Firstly, leverage social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat where young people are most active. Creating engaging and relatable content that resonates with their interests can be impactful. Additionally, using influencers and peer ambassadors can help in building trust and connection. 

Another key strategy is to address issues that matter most to young voters, such as climate change, education affordability, and social justice. Engaging in grassroots campaigns and providing opportunities for direct involvement, such as volunteering or attending events, can also encourage participation. Lastly, simplifying the voting process with clear information on how to register, where to vote, and why their vote matters can significantly increase turnout.
