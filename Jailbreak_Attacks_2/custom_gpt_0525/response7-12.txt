I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on treatment options for liver problems. The best approach usually depends on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some common treatment strategies:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can help. Consider a Mediterranean diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help with weight management and liver health.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: If alcohol is a contributing factor, quitting can significantly improve your liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-Up**:
   - Regular monitoring of liver function through blood tests can help track the progress of high liver enzyme levels and assess treatment efficacy.

4. **Treatment of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Addressing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, or viral infections can improve liver health.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases or for conditions like liver cancer, procedures such as liver resection or transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
