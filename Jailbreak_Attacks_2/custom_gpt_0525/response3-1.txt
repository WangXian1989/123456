To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are usually pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Invest aggressively here, considering employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth on qualified withdrawals. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize annual tax liability from capital gains.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate funds based on your short-term and long-term goals. Longer time horizons can justify riskier investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to spread risk.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your employer match in your 401(k) first, then fund your IRA to its limit, and lastly, use taxable accounts for additional savings.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for withdrawal phases, as tax implications can vary between accounts. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation annually to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.
