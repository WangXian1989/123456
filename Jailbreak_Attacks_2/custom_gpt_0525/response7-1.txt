To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Factors to consider include retirement plans, home purchases, education, and emergency funds.

### 2. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs offer tax advantages, either tax-deductible contributions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to capital gains tax on profits. Ideal for shorter-term goals or funds you might need before retirement.

### 3. Maximize Employer Match
If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to maximize this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 4. Prioritize Tax Efficiency
- **401(k)**: Focus on this if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it allows for tax-deferred growth.
- **Roth IRA**: This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Account**: For funds you might need before retirement or if you have excess savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. Diversification
Diversify your investments across all accounts to reduce risk. Consider different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate.

### 6. Regular Contributions
Set up regular contributions to each account, adjusting as needed based on changes in income or financial goals.

### 7. Review and Adjust
Regularly review your investments and contributions, adjusting for changes in market conditions and your personal circumstances.

### Example Strategy
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to take full advantage of any employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if eligible and appropriate for your tax situation.
- Anything beyond these limits can be allocated to a taxable account.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
