The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose to contribute to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax). If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are often taxed at lower rates. Consider holding high-growth stocks or ETFs here.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place your bonds and other interest-generating securities in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes on interest income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation is diversified across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

5. **Liquid Funds**: Keep some cash readily available in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs.

6. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and adjust your investments accordingly to maximize tax benefits.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.
