To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received. Long-term capital gains have favorable tax rates compared to ordinary income.

2. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Focus on tax-sheltered accounts (401(k) or IRA) for growth early on, as your investments can grow tax-deferred.
   - Consider having a mix of taxable accounts for liquidity needs or short-term goals, as you can access these without penalties.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable account. This is essentially free money.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term savings and emergency funds, and focus on retirement accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified, balancing risk across different asset classes.

6. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type (e.g., for 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500; for IRAs, it's $6,500, with catch-up contributions available for those over 50).

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to the employer match.
- **Roth IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible, focusing on tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account**: Use any additional savings for a taxable account, prioritizing investments with favorable tax treatments (like index funds or ETFs).

### Rebalancing:
Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance, tax laws, and changes in your financial situation. 

### Consult with a Financial Advisor:
Consider seeking advice from a financial planner to tailor your investment strategy based on personal goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial situation.
