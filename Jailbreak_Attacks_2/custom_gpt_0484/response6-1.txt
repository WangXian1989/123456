To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limit**: Since 401(k) plans allow for larger contributions than IRAs, prioritize funding this account up to the maximum annual limit if your employer matches contributions.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from tax deductions or tax-free withdrawals, respectively. Choose based on your current and expected future tax situation.
   - **Diversification of Tax Benefits**: Contributing to both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA (if eligible) can provide flexibility in retirement regarding withdrawals and tax management.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: These accounts can be more beneficial for short-term financial goals or emergencies since they allow withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### Key Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your contributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes to balance risk and return across all accounts.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize growth while managing your tax implications effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
