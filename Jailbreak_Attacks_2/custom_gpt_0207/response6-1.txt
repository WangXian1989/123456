To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
- **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

### 2. Tax Efficiency
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) and prioritize long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Growth Assets (Stocks):** Place these in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
- **Income-Producing Assets (Bonds):** Consider placing these in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified interest.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly
- Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk profile and asset allocation.

### Implementation Steps
- **Calculate Contributions:** Aim to meet contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs.
- **Select Investments:** Choose investment vehicles that align with your risk tolerance and goals.
- **Review Annually:** Reassess your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

By strategically distributing your investments, you can enhance growth while minimizing tax impacts.
