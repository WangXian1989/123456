To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax treatment. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are received, and capital gains are taxed when investments are sold.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term versus long-term goals. If you need the funds in the near future, you might prefer taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Max out employer matches in your 401(k) before contributing to other accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts which have specific withdrawal rules.

5. **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**:
   - Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs require RMDs starting at age 72. Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during the owner's lifetime, which can influence where to hold more of your funds.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out employer match in your 401(k)**: This is essentially free money.
- **Contribute to a Roth IRA** (if eligible): This can provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Fill up your Traditional IRA**: If youâ€™re looking for tax-deferred growth.
- **Invest in a Taxable Account**: Use this for funds you might need before retirement or for specific goals.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 20-30% of your total retirement savings.
- Roth IRA: 15-20%.
- Traditional IRA: 15-20%.
- Taxable Account: 30-50%.

### Regular Review:
- Life situations and tax laws change, so regularly review your allocation based on your financial situation and goals.
