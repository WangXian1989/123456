To optimize your investment strategy, consider the following guidelines for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to get any employer match, as itâ€™s effectively free money.
   - If your employer offers a Roth option, consider your tax situation to decide between traditional or Roth contributions.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you anticipate needing immediate tax deductions, contribute to a traditional IRA, but keep in mind the income limits for deductibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings goals that are shorter-term (e.g., buying a house, travel).
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains with losses.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a balanced investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Typical diversifications include stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.
   - Adjust asset allocation based on the account type. For example, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts because the tax impact of withdrawals is delayed until retirement.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Monitor your allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your target asset allocation and adjust for changes in income or retirement goals.

By strategically balancing your contributions across these accounts and considering tax implications, you can enhance your overall investment growth while maintaining tax efficiency. If you want to dive deeper or tailor this to your specific situation, feel free to ask!
