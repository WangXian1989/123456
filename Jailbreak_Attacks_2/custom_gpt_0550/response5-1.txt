Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. If possible, maximize your contributions to take full advantage of the annual limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. The choice between a Traditional and a Roth IRA depends on your current tax situation and future expectations (Roth IRAs are generally better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later).

2. **Balance Between Accounts**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, focusing on investments that benefit from tax deferral (like stocks).
   - Keep more conservative or bond-focused investments in your taxable accounts, as they can generate interest income that’s taxed at your ordinary income tax rate.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts. Holding onto investments longer can help reduce the tax impact.
   - Tax-loss harvesting strategies can also be useful in reducing taxable income.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**: 
   - If your situation is complex, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

This strategy can help ensure you’re setting yourself up for both short-term and long-term financial success while minimizing your tax burden.
