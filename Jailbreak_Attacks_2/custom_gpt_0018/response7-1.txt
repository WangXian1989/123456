It's great that you're thinking about your investment strategy! Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help optimize growth, manage taxes, and achieve your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a concise approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, if your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA (traditional or Roth) before investing too heavily in taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are generally $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with additional catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance when determining how to allocate assets. A mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments should be tailored based on your age, goals, and risk profile. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

5. **Utilize Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs, which typically generate fewer capital gains and can minimize your tax burden.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your investment distribution and asset allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual circumstances is also a good move. They can help you navigate specific tax implications and investment opportunities.
