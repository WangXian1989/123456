ðŸ’° The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if contributions are tax-deductible. Might be better for your tax situation if you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Any investments here will be subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold, which can be efficient if managed properly, especially for long-term investments.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that the investments within each account are well-diversified, which can decrease risk and improve potential returns over time.

4. **Investment Goals**: Align your investment choices with your time horizon and goals. For example, if retirement is many years away, consider a more aggressive strategy in your 401(k) and IRA, while maintaining more conservative allocations in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

5. **Withdrawals & Required Minimum Distributions**: Keep in mind that starting at age 72, you will need to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA, but not from a Roth IRA. This might influence how you want to allocate your investments.

6. **Flexibility**: Having some funds in taxable accounts can provide flexibility for expenses that arise before retirement or for other financial goals.
