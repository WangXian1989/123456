I'm not a medical professional, but it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice on liver issues. Common treatments for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, high-fiber foods)
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight

2. **Medications**:
   - Anti-inflammatory drugs for conditions like hepatitis
   - Diuretics for fluid retention

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups and liver function tests

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treatment for diabetes, high cholesterol, or alcohol dependency, if applicable

Always seek professional medical guidance to determine the best course of action for your specific condition.
