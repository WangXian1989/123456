Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be crucial for your overall financial strategy. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k):** This is often a great starting point because of employer matching contributions. If your employer matches, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Additionally, 401(k) plans typically allow for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing the match in your 401(k), you may want to focus on your IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial as your contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, the Roth option could be particularly advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™re contributing adequately to your 401(k) and IRA, consider allocating funds to a taxable account. This is particularly useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals. Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy:**
- Start with maximizing any 401(k) employer match.
- Next, contribute to an IRA (preferably a Roth if eligible).
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings, diversification, and liquidity.

It's also wise to assess your overall financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance when allocating your investments. Consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized insights tailored to your unique circumstances.
