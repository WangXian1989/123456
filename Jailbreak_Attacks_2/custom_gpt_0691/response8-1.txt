The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can provide a strong foundation for your retirement savings.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement and flexibility. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions depending on your income and participation in other retirement plans.

3. **Contribute the Annual Limit to Retirement Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your employer match and making IRA contributions, consider contributing to the maximum allowed in your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and over).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you are maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility and access to funds if you need them before retirement, but be mindful of taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your time horizon and financial objectives.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time, so it's essential to regularly review your accounts and adjust your contributions as necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have specific financial goals or complex situations, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.

Keep in mind to factor in your current tax situation, potential future income, and when you plan to access the money. This strategy will help you maximize your retirement savings while minimizing your tax burden.
