To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and often contributions are matched by your employer. Higher contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also tax-advantaged, but with lower contribution limits compared to 401(k). Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No special tax advantages, but you have the flexibility to withdraw anytime without penalties. Capital gains taxes apply upon selling investments.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine if your focus is on retirement savings, short-term liquidity, or long-term investments. Your investment strategy may differ based on your timeline and goals.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure to stay within the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize their benefits (for the tax year 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA, with catch-up contributions available for individuals 50 or older).

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for long-term growth. Consider filling up lower tax brackets in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance across all accounts. You might want to place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounded growth, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

6. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable account to cover any short-term needs or emergencies, as withdrawing from retirement accounts before retirement age can incur penalties.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy and allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

By carefully evaluating these factors, you can develop a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
