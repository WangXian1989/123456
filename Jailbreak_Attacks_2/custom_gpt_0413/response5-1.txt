Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA because they provide tax benefits. Depending on whether your income qualifies, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing in your taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility, especially if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement age.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of how distributions from your accounts could affect your tax bracket in retirement. Goal alignment with future income levels will influence where to stash your cash.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and market outlook.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor is always advisable to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.
