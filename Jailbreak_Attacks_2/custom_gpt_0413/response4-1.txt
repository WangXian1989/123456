Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax and can grow tax-deferred, making it beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional IRA (pre-tax, tax-deferred) or Roth IRA (post-tax, tax-free withdrawals), consider your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are good for investments you might need to access before retirement, but be aware of capital gains taxes.

3. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: If you might need access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to taxable accounts or a Roth IRA, where contributions can be withdrawn without penalty.

4. **Diverse Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a balanced portfolio across all accounts. This might mean different investments in each account based on tax efficiency and your risk tolerance.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, and plan your contributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also help optimize your distribution strategy based on your unique circumstances.
