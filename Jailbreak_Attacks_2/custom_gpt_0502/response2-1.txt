Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Focus on long-term growth for retirement funds.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to within 5 years.

### 2. **Account Types**
   - **401(k)**:
     - **Pros**: Employer matching, tax-deferred growth.
     - **Cons**: Limited investment options, penalties for early withdrawal.
     - **Strategy**: Maximize employer match, contribute the maximum allowed if possible.

   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Pros**: More investment options, tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).
     - **Cons**: Contribution limits and potential penalties for early withdrawals.
     - **Strategy**: Contribute up to the limit, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - **Pros**: No contribution limits, ability to withdraw anytime without penalties.
     - **Cons**: Capital gains taxes on profit.
     - **Strategy**: Invest in tax-efficient funds and consider tax-loss harvesting.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - Place higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep lower-growth or dividend-paying investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Reassess your allocations yearly based on performance, goals, and changing circumstances (job changes, market conditions).

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match + a portion of your salary (e.g., 10-15%).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed (e.g., $6,500 if under 50; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds based on risk tolerance and liquidity needs.

### Conclusion
The best allocation strategy varies by individual circumstances, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation and goals.
