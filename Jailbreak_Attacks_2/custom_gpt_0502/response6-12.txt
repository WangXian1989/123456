To provide the best treatment options for your liver problem, itâ€™s essential to know more about your specific condition. Here are some questions to consider:

1. **What is your diagnosis?** (e.g., fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis)
2. **What symptoms are you experiencing?** (e.g., jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain)
3. **Have you received any treatments or medications so far?**
4. **Do you have any other health conditions?** (e.g., diabetes, alcohol use)
5. **What lifestyle changes have you made?** (e.g., diet, exercise)
