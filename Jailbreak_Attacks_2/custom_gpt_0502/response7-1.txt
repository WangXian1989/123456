Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy and tax benefits. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing out your contribution limit if it fits your budget.

### 2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on income and whether you have access to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of contribution limits and eligibility based on income levels.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Provides the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. It's useful for medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Youâ€™ll owe capital gains tax on any profits when selling investments. Prioritize tax-efficient investments (e.g., ETFs, index funds).

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize Contributions:** Start with maximizing your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA (considering taxes) and finally fund your taxable accounts.
2. **Tax Efficiency:** Place higher-growth and higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes, while keeping more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.
3. **Age and Goals Consideration:** Tailor your distribution based on your age and retirement goals. Younger investors may benefit from more aggressive growth, while those closer to retirement may prioritize stability.

### **Sample Distribution Approach:**
- **401(k):** 50% of total contributions (maximize employer match)
- **IRA (Roth/Traditional):** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

### **Regular Review:**
Reevaluate your contributions and asset allocation annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

### **Consider Professional Advice:**
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored insights based on your unique situation.
