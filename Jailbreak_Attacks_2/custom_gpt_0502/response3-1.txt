Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Utilize pre-tax contributions for tax benefits, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on long-term growth.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Rebalance and Adjust**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on market performance and life changes (age, marital status, etc.).

| Account Type      | Priority Level            | Contribution Strategy                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 401(k)            | High (especially for match)| Max out to the employer match first                   |
| IRA/Roth IRA      | Medium                    | Max out contributions based on eligibility             |
| Taxable Accounts   | Low (post-tax advantage)  | Invest any remaining funds after maxing other accounts |

### Additional Considerations
- Assess your current income tax bracket and potential future changes.
- Keep track of your overall asset allocation across all accounts.
- Consult with a financial advisor for personalized investment strategies tailored to your specific situation.
