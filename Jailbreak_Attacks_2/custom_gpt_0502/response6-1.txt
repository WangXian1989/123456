To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits and employer matching. Contributions are tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and liquidity, but gains are subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Establish Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easy access.
   - **Mid to Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

### 3. **Balancing Contributions**
   - **Max out the 401(k)**: Especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on eligibility, a Roth IRA can be advantageous for tax-free growth.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last**: Use them for investments not suitable for retirement accounts, like real estate or specific stocks.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Use all accounts to diversify your portfolio (stocks, bonds, ETFs).

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts**: Use gains from taxable accounts to offset taxes due on other investment income.
   - **Consider Future Tax Bracket**: Contributions to Traditional IRAs may reduce current taxable income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Annually review your distribution strategy based on changes in salary, expenses, and market conditions.

By aligning your financial distribution with your retirement goals, tax implications, and asset allocation needs, you can optimize your investment strategy effectively.
