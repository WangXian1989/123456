Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Fund Your 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach its contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for added flexibility, especially if you want access to funds before retirement age.

5. **Evaluate Tax Efficiency**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and re-balance as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy from these accounts to minimize your tax burden.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
