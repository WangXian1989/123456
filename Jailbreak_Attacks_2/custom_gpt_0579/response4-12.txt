I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a medical professional for liver problems. They can offer tailored advice based on your specific condition. Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight management, and avoiding alcohol. Depending on the severity of the problem, medications or procedures may also be necessary. Please seek medical advice for your situation.
