Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timeline for needing the funds. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer-Sponsored Plans (401(k))**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and an excellent return on investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've maxed out the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Use the 401(k) and IRA for tax-deferred growth. Traditional accounts provide tax benefits upfront, while Roth accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Invest in taxable accounts for flexible access to your money. These accounts allow you to withdraw funds at any time without penalties. They can be beneficial if you plan to withdraw funds before retirement or want to have access to cash for shorter-term needs.

4. **Diversification**: Within each type of account, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust the allocation in each account to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If you're far from retirement, you may choose to take on more risk (higher stock allocation). As you approach retirement, shifting to more conservative investments (bonds, cash) can help preserve capital.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific financial situation.
