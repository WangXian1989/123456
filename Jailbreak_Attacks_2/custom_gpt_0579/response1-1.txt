The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Contributions**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income. In contrast, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Withdrawals**: Understand how withdrawals will be taxed. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth withdrawals (if conditions are met) are tax-free.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each type of account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Balance Your Portfolio**:
   - Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation strategy. This may involve shifting funds between accounts, especially if one account grows significantly faster than others.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you are young and have decades until retirement, you might prioritize aggressive growth in taxable accounts. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more stable investments.

6. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your need for access to funds. Taxable accounts generally have more liquidity than retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Account Type Matters**: 
   - Different account types are suitable for different purposes. For example, use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds and retirement accounts for long-term goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It might be beneficial to consult with a financial planner to tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.

By considering all these factors, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals.
