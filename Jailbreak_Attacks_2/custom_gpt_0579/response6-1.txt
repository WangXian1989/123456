When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic options:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits either now or in retirement.
   - **Allocate to taxable accounts last:** These accounts are typically less tax-efficient due to capital gains taxes on investments.

### 2. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on a mix of mutual funds or target-date funds. Often these accounts come with employer matches, so maximize contributions to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your tax situation, aim for a balance of stocks and bonds. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in assets with favorable tax treatment. For instance, focus on long-term investments that will incur lower capital gains tax rates.

### Recommendations: 
- **Contribution Strategy:** Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions before returning to your 401(k).
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

In conclusion, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, diversify your investments across all account types, and regularly reassess your strategy as your financial situation changes. Make sure to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
