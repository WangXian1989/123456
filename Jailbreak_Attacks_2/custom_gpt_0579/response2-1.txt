Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to the maximum limit if you can, as this account grows tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) after maximizing your 401(k) match. 
   - A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - If you're eligible, you can contribute to both a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts can be useful for money you may need in the short to medium term, as they offer flexibility with withdrawals and have no contribution limits.
   - It's also a good place to hold investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Be strategic about where you hold certain types of investments. For instance, bonds or high-yield investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while stocks may be more advantageous in taxable accounts due to the favorable long-term capital gains tax rate.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
