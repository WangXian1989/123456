When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; then max out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k), contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends. Consider low-turnover index funds for tax efficiency.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more tax-efficient assets or bonds to minimize taxes on distributions.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), IRA), and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA) as needed.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations and tax implications annually.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation.
