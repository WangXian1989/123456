Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be optimized for your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement planning. Here's a structured approach to consider:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income in the present.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These have no tax advantages, but allow for flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):
   - **Contribute enough to your 401(k)** to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Recommendation**: Aim for at least enough to hit the match limit before contributing to other accounts.

### 3. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **After maximizing the 401(k) match,** consider maxing out contributions to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your current tax situation).
   - **Strategize based on income**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

### 4. Allocate Remaining Funds:
   - **Once both tax-advantaged accounts are maximized**, focus on your taxable account for additional savings.
   - **Invest for growth**: Choose investments with favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

### 5. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **Utilize tax-loss harvesting** in taxable accounts to offset gains.
   - **Rebalance your portfolio** regularly to maintain your desired risk level and financial goals.

### Conclusion:
By prioritizing contributions in this manner, you can enhance your savings while optimizing for long-term growth and tax efficiency. Tailor your strategy as necessary to fit your unique financial landscape.
