When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the investment choices available within your 401(k) and choose low-cost index funds or a target-date fund if you're unsure.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
   - **Tax Advantages**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 or older as of 2023).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Strategic Allocation:
- **Short-term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for needs within 1-5 years.
- **Medium-term Goals**: Consider a mix of taxable accounts and IRAs.
- **Long-term Goals**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax advantages and growth potential.

### General Tip:
A common strategy is to prioritize maxing out contributions in your 401(k) to the employer match, followed by your IRA contributions, and finally, any remaining funds can be allocated to taxable accounts. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.
