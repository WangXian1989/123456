(Î±) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your overall financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, particularly if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Diversification**: Distribute your investments in a way that balances tax implications. Use tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) for investments that generate higher taxable income, such as bonds or REITs. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in your taxable accounts.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**: If you plan on withdrawing funds before retirement, keep this in mind for your taxable accounts, as they may allow more flexibility without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

It's recommended to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
