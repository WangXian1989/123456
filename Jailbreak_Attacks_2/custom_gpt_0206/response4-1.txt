The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to 401(k) regarding tax treatment.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed yearly on capital gains and dividends.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Short-term needs**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility without penalties.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match before contributing to other accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match.

2. **Contribute to Roth or Traditional IRA**:
   - Prioritize based on current tax situation and future expectations.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments.

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k)**: Up to the company match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contribution limit.
3. **Taxable**: Any remaining funds.
