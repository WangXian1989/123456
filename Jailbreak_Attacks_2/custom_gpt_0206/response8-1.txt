Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contributions Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if age 50+).
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit (e.g., $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if age 50+).

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, helping to lower your tax bill.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for investments you'll need to access before retirement; consider capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner who can tailor a strategy for your specific circumstances.

By considering these points, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
