   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and disease progression.
