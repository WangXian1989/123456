Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—it’s free money!

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in a high-yield savings account or similar for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals with shorter time horizons or for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to balance risk.

6. **Reassessment**: Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions, your age, and retirement timeline.
