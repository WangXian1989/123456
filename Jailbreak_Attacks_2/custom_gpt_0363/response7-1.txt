Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, timeline, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA, especially if it offers tax deductions or other benefits. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you qualify.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts. These offer flexibility for withdrawals and capital gains.

4. **Consider Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your goals. For long-term growth, consider equities; for stability, consider bonds.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, and hold lower-growth investments in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
