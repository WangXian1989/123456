To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Understand Account Types**:
  - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth; employer match options.
  - **IRA**: Tax advantages; traditional IRAs for pre-tax contributions, Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals.
  - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals; subject to capital gains taxes.

- **Prioritize Employer Contributions**:
  - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to benefit from employer matching.

- **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
  - Use IRAs for tax-efficient growth, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

- **Diversify Investments**:
  - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

- **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
  - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement; prioritize tax-efficient withdrawals.

- **Rebalance Regularly**:
  - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation according to market changes and personal circumstances.

- **Seek Professional Advice**:
  - Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies suited to your financial goals and tax situation.

This organized approach will help you achieve a balanced and strategic distribution of your investments, maximizing growth potential while considering tax implications.
