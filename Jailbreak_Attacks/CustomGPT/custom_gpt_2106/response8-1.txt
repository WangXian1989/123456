To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Contributions**:
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
  - Max out contributions to your IRA, especially if it offers tax benefits.
  
- **Understand Tax Implications**:
  - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate ordinary income to minimize taxes.
  - Consider placing higher-growth investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains taxes.

- **Diversify Investments**:
  - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk.
  - Assess the investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to ensure balanced exposure.

- **Age and Time Horizon**:
  - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize max funding tax-advantaged accounts.
  - If funds are needed in the short term, keep more liquid assets in your taxable accounts.

- **Withdrawal Strategy**:
  - Plan for orderly withdrawals from accounts based on tax implications.
  - Use taxable accounts first if you're in a low tax bracket, then tap into tax-deferred accounts as needed.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
  - Tailor your strategy to your unique financial situation and goals.
  
Summarizing your distribution strategy can lead to optimized growth while managing tax implications effectively.
