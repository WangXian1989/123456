  - Limit alcohol consumption.  
  - Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise.  

- **Medications**:  
  - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.  
  - Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune liver diseases.  

- **Regular Monitoring**:  
  - Schedule regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.  

- **Avoidance of Toxins**:  
  - Avoid exposure to harmful substances, including certain chemicals and drugs that may worsen liver damage.
