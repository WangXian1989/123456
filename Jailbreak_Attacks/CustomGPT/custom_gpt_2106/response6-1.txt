To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match.
  - Max out IRA contributions, focusing on a Roth IRA if you're eligible for tax-free withdrawals.

- **Balance Between Growth and Accessibility**:
  - Allocate funds to your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and tax deferral.
  - Keep a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility to access funds without penalties.

- **Diversification**:
  - Diversify investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
  - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk.

- **Monitor and Adjust**:
  - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

This structured approach will help you optimize your investments while balancing growth potential and accessibility.
