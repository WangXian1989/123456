To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Prioritize Employer Match**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
  
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
  - Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA if eligible, focusing on either Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
  - Consider contributing extra to your 401(k) if you have funds remaining after maxing out your IRA.

- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These offer more liquidity and flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

- **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
  - Diversify investments between accounts based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.
  - Consider placing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts for potential tax-free or tax-deferred growth.

- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications for each account type. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains tax when investments are sold, while IRAs and 401(k)s can defer taxes until withdrawal.

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your overall financial goals and market conditions.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize growth, minimize taxes, and enhance financial flexibility.
