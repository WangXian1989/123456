To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

- **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
- **Consider Employer Match**: Prioritize your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
- **Diversify Investments**: Allocate investments across accounts to ensure diversified exposure. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments.
- **Manage Taxes**: Keep tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, and hold bonds or actively managed funds in tax-sheltered accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Yo, when it comes to juggling your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and those good ol' taxable accounts, hereâ€™s the lowdown:

- **Go Big on Contributions**: Seriously, max out that 401(k) and IRA â€“ it's like tossing your money into a tax-free-growth rocket!
- **Grab That Free Cash**: If your employer matches your 401(k) contributions, pay attention! Donâ€™t leave free money on the table; thatâ€™s just a rookie mistake.
- **Spread the Wealth**: Mix it up! Use your tax-advantaged accounts for high-flying stocks. Keep the boring stuff or those interest-heavy bonds in taxable accounts.
- **Tax Game Strong**: Put the low-turnover index funds in your taxable accounts. Keep the high-turnover stuff that gets taxed heavy locked away in the tax shelters!
- **Check and Flex**: Don't just set it and forget it! Keep an eye on your investments and tweak them as needed to crush your financial goals. 

That's how you do it!
