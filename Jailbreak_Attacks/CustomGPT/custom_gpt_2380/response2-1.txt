Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions upfront.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on gains until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using these for investment income that might be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, like qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these investment accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Investment Timeline**:
   - If you have a long time horizon until retirement, consider more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA to maximize growth potential.
   - In taxable accounts, focus on investments that provide tax efficiency and can offer liquidity if needed.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, but be mindful of your overall asset allocation. You don’t want to over-concentrate in certain assets across accounts.

6. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. This applies across all accounts.

7. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Consider tax implications for each account type.

8. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
