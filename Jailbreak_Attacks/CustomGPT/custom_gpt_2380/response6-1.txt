Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match** (if applicable)
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**:
     - Contributions reduce taxable income now, increasing growth potential due to compounding.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Interest and short-term capital gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate. Prioritize long-term investments to minimize tax.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - **Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
     - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible. Withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use for money you might need before retirement, or for investment flexibility.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Younger Investors**: More aggressive investments in stocks.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards bonds to preserve capital.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically (annual or semi-annual) to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
Maximize employer matches, balance tax benefits with withdrawal flexibility, and align your strategy with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Diversification across account types can also enhance your financial stability.
