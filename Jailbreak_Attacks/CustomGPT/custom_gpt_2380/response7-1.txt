Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older).

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax situation. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re age 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These accounts can be beneficial once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short- and medium-term goals.
   - Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains, especially with frequent trading.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of living expenses saved.
- **Retirement Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out your retirement accounts, particularly if there are substantial tax benefits and employer matching.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use these accounts for funds you may need before retirement or if you want to invest in more diverse assets.

### Adjust Based on Goals:
- **Short-Term**: Higher allocation to taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-Term**: Emphasize retirement accounts for tax advantages.

### Review Regularly:
- Regularly assess your allocation based on changing financial goals, market performance, and tax laws.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation. They can help you understand how to balance these accounts based on your overall financial plan.
