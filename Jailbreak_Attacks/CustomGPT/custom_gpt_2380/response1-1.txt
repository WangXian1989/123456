Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for flexibility and liquidity. Capital gains and dividends are taxed annually, so consider this for funds you might need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Investment Horizon:**
   - If you’re younger and have a long investment timeline, prioritize accounts with higher growth potential (like a Roth IRA).
   - For short-term goals, keep more funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter gains from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate taxable income or short-term gains.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Contribute up to the employer match first.
2. **IRA:** Max out contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Account:** Fund after tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds).

### Conclusion:
Tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances and consult a financial advisor for a plan that suits your specific needs.
