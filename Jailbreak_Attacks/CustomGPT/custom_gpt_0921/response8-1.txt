Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth), providing tax benefits now or in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider contributing to both Traditional and Roth IRAs to diversify tax exposure in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 or older for 2023).
   - **Investing in Low-Cost Index Funds**: This can align with long-term growth while minimizing fees.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties, making them good for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in savings before investing heavily.
- **Balanced Approach**: Determine a balanced allocation—generally, higher allocations should go to tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Reassess Annually**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, life goals, or tax situations.

### **Example Allocation**
- Max out your employer's 401(k) match.
- Then, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- If funds allow, contribute further to your 401(k) or Traditional IRA, prioritizing those with lower management fees.
- Finally, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account.

### **Consult with a Financial Advisor**
Every individual's situation is unique, and it’s often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific circumstances.
