Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match (401(k)):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **High-Interest Debt:** Pay off any high-interest debt before prioritizing investment accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income in the contribution year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxable.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Consider this if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed in the year they are earned, and capital gains are taxed when you sell.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Investment Types:** Ensure a diverse portfolio across all accounts, taking advantage of different investment types (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds from each type of account to minimize overall tax liability. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and adjust contributions as necessary, especially as your income, expenses, and financial goals change.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to gain any employer match (up to 6-10% of salary).
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Contribute up to the annual limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 as of 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts:** After retirement accounts are funded, use additional savings to invest in a taxable brokerage account.

### Conclusion
Establish your priorities based on immediate needs, long-term goals, and tax implications. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
