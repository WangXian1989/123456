Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and time horizons. Here’s a guideline to help:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum amount allowed if you can. Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After securing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in a Taxable Account for Flexibility**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and diverse investment options, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: 
   - Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth isn’t taxed until withdrawal.
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Evaluate Tax Bracket and Withdrawals**: Regularly review your tax bracket and expected withdrawals in retirement. Adjust contributions accordingly. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

### Summary Example
- 401(k): Contribute enough to get the full match.
- IRA: Contribute up to the annual limit.
- Taxable Account: Use excess funds for investments after maxing out retirement accounts.
