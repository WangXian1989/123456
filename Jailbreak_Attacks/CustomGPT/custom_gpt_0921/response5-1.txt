Deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions (up to the annual limit) if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If you can, also contribute to an IRA. If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement or for long-term investments that benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize immediate tax impacts.

4. **Future Tax Considerations**: Think about how withdrawals will be taxed. Traditional 401(k) and IRA withdrawals are taxed as income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your investment goals and adjust as necessary.

### Summary
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. Max out IRA contributions if possible.
3. Use taxable accounts for flexibility and specific investment strategies.
4. Diversify across accounts based on tax implications.

### Example Scenario
- If youâ€™re under 50, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get your employer match, then max out a traditional IRA (or Roth if eligible). After that, direct additional funds into your taxable account for flexibility and future opportunities.
