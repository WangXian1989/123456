When deciding how to allocate your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are tax-deferred, potentially lowering your taxable income. Employer matching can boost your savings.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility in withdrawals.

### 2. **Determine Your Goals**
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Allocate more to taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for growth.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Matching**
   - Maximize employer 401(k) matching contributions first.
   - Contribute enough to your IRA (if applicable) to take full advantage of tax benefits.
   - Once these are maxed out, allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts.

### 4. **Consider Investment Options**
   - **401(k):** Usually limited to a selection of mutual funds; check fees.
   - **IRA:** Offers a wider range of investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Flexibility to invest in various assets.

### 5. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Adjust your allocation based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments as they may have tax implications.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize 401(k) (up to employer match)**
- **Contribute to IRA (consider Roth for tax-free retirement growth)**
- **Use taxable accounts for extra savings and investments with higher liquidity**

### User Input
- **What is your investment goal (short-term, long-term, retirement)?**
- **What is your current risk tolerance (low, moderate, high)?**
- **Have you maximized employer contributions and IRA contributions?**
