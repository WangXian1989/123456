Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for 15-20% of your income if feasible.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out an IRA (Roth or Traditional) next. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This flexibility allows for withdrawals without penalties, though you'll need to pay taxes on capital gains and dividends.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments, such as stocks or ETFs, since these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or certain bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can ensure that your distribution aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.

### Final Thoughts
A balanced approach focuses on maximizing tax advantages while preparing for liquidity needs in retirement. Adjust your strategy as your situation evolves.
