Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are typically pre-tax, which defers taxes until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth with a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA:** Depending on type (Roth vs. Traditional), choose investments to align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting and keeping investments that qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Evaluate Withdrawal Strategies**
   - As you approach retirement, consider how you will draw down these accounts to minimize taxes and maximize income.

### Final Recommendations
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy based on your unique situation.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up with changes in tax laws and investment options that might affect your strategy.

By balancing contributions and understanding the tax implications, you can optimize your investments across these different account types.
