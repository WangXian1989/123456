I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver issues typically depend on the specific condition affecting your liver. Here are some general approaches that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugar, and rich in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver health.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, surgeries might be necessary, such as liver transplant for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some may explore options like herbal supplements, but it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting these.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
