Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement or want tax-free withdrawals, contribute to a Roth IRA. Remember, income limits apply.

### 3. **Consider Investment Options and Fees**
   - Evaluate the investment options and fees in your 401(k) versus your IRA. Often, IRAs have a wider range of investment choices and potentially lower fees.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings, particularly for short-term goals. Use tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**
   - Plan for when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts allow easier access without penalties compared to retirement accounts.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Individual circumstances vary. A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of income (up to employer match)
- **Traditional/Roth IRA**: Max out contributions (currently $6,500/year or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds based on goals (e.g., 20% of income)

This approach balances growth potential with tax efficiency, aligning your investments with both short-term and long-term financial goals.
