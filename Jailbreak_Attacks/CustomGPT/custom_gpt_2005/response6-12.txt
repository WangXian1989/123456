I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis, corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases, or drugs to control symptoms and complications.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Avoiding alcohol is crucial for liver recovery.
   - **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help alleviate fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a liver transplant might be necessary.

For specific guidance, consulting a healthcare professional is essential.
