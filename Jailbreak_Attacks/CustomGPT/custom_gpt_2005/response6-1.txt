To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Tax Efficiency
1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Maximize 401(k)** contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
   - Consider Traditional vs. Roth IRA based on current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends.

### Contribution Limits
- Stay aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type.
- Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts after maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

### Investment Strategy
- Assess your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account.
- Opt for more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes on growth are deferred.

### Rebalance Regularly
- Adjust allocations periodically based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, prioritizing tax efficiency and the respective benefits of each account type, will maximize growth and minimize tax liabilities over time.
