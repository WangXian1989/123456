To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high-income bracket.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Debt Management**:
   - Pay off high-interest debt before committing excessive funds to investments, as the interest on debt can often exceed investment returns.

3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically, these accounts can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles. Since they offer tax-deferred growth, consider placing higher-growth assets like stocks here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan withdrawals strategically, taking from taxable accounts first (to utilize lower tax rates) and defer withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts if possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It's beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual financial situation and goals.

By considering these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
