Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may offer tax advantages, such as long-term capital gains from stocks or municipal bonds. This can be beneficial for funds you may need before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Tailor the asset allocation in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, consider placing higher-growth, more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize your tax burden.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
