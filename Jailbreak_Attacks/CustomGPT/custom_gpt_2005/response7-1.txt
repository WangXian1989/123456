To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Focus on higher growth investments here.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate lower tax rates (like long-term capital gains).

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This helps manage risk and targets various time horizons.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix and adjust based on performance and changing goals.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Keep some liquid savings outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, allowing your retirement funds to grow undisturbed.

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement: draw from taxable first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.
