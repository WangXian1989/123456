1. **Medications:** Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthy diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can support liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and blood tests can help track liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, options such as liver transplant or other surgical interventions might be recommended.
