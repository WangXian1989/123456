Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA or Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can boost your long-term savings.

3. **Consider Investment Growth**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments, such as stocks, since they are tax-advantaged. Taxable accounts are better suited for investments that generate income, as interest and dividends can be taxed at higher rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of which account holds what.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a taxable account for liquidity, as withdrawing from retirement accounts typically incurs penalties and taxes.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Needs**: If you plan to need the money before retirement, consider keeping those funds in taxable accounts to avoid penalties.

7. **Monitor Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts. Withdrawals from a 401(k) or traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals may be tax-free if certain conditions are met.

8. **Reassess Periodically**: Regularly review your investment allocation and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and new financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
