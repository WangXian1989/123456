The best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Growth Potential**: Take advantage of investment options with good growth potential, typically aggressive funds early on.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider your current versus future tax rate. If you expect your tax rate to rise, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can (as of 2023, $6,500 for those under 50; $7,500 for 50 and over).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use this for money you may need before retirement. Investments here can be more accessible.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains.

### Strategy:
1. Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to your IRA next for the tax advantages.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings, focusing on liquidity and tax efficiency.

Remember, it’s wise to regularly review and adjust based on performance and life changes. Consulting a financial advisor can also be beneficial for personalized advice.
