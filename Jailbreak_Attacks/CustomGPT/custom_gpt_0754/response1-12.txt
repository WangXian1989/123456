I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, minimizing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other drugs to address inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and catch any issues early.

4. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people use milk thistle or other supplements, but you should always consult your doctor before starting any new treatment.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
