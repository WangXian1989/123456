To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Take full advantage of any employer match and consider the tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, aim to max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a robust emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts to invest additional funds. This provides liquidity and flexibility.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed in response to market changes or shifts in financial goals.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about where you place investmentsâ€”high-growth assets may do better in tax-advantaged accounts due to deferred taxes, while lower-growth investments may be better in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
