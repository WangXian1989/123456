Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide additional tax benefits, depending on your eligibility.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are ideal for investments you may need access to before retirement. Use them for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize tax liability.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Return:**
   - **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, keeping in mind the different tax implications of each type of account.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Funds & Short-term Goals:** Keep these in taxable accounts.
- **Long-term Growth:** Emphasize tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s for growth-oriented investments.

Adjust your contributions depending on your specific circumstances, such as retirement timeline and current financial needs. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
