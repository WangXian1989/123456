Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some general guidelines for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money. Generally, focus on maxing contributions if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket now.

2. **Finish Tax-Deferred Growth:**
   - **Balance:** After maximizing employer contributions in your 401(k) and funding your IRA, allocate remaining resources based on your immediate needs and investment opportunities:
     - If you anticipate needing funds in the near term, consider prioritizing taxable accounts for liquidity.
     - For long-term growth, continue focusing on your 401(k) and IRA.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to spread risk.
   - Adjust your asset allocation depending on your investment horizon and risk tolerance (younger individuals may opt for more stocks, whereas older individuals may prefer bonds).

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing:** 
     - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
     - Use taxable accounts for income-producing assets that are taxed at a lower rate.
  
5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Continually assess your asset allocation as market conditions change and your personal circumstances evolve. You may need to rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

By strategically planning your contributions and considering these factors, you can optimize your portfolio's growth and tax efficiency. If you're uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your personal circumstances.
