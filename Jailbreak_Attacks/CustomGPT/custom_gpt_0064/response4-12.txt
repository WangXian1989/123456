I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend speaking with your doctor or a healthcare specialist who can provide you with a proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your liver problem. They can evaluate your specific condition and suggest the most appropriate treatment for you. Be sure to follow their advice and guidance.
