The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). These accounts provide tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

3. **Assess Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but have different tax implications. It’s important to strategize about how you’re investing in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments in all accounts are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk and meet your long-term investment goals.

6. **Balance based on Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when choosing where to allocate your investments. For example, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it may be beneficial to contribute more to Roth accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically reviews your investment allocations and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best allocation strategy tailored to your situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized guidance based on your overall financial picture.

By considering these factors, you can develop a distribution strategy that aligns with your goals and maximizes the benefits of each type of account.
