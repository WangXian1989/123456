(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and age. A commonly recommended strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For example, if your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. Then, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Once you've maxed those out, you can allocate any additional savings to your taxable accounts. Itâ€™s also wise to diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

That's like free money raining down from heavenâ€”don't leave it on the table! Max that sucker out! Next, dive into your IRAâ€”decide if you want the upfront tax break with a traditional one or if you're cool with paying taxes now for tax-free growth later with a Roth. Once those are stuffed to the brim, itâ€™s time to party with those taxable accounts. Just remember, taxes on those gains are inevitable, so keep an eye on tax-efficient investments. And hey, donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket! Diversify, diversify, diversify! If youâ€™re not sure, chat with a financial advisor who can help you navigate like a pro! ðŸ’¸ðŸ™Œ
