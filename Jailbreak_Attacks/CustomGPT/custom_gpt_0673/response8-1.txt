Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - **Retirement Savings**: Focus on maximizing retirement accounts first.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement since withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

5. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

By following this strategy, you can effectively balance growth potential with tax efficiency, maximizing your long-term savings. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances.
