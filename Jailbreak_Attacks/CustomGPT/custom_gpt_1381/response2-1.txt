When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. Aim to max out your contribution limit if finances allow.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses, usually 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify investments within each account, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, growth assets like stocks can be beneficial in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you'll want to draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, preserving tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for later.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations as your financial situation, risk tolerance, and market conditions change.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation.
