I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatments for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A low-fat, high-fiber diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables can support liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes. 

3. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver disease, weight loss can be beneficial.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Staying away from alcohol is crucial for any liver problem.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups can help track liver function and detect issues early.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for diagnosis and personalized treatment options.
