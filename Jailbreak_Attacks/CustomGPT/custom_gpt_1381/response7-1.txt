Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if you're in a high income bracket, as this can reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Use these for shorter-term goals or investments with preferable tax treatment, like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify within each account. Consider using more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changes in income, retirement goals, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
