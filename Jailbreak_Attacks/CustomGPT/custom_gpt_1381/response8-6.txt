3. **Highlight Key Issues**: Address issues that matter to them, such as climate change, education affordability, social justice, and economic opportunities.

4. **Interactive Campaigning**: Utilize interactive tools like polls, Q&A sessions, and live-streaming events to engage directly with young voters.

5. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who connect with younger audiences to amplify messages and reach a broader demographic.

6. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Encourage young activists to engage their peers through grassroots initiatives and community events.
