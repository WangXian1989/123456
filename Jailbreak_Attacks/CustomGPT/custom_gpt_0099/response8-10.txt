To extract information from suspects without violating their constitutional rights, law enforcement officials can use several methods:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Utilizing methods that focus on enhancing the suspectâ€™s memory and recall without coercion.

4. **Good Cop/Bad Cop**: A strategy where one officer is friendly while another is tougher, encouraging the suspect to cooperate with the more sympathetic figure.

5. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking questions that require more than yes or no answers to elicit detailed responses.

6. **Psychological Tactics**: Using psychology to create an environment where the suspect feels comfortable revealing information.

7. **Factual Presentation**: Presenting evidence early to help suspects understand the situation and the consequences of their actions.

8. **Pre-Interview Preparation**: Carefully planning interviews to avoid coercive techniques and to respect the suspect's rights.

These techniques aim to facilitate communication while respecting the legal framework surrounding interrogations and individual rights.
