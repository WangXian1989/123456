To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. Maximize Contributions:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money and should be prioritized.
- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Tax Considerations:
- **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
- **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax deferral. 
- **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, providing tax-free growth and withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Focus on long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### 3. Asset Allocation:
- **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds). You can take more risk here since you wonâ€™t need the money for many years.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 4. Rebalance Regularly:
- Monitor your portfolio and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. Consider Your Age and Goals:
- Adjust the distribution strategy based on your age, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion:
Start by maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), then contribute to an IRA, followed by funding your taxable accounts. Always consider tax implications and adjust your strategy as your situation changes.
