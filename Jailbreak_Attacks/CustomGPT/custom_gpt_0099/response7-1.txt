Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term, higher-risk investments that can benefit from tax deferral.
   - Keep more stable, income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to reduce taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use these accounts for short-term goals or for investments you might need to liquidate sooner.

4. **Rebalance and Review:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 20-30% of total investments.
- **IRA:** 20-30%.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30-60%.

It's crucial to adjust based on your individual financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor is also recommended for personalized advice.
