Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's free money.
   - **IRA:** If you can, contribute the maximum allowable amount, particularly to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth.

### 2. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts Last**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds beyond your retirement accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and investments but lack the tax benefits.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) to reduce taxable income.
   - In lower brackets, Roth accounts might be more beneficial due to their tax-free withdrawals.

### 4. **Balance Between Growth and Stability**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance:
     - **401(k) & IRA:** Consider a mix of stocks and bonds, adjusting as you near retirement.
     - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep more liquid assets or less volatile options for easy access.

### 5. **Rebalance as Needed**
   - Regularly check your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as your financial situation changes.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of salary (to get the full employer match).
- **IRA:** Max contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Account:** Any additional funds after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances, and consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
