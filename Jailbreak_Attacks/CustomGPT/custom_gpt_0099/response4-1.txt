To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer matches, contribute at least up to the match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, contribute to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: 
     - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
     - Consider bonds or interest-generating investments in taxable accounts, as they can be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

3. **Taxable Account Strategy**:
   - Invest for the long term to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can tailor the strategy to your financial situation.

By following these principles, you can build a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
