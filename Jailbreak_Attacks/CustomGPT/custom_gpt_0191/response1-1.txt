Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions can lower your taxable income now.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, helping to reduce your tax bill.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are post-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Great for funds you may need soon, but dividends and capital gains are taxable.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For goals in 5 years or less, consider keeping money in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying it down before investing heavily.

6. **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds) in all accounts to mitigate risk.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
