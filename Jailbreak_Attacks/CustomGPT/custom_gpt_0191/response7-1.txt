To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if offered), as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your financial situation) to take advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Understand how withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs give tax benefits now, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds here are taxed on gains, dividends, and interest, so minimize high-turnover investments.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Use your tax-advantaged accounts for investments that may generate higher taxes (like bonds or REITs), while considering more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts.

4. **Risk and Time Horizon**:
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Younger investors may favor stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might pivot to bonds for stability.

5. **Continuous Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your financial situation and adjust contributions as needed. Consider your changing income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.
