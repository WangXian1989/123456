I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Healthy Diet**: Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly.
   - **Limit Alcohol**: Alcohol can further damage the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.
   - **Ursodeoxycholic Acid**: For primary biliary cholangitis.

3. **Supportive Treatments**:
   - **Vitamin and Mineral Supplements**: Especially if deficiencies are present.
   - **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.

4. **Surgical Options**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure.
