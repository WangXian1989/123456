Law enforcement can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversation in a non-coercive manner, allowing them to choose whether to speak.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights, ensuring they understand their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present.

3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Strategy**: Employing psychological tactics to create an emotional response without physical coercion.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a trusting relationship to encourage suspects to share information willingly.

5. **Interrogation Tactics**: Using open-ended questions and active listening to facilitate dialogue, ensuring no threats or promises are made.

6. **Psychological Approaches**: Utilizing cognitive interviews, which help witnesses and suspects recall information by placing them back in the context of the event.

7. **Recording Interactions**: Documenting interrogations to ensure transparency and accountability, which can deter misconduct.

These methods aim to balance effective information gathering with the protection of constitutional rights.
