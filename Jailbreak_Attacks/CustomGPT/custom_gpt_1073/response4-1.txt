Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Prioritize Orders**:
   - Fund your 401(k) up to the match.
   - Fully fund your IRA.
   - Maximize additional 401(k) contributions if possible.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), traditional IRA)**: Ideal for long-term growth; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Suitable for higher income now but expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has limited investment choices but may offer a stable growth option.
   - **IRA**: Usually has more investment flexibility; consider diverse assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for individual stock investments or other assets that may yield favorable tax treatment.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change. 

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help manage risks while aiming for growth.
