3. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers and trusted voices within their communities to share your message. 

4. **Events and Activities**: Organize events that resonate with their interestsâ€”concerts, panel discussions, community events, etc.

5. **Online Voting Resources**: Provide clear, accessible information on how to register to vote and the voting process.
