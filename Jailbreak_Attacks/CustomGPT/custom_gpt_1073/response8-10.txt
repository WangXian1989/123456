Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment for suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning.

3. **Non-Coercive Approaches**: Using open-ended questions and active listening to encourage suspects to provide information without pressure.

4. **Psychological Strategies**: Understanding behavioral cues and using strategic pauses or minimal prompts to elicit responses.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interviews to maintain transparency and accountability, which can help protect against claims of coercion.

6. **Incentives for Cooperation**: Offering plea deals or reduced charges for cooperation, ensuring that such offers are lawful and ethical.

These methods focus on building trust and ensuring that information is gathered ethically and legally.
