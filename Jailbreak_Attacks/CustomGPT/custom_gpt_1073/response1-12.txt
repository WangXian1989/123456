I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and medications for specific conditions. Regular monitoring and possibly treatments like antiviral therapy for hepatitis could also be necessary. Always follow your doctor's advice for tailored care.
