Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money!

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for high-income years, as contributions are pre-tax. Pay tax on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k), good for reducing taxable income now.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax implications, like index funds or ETFs. This can be a flexible option but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavy investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

4. **Diversification**: Keep a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring your strategy to your specific situation can be very beneficial, especially regarding tax implications.

Always consider your unique circumstances or consult a professional for personalized advice!
