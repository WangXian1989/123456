Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - **Maximize your 401(k) contributions** up to any matching limit offered by your employer. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - After taking full advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an **IRA** (either traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. 

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Any additional savings can be directed to **taxable accounts**. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity but may not have the same tax benefits as retirement accounts.

### 4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Invest tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in taxable accounts since they generate lower taxable events. Use tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy (asset allocation) aligns with your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Typically, stocks are favored for growth in retirement accounts, while bonds might be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as needed. Market fluctuations can shift your asset allocation, and you want to stay aligned with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By effectively utilizing these accounts, you can optimize your savings, minimize taxes, and achieve your financial goals.
