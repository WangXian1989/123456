Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** If you can, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts provide tax advantages, either during contributions (traditional) or withdrawals (Roth).
   - **401(k):** Beyond the match, aim to maximize your contributions if your goal is high retirement savings. The limit is higher than that for IRAs.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications in Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, such as qualified dividends and long-term capital gains. This way, you're less affected by higher tax rates on short-term gains and interest.
   - Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts since they generate interest that is taxed as ordinary income.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**
   - As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting your asset allocation to more conservative investments to preserve capital. This is crucial as you won’t have as much time to recover from market downturns.

### 6. **Revisit and Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance and life changes (e.g., job change, marriage, etc.).

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **50% in 401(k):** To benefit from employer matching and tax deferral.
- **30% in IRA:** For additional tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (if Roth).
- **20% in Taxable Accounts:** For liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion
The best distribution strategy hinges on your financial objectives, current financial situation, and future needs. Consulting with a financial advisor is also a wise move to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances.
