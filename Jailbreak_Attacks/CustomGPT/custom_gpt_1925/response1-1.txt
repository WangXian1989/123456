To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following five strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, the tax implications differ. A traditional IRA defers taxes, while Roth contributions grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. Keep investments with high turnover or frequent distributions here.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before contributing significantly, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) to avoid early withdrawals.

3. **Maximizing Contributions**:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable to both the 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, it's $22,500 for the 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions available if you're over 50).

4. **Investment Strategies**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s) for higher growth investments (like stocks) that may incur taxes if sold, and keep tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed. Adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation, retirement goals, and market performance.

**Final Tip**: Consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your circumstances.
