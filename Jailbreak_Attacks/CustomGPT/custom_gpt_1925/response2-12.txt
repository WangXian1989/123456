I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health and common treatment options. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health. Avoiding processed foods, added sugars, and saturated fats is also beneficial.
   - **Hydration**: Drinking plenty of water supports liver function.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk of liver disease.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), specific medications may be prescribed.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is essential as it can significantly affect liver health.

4. **Regular Check-ups**: Routine monitoring through blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and catch any issues early.

5. **Consider Supplements**: Some supplements (like milk thistle) are thought to support liver health, but you should consult a doctor before starting any new supplement.

6. **Treat Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity can affect liver health. Managing these can improve liver function.

Always seek advice from a healthcare professional to discuss symptoms and appropriate treatments tailored to your specific situation.
