(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:** Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA first. Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions can lower your taxable income now, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Diversification:** Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) and hold higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before maximizing contributions to all retirement accounts.

Reassess your situation regularly and consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down! Itâ€™s like balancing your financial buffetâ€”everyone's got their taste. First off, definitely grab that sweet employer match in your 401(k)â€”itâ€™s like stealing candy from a baby but legal. Then, dive into your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth. Who doesnâ€™t want that tax-free growth?

Now, hereâ€™s the kicker: your taxable accounts should house investments that wonâ€™t hit you with a tax bomb every year. Think low-turnover funds and maybe some solid blue-chip stocks. Keep the wild stuff and high-yield assets tucked away in your tax-advantaged accounts. 

And for the love of all things financial, donâ€™t forget an emergency fund! Once that's set, play around with the proportions, but donâ€™t go crazy without a plan. Get a pro if you need it, but know your own vibeâ€”everyoneâ€™s got different goals, and itâ€™s your cash!
