When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to maximize growth and minimize taxes:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Max out any employer match as itâ€™s effectively free money. Then contribute to the maximum allowed, benefiting from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA:** Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA is more advantageous. A Traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits, while a Roth provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Diversification of Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments (e.g., stocks) to maximize tax deferral. Keep more conservative investments (e.g., bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities on interest income.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target risk level and ensure optimal growth.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place investments that generate higher ordinary income, like bonds or REITs, in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable capital gains tax treatment (like stocks held for over a year).

### 4. **Long-Term Planning:**
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax implications in retirement, considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) from tax-deferred accounts.
   - Be mindful of income limits when contributing to IRAs and explore backdoor Roth IRA strategies if applicable.

### Conclusion:
Balancing these elements requires regular assessments and adjustments based on market conditions and personal financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific situation.
