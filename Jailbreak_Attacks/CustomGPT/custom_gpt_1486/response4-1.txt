Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if one is offered; this is free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, allowing for tax-deferred growth.
- **Consider Fees**: Be mindful of any high fees associated with your 401(k) investments.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
- **Flexibility**: Roth IRAs provide more flexibility in retirement, and you can withdraw contributions at any time without penalty.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: These accounts offer the most flexibility; you can withdraw money without penalties or restrictions.
- **Capital Gains Tax**: Be aware of tax implications when selling investments; long-term capital gains are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
- **Investment Strategy**: Consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains for better tax efficiency.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund separate from these accounts.
2. **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debt before investing heavily.
3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, then invest in taxable accounts.
4. **Balanced Portfolio**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk.
5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### **Personal Considerations**
- Consider your age, retirement goals, and overall financial situation.
- Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific needs.

Allocating funds effectively can significantly impact your retirement planning and tax efficiency, so consider these factors carefully.
