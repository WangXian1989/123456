Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k):** Contributing to your 401(k) allows your investments to grow tax-deferred. Choose a mix of traditional and Roth contributions if available.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible for access to funds and can be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Consider investment strategies like tax-loss harvesting to mitigate your tax burden.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in both your retirement and taxable accounts to manage risk and enhance returns.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changing financial situations, tax laws, and retirement goals. Adjustments may be necessary as you approach retirement.

It's a good idea to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances.
