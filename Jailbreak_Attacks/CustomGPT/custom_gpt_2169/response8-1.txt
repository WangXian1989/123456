Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim to max out contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs allow tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you might need before retirement or for short-term goals. Keep in mind capital gains taxes when selling investments.
   - **Asset Location**: Consider holding high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (to defer taxes) and more stable, income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax liability effectively.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a savings account or other liquid assets outside of your investment accounts.

### 5. **Debt Prioritization**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before maxing out investments.

### 6. **Adjust for Risk Tolerance**
   - Your age and risk tolerance should guide how aggressively you invest. Younger investors may lean more heavily into equities.

### 7. **Review Contributions Annually**
   - Regularly assess your income, expenses, and investment performance. Adjust your contributions based on life changes or market conditions.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach typically involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before considering taxable accounts. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
