Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is effectively free money and should be a priority.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: After 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions to these accounts if possible, as they provide tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for:
   - Short-term goals (like saving for a home).
   - Investments that generate lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across these accounts are diversified to spread risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Keep in mind your future withdrawal strategy. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts are often subject to penalties if withdrawn before a certain age.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocation to respond to changes in market conditions, goals, and risk tolerance.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your personal situation can also help you optimize your strategy.
