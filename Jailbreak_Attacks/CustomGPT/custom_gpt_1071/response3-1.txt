Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Good for current tax savings.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar pre-tax benefits, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals after age 59½.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Capital gains and dividends are taxed, but these can be beneficial for liquidity.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate, easily accessible account before heavily investing in these accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Allocate investments across accounts to balance risk. You might want to hold more aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your anticipated retirement income sources. Tax-advantaged accounts are usually best for long-term growth, while taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset allocation regularly to align with your goals and risk tolerance.
