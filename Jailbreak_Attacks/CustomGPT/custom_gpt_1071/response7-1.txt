To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax).
   - Maximize contributions to benefit from tax advantages. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for goals with a shorter time frame, or for investments you might want to access without penalties.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth to minimize taxes now.
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, managing capital gains appropriately.

5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, or financial goals.
