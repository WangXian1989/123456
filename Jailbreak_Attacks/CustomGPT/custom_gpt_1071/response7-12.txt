I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet low in fats, sugars, and processed foods can help. Regular exercise is also beneficial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption can greatly improve liver health.

4. **Weight Management**: Losing weight if overweight can help reverse conditions like fatty liver disease.

5. **Regular Check-ups**: Monitoring liver function through regular blood tests is essential.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
