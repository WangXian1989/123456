Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it's free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. 
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs can also offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

3. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure that your investments in all accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance. 

4. **Taxable Accounts:** These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and may be advantageous for rebalancing your portfolio, but remember you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Future Withdrawals:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean more towards Roth accounts. Conversely, if you expect a lower bracket, traditional accounts might be better.

6. **Regular Review:** Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
