Diversifying your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and growth potential. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full match if available.
   - **Invest for Growth**: Choose a mix of equities for long-term growth, especially if you're younger.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Diversification**: Use your IRA for a mix of bonds and stocks, balancing risk according to your time horizon.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or ETFs (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Focus on Dividends**: You can hold investments that offer qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### General Tips
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before making aggressive investments.
- **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth and manage tax implications effectively!
