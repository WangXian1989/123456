I'm not a doctor, but general treatment options for liver problems usually depend on the specific condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol intake, and losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver disease (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), there may be specific medications to treat it. 

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and monitoring liver function through blood tests or imaging studies may be necessary.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant might be required.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
