The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) as these accounts provide tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Max Out 401(k)**: After your IRA contribution, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions. The limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Traditional accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) provide tax-deferred growth, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw. Roth accounts (Roth IRA) allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you may choose to prioritize one type over the other.

4. **Consider Your Investment Time Horizon**: If you're saving for retirement that's decades away, you might consider taking on more risk in your investment strategy. In this case, a higher allocation in stocks within your 401(k) and IRA might be suitable. For taxable accounts, consider more conservative investments to mitigate potential tax implications from capital gains.

5. **Diversification in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate less tax liability, such as index funds or tax-managed funds. This can help you keep capital gains taxes minimal.

6. **Evaluate Withdrawals and Income Needs**: If you may need access to your money before retirement, prioritize your taxable accounts for that liquidity, as early withdrawals from retirement accounts may incur penalties.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your portfolio and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also recommended, as they can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
