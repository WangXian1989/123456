The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and an excellent starting point.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider funding your IRA (either Traditional or Roth based on your eligibility and tax situation) before putting more money into your 401(k). IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After you’ve maxed out your IRA contributions, you can continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. If your 401(k) has high fees or limited investment options, weigh that against other investment accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've optimized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional money into taxable investment accounts. These can offer more flexibility but will be subject to capital gains tax when you sell investments.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s will be taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free. Taxable accounts have different tax treatments for dividends, interest, and capital gains.

6. **Keep an Eye on Your Investment Horizon**: Adjust your investment strategies based on your time horizon for needing the funds. Younger investors might prioritize growth assets in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to focus on preservation of capital.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified among different asset classes to manage risk effectively.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance that aligns with your personal financial strategy while maximizing tax efficiency during your investing journey.
