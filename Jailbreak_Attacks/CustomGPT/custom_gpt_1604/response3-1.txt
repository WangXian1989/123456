The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**: Determine what you are saving for (retirement, a home, education, etc.) and your investment timeline.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, but contributions may be deductible based on income and filing status. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages like retirement accounts, and youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes on profits during the year they are realized.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before putting extra into an IRA or taxable account.

4. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After securing the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs (both traditional and Roth) as they provide tax benefits.

5. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Rates**: If you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA or after-tax contributions may be advantageous. If you think it will be lower, traditional accounts are potentially better.

6. **Balance Your Investments**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: As markets fluctuate, the distribution of your investments may change. Review and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, especially regarding current tax laws and personal financial circumstances.
