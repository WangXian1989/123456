Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. However, here are some general guidelines you can consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Consider whether a traditional (pre-tax) 401(k) or Roth 401(k) (after-tax) option is more beneficial for your tax situation, based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If you qualify, fully fund your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) as they offer tax-advantaged growth. The contribution limits may vary, so check the latest limits.
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which might be more advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investing beyond your retirement accounts. They provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or tax-efficient funds, to minimize tax burden in a taxable account.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get a full employer match, then fund an IRA to its limit if possible.
2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) to increase contributions toward the maximum limit.
3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**: If you have remaining funds after contributing to retirement accounts, invest in a taxable account for other savings and growth opportunities.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly review asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, market performance, retirement goals, and tax law changes.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.
