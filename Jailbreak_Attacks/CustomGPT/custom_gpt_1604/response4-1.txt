When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if applicable) because this is essentially free money. After that, consider putting money in an IRA as these accounts can offer tax advantages. 

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has specific contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (plus a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

3. **Tax Considerations**: Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions but tax you on withdrawals, while Roth accounts (if available) provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth options may be beneficial.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, consider diversifying your investments, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time until retirement.

5. **Flexibility of Taxable Accounts**: Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility with withdrawals without penalties, making them useful for nearness to short-term financial goals or emergencies. Earnings in these accounts are taxed, but capital gains can be managed through strategic selling.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Consider your long-term strategy. If you're focusing on retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. If you need liquidity or have short-term goals, emphasize taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your contributions and account allocations. Life circumstances and tax rules can change, so it's vital to adjust your strategy accordingly.

It's important to tailor these strategies to your unique situation, and consulting with a financial advisor may provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation.
