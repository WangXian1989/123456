When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider pre-tax contributions for tax reduction now, or Roth contributions for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - Aim to max out contributions if possible, as IRAs usually have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or emergencies since they offer liquidity.
   - Invest in tax-efficient strategies, like index funds or tax-exempt bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in cash.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debts first.
- **Aggressive Funding**: Focus on 401(k) and IRA contributions until maxed out, then allocate funds to taxable accounts.
  
### Reassessment:
- Regularly review your asset allocation based on goals, risk tolerance, and market changes. Adjust as needed.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
