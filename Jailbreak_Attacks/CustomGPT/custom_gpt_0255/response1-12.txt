I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems generally include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - Exercise regularly.
   - Avoid alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications or other specific drugs.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular follow-ups with a healthcare professional to track liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a personalized approach and to understand your specific condition.
