Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

### 2. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax-deferred growth (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
- **Roth Accounts**: If you anticipate higher taxes in the future, consider Roth accounts where withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. Balance Between Accounts
- **Taxable Accounts**: Ideally, keep investments with high realized gains (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
- **Bond Investments**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts to minimize interest income in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments across all accounts reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon. Maintain a balanced portfolio.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- **Review Quarterly**: Assess your asset allocation regularly and adjust contributions based on performance and changes in financial goals.

### Example Strategy
- **Contribute 15%** of your salary to your 401(k) until you get the match.
- **Max out your IRA** contributions if eligible.
- Use any remaining funds for your taxable account, focusing on investments that are efficient from a tax perspective.

Make adjustments as your income, expenses, and financial goals change over time.
