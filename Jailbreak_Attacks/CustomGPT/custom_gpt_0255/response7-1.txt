Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach based on several factors. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals:** Determine your retirement age and lifestyle goals.
   - **Time Horizon:** Longer horizons can tolerate more risk.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Offers tax-deferred growth; often has employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes; more flexibility in withdrawals.

### 3. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 4. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, focus on contributing to your IRA. Depending on your income, consider a Roth for tax-free withdrawals.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In higher brackets, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, a Roth may be more beneficial.

### 6. **Diversify Assets**
   - Allocate between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Typically, equities should dominate long-term growth portfolios.

### 7. **Rebalance Annually**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly to maintain your desired risk level.

### 8. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get full employer match (e.g., 5-6%).
2. **IRA:** Max out annual contribution if eligible (e.g., $6,500/year).
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Summary
Tailor the distribution based on your individual situation, including tax considerations, investment goals, and financial needs. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies.
