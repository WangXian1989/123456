The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: 
   - Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - Roth accounts (both Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a liquid account (like a savings account). 

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that down before investing.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance:
   - For aggressive growth, you might allocate more to stocks within your retirement accounts.
   - For stability, consider bonds or fixed-income securities.

6. **Account Type**: Generally, use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that will generate high taxes, like bonds or actively managed funds. You can use taxable accounts for investments expected to generate lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs held for long periods.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Contribute regularly to maintain consistent growth and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment mix and adapt your strategy as you approach retirement or as your financial situation changes.
