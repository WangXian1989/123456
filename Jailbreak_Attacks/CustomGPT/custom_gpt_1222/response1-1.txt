Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it's essentially free money.
   - Max out contributions if possible, as these accounts have tax advantages (pre-tax or Roth). 

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider opening a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. 
   - If you're eligible, prioritize maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for funds you might need before retirement, as they don’t have early withdrawal penalties. 
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider keeping bonds or other income-generating investments outside of tax-advantaged accounts due to their tax implications.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each type of account.
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

5. **Long-term Planning**:
   - Consult with a financial advisor to develop a comprehensive strategy tailored to your personal financial situation.
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and make adjustments as needed based on life changes, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so personal research or professional advice is recommended.
