When considering how to best distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money and an excellent way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of any employer match, prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older). These accounts offer significant tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, you might prefer a Roth IRA, where your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Conversely, if you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, you might opt for a Traditional IRA or 401(k), where you receive a tax deduction on contributions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts. This is important for liquidity needs and provides flexibility since money in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type. Your allocation should align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts and rebalance your investment portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the exact percentage you should allocate to each type of account will depend on your specific financial circumstances, goals, and timeline. It may be helpful to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
