I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you're facing. For non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, lifestyle changes like diet and exercise are often recommended. For viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed. In cases of liver cirrhosis, managing complications and possibly considering a liver transplant are necessary. Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan.
