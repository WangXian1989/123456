Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment time frame, and risk tolerance. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if you can afford it, as contributions lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Investments**: 
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - The choice between the two depends on whether you anticipate being in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Allocate funds to taxable accounts for short-term goals (like buying a house) or for investments that may yield capital gains, as long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed more favorably compared to ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund covering 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

6. **Future Tax Considerations**: 
   - Think about your future tax implications. There might be advantages to pulling from tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) in lower-income years.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Consider discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial goals and circumstances.

Your optimal distribution strategy will vary based on your individual circumstances and changing financial needs over time.
