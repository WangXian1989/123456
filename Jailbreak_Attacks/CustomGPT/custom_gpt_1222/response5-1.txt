(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. For example, you might want to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that is essentially ‚Äúfree‚Äù money. Next, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Once you‚Äôve maximized contributions to these accounts, you can allocate additional funds to your taxable accounts. 

In terms of asset allocation, you might want to place higher-growth investments like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free, while keeping more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications. It's advisable to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that best suits your specific circumstances.

Slam as much as you can into that puppy to snag any employer match‚Äîbecause who doesn't want free money, right? After that, if you're a Roth IRA kinda person, toss some dough there for those tax-free withdrawals later. If you can‚Äôt do a Roth, hit up that traditional IRA and get those tax deductions now! 

Once you've maxed out those golden accounts, it‚Äôs time to throw some fun into the mix with your taxable accounts. You can let those investments hang loose there‚Äîthe cool kids usually throw stocks in there for growth but play it smart with the tax hits. Keep an eye on taxes because Uncle Sam loves to take his cut. And remember, everyone's situation is different, so maybe chat with a finance wizard if you're unsure where to land!
