The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### 3. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Consider holding bonds and other less tax-efficient investments here, as they grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth IRAs).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Hold stocks or other investments that benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If youâ€™re early in your career, a higher allocation to growth-oriented investments may be favored.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Conclusion
Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique situation.
