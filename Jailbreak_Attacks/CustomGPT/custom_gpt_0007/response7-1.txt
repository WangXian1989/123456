The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your eligibility and tax strategy). These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **401(k)**: Growth is tax-deferred; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility, but you’ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains. Consider holding investments that produce lower taxable income (like index funds).

### 3. **Balance Growth and Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep enough in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals (typically 3-6 months of expenses).
   - Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### 4. **Diversify Investments within Accounts**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term, higher-growth investments (like stocks).
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) or investments that generate lower taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Revisit your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, then consider additional investments in your taxable account. Tailor each account’s investments based on growth potential, tax implications, and your access to funds. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
