Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **First Step**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Next Step**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - **After IRA**: Once you're maximizing employer match and contributing to an IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Final Step**: Invest in taxable accounts for more flexibility and quicker access to funds without penalties, ideal for short-term goals or if you may need access to cash before retirement.

### 5. **Consider Taxes and Fees**
   - Keep an eye on the tax implications of withdrawals and investment gains, as well as any fees in your accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations regularly based on performance, changes in your risk tolerance, and life circumstances.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By considering these steps, you'll be better positioned to allocate your money efficiently across these different account types.
