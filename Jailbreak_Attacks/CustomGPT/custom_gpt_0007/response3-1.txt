Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Accounts Based on Tax Benefits**

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Consider maximizing contributions to take advantage of pre-tax savings and tax-deferred growth.

- **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

- **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. This flexibility can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**

- **401(k)**: Check your plan’s contribution limits (e.g., $22,500 for 2024, with a catch-up of $7,500 if over age 50).
- **IRA**: Limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2024.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No limits, but consider capital gains tax implications.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth for long-term investments. Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Age and Timeline**

- Younger investors can afford to take more risks in their 401(k) and IRA.
- As retirement approaches, gradually shift towards more conservative investments.

### 5. **Review Regularly**

- Annually assess your contributions and investment performance to ensure alignment with your goals and adjust as necessary.
