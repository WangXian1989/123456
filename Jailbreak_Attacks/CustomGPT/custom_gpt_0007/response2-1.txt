Distributing money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money). Aim to max out if feasible, as contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. A traditional IRA can also offer tax deductions.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Investment Goals**
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts due to compound growth. 
   - For short-term needs, keep funds in taxable accounts, as they offer more flexibility.

### 3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place assets that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable capital gains treatment (e.g., stocks).

### 4. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account but align overall risk with your timeline and tolerance.

### 5. **Stay Flexible**
   - Adjust contributions annually based on performance, changes in income, or financial needs.

### Example Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out to 15% if possible, focusing on low-cost index funds.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the limit; consider Roth for tax-free growth.
- **Taxable Account**: Use for emergency funds and short-term goals.

### Conclusion
Consult a financial advisor to tailor your distribution plan to your specific situation. Regularly review and adjust as circumstances change.
