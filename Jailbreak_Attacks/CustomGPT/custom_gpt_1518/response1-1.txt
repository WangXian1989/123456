Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, always aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider any additional investments in a taxable account. This is especially true for short-term goals and investments that might generate a lot of capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of where you invest, ensure you have a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Age and Goals Matter**: Younger investors often benefit from aggressive growth investments (like stocks), while those closer to retirement may want to focus on preserving capital (bonds, for example).

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: As market conditions change, be sure to revisit and adjust your allocations accordingly to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances!
