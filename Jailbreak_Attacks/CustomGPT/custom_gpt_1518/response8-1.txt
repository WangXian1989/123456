The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match before directing funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are often tax-deductible. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, which can be advantageous for investments held long-term.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account. This ensures you donâ€™t have to liquidate investments in a downturn.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may prefer to invest more heavily in stocks for growth, while those nearing retirement may prioritize more stable investments.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your target asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Everyone's financial situation is different, and meeting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a balanced portfolio that aligns with your long-term financial objectives while considering tax implications and risk tolerance.
