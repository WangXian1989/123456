Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively requires a strategic approach to optimize tax efficiency, growth potential, and financial goals. Here are some key considerations to guide your allocation:

1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Usually offers tax-deferred growth, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals, not contributions. Many employers match contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth):** 
     - Traditional IRAs are also tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - Contribution limits and income thresholds may affect your eligibility for Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes and dividends are taxed in the year they are received but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match first, as this is an immediate return on investment.
   - If you are eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts to pay taxes now at a lower rate.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more beneficial to defer taxes until you withdraw in retirement.

4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep higher-return investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts and more stable investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to balance risk and tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance, financial goals, and changes in your personal situation (e.g., marriage, job change, retirement plans).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor an investment strategy specific to your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy might vary based on individual circumstances, but following these guidelines can help you optimize your financial growth and tax efficiency.
