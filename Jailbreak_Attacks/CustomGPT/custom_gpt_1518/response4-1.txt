When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, including tax implications, contribution limits, withdrawal rules, and your overall financial goals. Here are some steps to help guide your distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Next, consider your IRA (Individual Retirement Account). Depending on your income and eligibility, you can contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) accounts ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older). Ensure you do not exceed these limits.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Investments:**
   - When choosing investments, consider placing high-growth assets (such as stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains. Conversely, more tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to minimize taxable income.

4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts have mandatory distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73, while Roth IRAs do not have RMDs during the account holder's lifetime. Consider these rules when planning withdrawals to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Align your investment choices with your risk tolerance and time horizon. If you're many years from retirement, you might opt for a more aggressive growth strategy in your tax-advantaged accounts, while taking a more conservative approach in taxable accounts.

6. **Maintain an Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses without having to pull from your retirement savings or incur penalties.

7. **Reassess and Rebalance Annually:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust as needed based on changes in your situation, market conditions, or retirement plans.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing your savings for both growth and tax efficiency. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances and goals.
