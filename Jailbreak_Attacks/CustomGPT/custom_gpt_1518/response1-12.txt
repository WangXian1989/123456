I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for any liver problems. They can provide personalized advice based on your condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, medical procedures, depending on the specific liver issue you're facing. Always seek professional guidance for health concerns.
