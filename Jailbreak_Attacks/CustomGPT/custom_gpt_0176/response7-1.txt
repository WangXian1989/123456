It's important to consider several factors when determining how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies for effective allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Generally, it's beneficial to hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA), while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

3. **Contributions by Priority**: After maximizing your employer match, consider funding your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. After maxing out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) if you have additional funds to invest.

4. **Diversification and Risk Management**: Ensure that your overall portfolio remains diversified across all accounts. Review your asset allocation and risk tolerance, and make adjustments as necessary.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. Having a mix might allow you to manage your tax bracket more effectively during withdrawals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal financial goals and circumstances vary greatly, so it can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Always ensure that your plan aligns with your long-term goals and is adaptable as your financial situation changes.
