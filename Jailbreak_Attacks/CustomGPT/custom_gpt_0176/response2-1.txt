The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is a beneficial strategy.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or non-deductible with tax-free growth (Roth). A Roth IRA can be particularly advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, but they provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider the nature of the investments you hold:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these investment accounts to cover unexpected expenses without needing to dip into your retirement savings.

6. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before aggressively investing, as the interest costs may outweigh potential investment returns.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investments and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances, helping you optimize your investment strategy and tax implications.

It's important to align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.
