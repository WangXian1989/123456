When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in your peak earning years.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax considerations. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider the Tax Implications of Each Account**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax; taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but with additional flexibility in investment choices. Depending on the type of IRA, withdrawals may be tax-free (Roth) or taxed (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Allocate Based on Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments to ensure liquidity and minimize tax burdens.
   - **Investment Goals**: Align the account distributions with short-term and long-term goals, ensuring that funds for expenses in the near future are easily accessible in taxable accounts.

By strategically distributing funds among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and investment growth over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your personal financial landscape.
