I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options. However, I can provide some general information on common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugar can help your liver function better.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve overall liver health.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for those with liver problems.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and determine the effectiveness of the treatment plan.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgical options may be necessary, such as removing damaged tissue or, in the case of liver failure, a liver transplant.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative medicine. However, you should always discuss these options with your physician first.

Since liver problems can vary widely in scope and severity, make sure to follow up with a healthcare provider for a comprehensive treatment plan that's right for you.
