It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively allocate your investment accounts! Here's a simple breakdown of how to approach distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Look for low-fee options.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: 
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) is better for your tax situation.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if possible for tax advantages.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Diversification**: Consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds. Tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs can be beneficial here.
   - **Liquidity**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals, so keep some funds available for short-term needs.

### General Distribution Strategy
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out IRA contributions (especially if you qualify for Roth).
- Invest additional funds in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient funds and strategies.

### Final Tips
- Rebalance regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- Consider your time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax implications when making investment choices.
