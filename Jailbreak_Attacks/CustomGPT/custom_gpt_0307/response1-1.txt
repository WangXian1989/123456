Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize these for investments that generate lower taxable income, like long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. This can provide liquidity without immediate tax consequences.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Similar to your 401(k), but you may have more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider high-growth stocks, ETFs, or low-cost index funds that can appreciate over time.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize safer investments within your 401(k) and IRA.
   - In taxable accounts, consider maintaining a mix of growth and income-generating assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on market conditions and personal financial changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
