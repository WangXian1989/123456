The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Think about putting higher-risk investments here for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions can reduce your taxable income, similar to a 401(k).
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Itâ€™s a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
  
3. **Diversification**: Distribute investments across different account types to take advantage of tax benefits while maintaining a diversified portfolio.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need before retirement. Investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains are generally more tax-efficient in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and rebalance at least annually to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Future Taxes**: Consider how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Balancing pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) and post-tax (Roth IRA) accounts can provide flexibility.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 20-30%
