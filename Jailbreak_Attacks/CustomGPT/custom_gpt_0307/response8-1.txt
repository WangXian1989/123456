The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize IRAs:** If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for the potential tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may have high turnover or taxable income, as these can be less tax-efficient in retirement accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts but tailor your asset allocation based on tax efficiency:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts if they are less tax-efficient.

5. **Review Regularly:** Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help you create a tailored approach based on your specific situation.
