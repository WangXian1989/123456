To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to these accounts first, especially if your employer offers a match on the 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term**: Prioritize retirement accounts for long-term growth. 
   - **Short-Term**: Keep more liquid investments in taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergencies.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusted by the specific tax implications of each type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan when to withdraw from each account to minimize taxes during retirement. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and aim to maximize them if possible.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy based on personal financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and goals.

By following these principles, you can optimize your investment distribution for growth and tax efficiency.
