1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Anti-inflammatory drugs**: To reduce liver inflammation in conditions like fatty liver disease.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - **Liver transplant**: For severe liver damage or failure.
   - **Endoscopic procedures**: To address complications like varices.

4. **Monitoring and Support**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.
