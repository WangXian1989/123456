To optimize your investment strategy, consider these key points:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to benefit from employer matching and tax-deferred growth. Aim for at least the employer match percentage.

2. **IRA**: Utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax deductions, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impacts.

Diversify assets across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon while regularly reviewing your allocations.
