When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages, and your investments can grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (traditional).

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and contributing to IRAs, continue contributing to your 401(k). The 401(k) typically has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, though you will owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, consider diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance. Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. 

6. **Regularly Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation and retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specifically for your needs. 

Overall, the goal is to balance tax advantages, potential growth, and your personal financial situation.
