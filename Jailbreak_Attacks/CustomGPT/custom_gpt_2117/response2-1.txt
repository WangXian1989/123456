Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Once youâ€™ve secured your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. This includes stocks or ETFs. Keep interest-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) may be more beneficial for immediate tax deductions. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, Roth accounts may be better.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Long-term Growth**: Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider risk tolerance and how long until you'll need to access the funds. Stocks may be suitable for longer horizons, while bonds may be better for shorter timeframes.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocations and rebalance if necessary to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
