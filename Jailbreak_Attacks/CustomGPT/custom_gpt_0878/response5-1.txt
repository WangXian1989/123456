To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions first, as this is essentially "free money." Additionally, contributions are tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds needed in the short term or for tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs that generate lower capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) (subject to annual limits) and IRA before using taxable accounts. In 2023, the limit for 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Type**:
   - Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as their tax benefits compound over time. Use taxable accounts for bonds or income-generating assets, which can lead to higher tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. Look at the overall portfolio rather than individual accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications on withdrawals: prioritize tax-deferred accounts for longer-term growth and consider a mix for retirement income.

Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
