To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and withdrawal flexibility.

### 2. **Diversify Investment Types**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for investments you may need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments**: Focus on growth assets (stocks) in 401(k) and IRA accounts since they benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Short-Term Investments**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid, stable investments (bonds, cash equivalents).

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market performance and your changing financial goals.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution for both growth and tax efficiency.
