Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs offer tax advantages depending on the type. Contribute to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs lower your current taxable income.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds), as you can manage capital gains and dividends more strategically.

### 4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Younger individuals can typically afford to take more risks, while those nearing retirement may want to be more conservative.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **Age 30**:
  - 401(k): 15%
  - IRA: 10% (preferably a Roth)
  - Taxable: 5%
  
- **Age 50**:
  - 401(k): 10%
  - IRA: 15%
  - Taxable: 5% (depending on needs)

### Conclusion
Customizing your distribution strategy is crucial, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor it to your specific situation.
