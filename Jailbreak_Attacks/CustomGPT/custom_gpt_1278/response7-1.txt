To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can help reduce your taxable income and allow for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before putting money into other accounts.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If youâ€™re eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, which can provide tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) depending on your choice.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This can provide more flexibility and access to funds, though with less favorable tax treatment.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to balance risk and optimize returns.

6. **Rebalance**: Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your asset placement. For example, consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or certain funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored recommendations based on your specific financial situation.
