Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a vital step in retirement planning. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

### **Outline for Distributing Funds**

1. **Understand Account Types**  
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account; often includes matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; consider Traditional vs. Roth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts; no tax advantages but provide flexibility.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**  
   - Short-term vs. long-term goals.
   - Anticipated retirement age and lifestyle.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**  
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Taxes are paid upon withdrawal (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - **Tax-Free Accounts**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Investments**: Pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Consider Investment Diversification**  
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - Adjust based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Prioritize Contributions**  
   - Max out 401(k) contributions to get employer match.
   - Contribute to an IRA, depending on type (Traditional or Roth).
   - Invest in taxable accounts for additional growth and liquidity.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**  
   - Monitor performance and reallocate as needed.
   - Adjust contributions based on income changes or life events.

### **Suggested Distribution Approach**

- **401(k)**: Maximize to the employer match (typically around 5-6% of your salary).
- **IRA**: Use the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 for under 50, $7,500 for 50+ in 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Conclusion**

Tailor the distribution to align with your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.
