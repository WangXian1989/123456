To provide an informed answer, I'll first outline key factors to consider before making your investment distribution decisions:

### **Outline for Distribution Strategy:**

1. **Understand Account Types**  
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account, also tax-advantaged.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Fully taxable; any gains are subject to capital gains tax.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Review annual contribution limits for each account type.

3. **Assess Individual Goals**
   - Retirement age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Immediate vs. deferred taxation impacts.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Balance between stocks, bonds, and other assets.

### **Distribution Recommendations:**

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**  
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match before focusing on other accounts.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Balance Allocation**  
   - Invest in growth-oriented assets (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts for higher tax efficiency.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) to minimize immediate tax impacts.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**  
   - Younger investors may prefer higher equity exposure for growth.
   - Older investors should shift towards bonds or income-generating assets as retirement nears.

### **Sample Distribution Strategy**:
- **401(k)**: Up to contribution limit + employer match â†’ 50% in equities, 50% in bonds.
- **IRA**: Max contribution â†’ 70% in equities, 30% in alternative investments (if eligible).
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining funds â†’ 60% in dividend-paying stocks, 40% in fixed income.
