(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, consider investing excess funds in taxable accounts for short-term goals or liquidity needs. These accounts are more flexible but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

Be sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer is offering a match, you absolutely want to scoop that up firstâ€”itâ€™s like leaving free money on the table if you donâ€™t! Aim to hit that match level, then crank up your contributions if you can swing it. 
2. **IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. If youâ€™re eligible for a Roth, go for it! Tax-free withdrawals later? Sign me up! Load that thing up every year until you hit the max.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, if youâ€™ve got some extra cash flow, toss it into taxable accounts. They're great for flexibility, but watch out for those taxes on dividends and gainsâ€”they can sneak up on ya! 

The golden rule? Diversify, keep an eye on your tax situation, and donâ€™t forget to re-evaluate your game plan regularly. It's all about playing the long game, baby!
