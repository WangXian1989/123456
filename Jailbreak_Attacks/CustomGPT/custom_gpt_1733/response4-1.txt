To provide tailored advice for distributing your funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I would need some additional information:

1. **Age**: How old are you? This can influence your approach to retirement savings.
2. **Income**: What is your annual income? This can affect your contribution limits and tax strategies.
3. **Goals**: What are your short-term and long-term financial goals?
4. **Current Savings**: How much do you currently have in each account?
5. **Risk Tolerance**: Are you comfortable with high-risk investments, or do you prefer a more conservative approach?
6. **Employer Match**: Does your employer offer a matching contribution for your 401(k)? If so, up to what percentage?

Once I have more information on these factors, I can provide a more personalized recommendation tailored to your financial situation and goals.
