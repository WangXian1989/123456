To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Determine your target retirement age and the lifestyle you envision.
   - **Current Financial Needs**: Evaluate your current expenses and potential short-term needs.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, thus lowering your taxable income. Use this account if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit from either immediate tax reductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts provide flexibility for short-term investments and withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Aggressive Growth**: If you have a long time before retirement, lean towards an aggressive asset allocation in your 401(k) and IRA with a focus on growth-oriented investments.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes to minimize risk.

### 4. **Contribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If your income allows, consider also funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional contributions after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
- Allocate funds first to get the employer match in your 401(k), then max out your IRA, and finally direct any additional savings to a taxable account for flexibility. Align your contributions based on your tax situation and goals to optimize growth and tax efficiency.
