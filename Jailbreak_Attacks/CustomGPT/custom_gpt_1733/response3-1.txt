Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for maximizing your retirement savings and minimizing your tax burden. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you allocate your funds:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often includes matching contributions. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be either a Traditional IRA (with tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (where contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell assets for a profit. They offer more flexibility but don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match; this is essentially free money. The 2023 contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to your IRA; the annual limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can offer significant tax benefits in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Determine your current and anticipated future tax brackets. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, contributing more to a Roth IRA might be beneficial since withdrawals during retirement won't be taxed.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions (like 401(k) or Traditional IRA).

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Choose a diversified mix of investments that reflect your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. For long-term growth, you might allocate more toward stocks, whereas for stable income, bonds might be preferable.
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals.

5. **Withdrawals Planning**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue to grow.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) that apply to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide insights on tax strategies and investment options.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ultimately supporting your financial independence in retirement.
