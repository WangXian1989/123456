The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) at least to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize your IRA contribution if you can’t max out both. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with a longer horizon or after-tax contributions. This can include stocks, ETFs, and other liquid assets.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. Stocks might go into taxable accounts for lower long-term capital gains taxes, while bonds could be held in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for market changes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Consult with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy tailored to your specific situation.
