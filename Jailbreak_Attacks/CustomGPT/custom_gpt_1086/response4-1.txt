Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to IRAs (Traditional or Roth) because of their tax advantages. Depending on your income, a Roth IRA might be preferable for tax-free growth.

3. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maxing out retirement accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged options. This can provide flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically, especially as your financial situation or goals change.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
