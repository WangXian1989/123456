The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA next. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you're not eligible for a Roth IRA or want to reduce your taxable income now, contribute to a traditional IRA.

4. **Finish 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maximized your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can be useful for short-term goals and provide more liquidity.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

7. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment choices, especially in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

8. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on life changes, market conditions, and goals.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
