Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first—it's free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your match, focus on your IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is great for tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible, although capital gains taxes apply.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:** Consider how much risk you’re willing to take. Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts for diversification.

5. **Regular Contributions:** Make consistent contributions to all accounts, adjusting based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically:** Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and adjust as necessary.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
