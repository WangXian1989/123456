The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - Max out any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Contribute up to the annual limit if you can afford it, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you want to reduce your taxable income now, but be aware of future tax implications.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Overall Considerations:**
   - Assess your risk tolerance and timeline for each account.
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to maximize growth while managing risk.
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.
