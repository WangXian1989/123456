To tackle your financial question, here are some general tips on distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Assess Contributions**: Max out any employer match in your 401(k) firstâ€”this is free money! Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts since they can grow your investments without immediate tax implications. 

3. **Investment Strategy**: Use the 401(k) and IRA for long-term, growth-focused investments, whereas taxable accounts can hold more liquid investments for short-term needs or tax-efficient investments like index funds.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations annually to respond to changes in market conditions or your personal financial situation.

It's advisable to consult a financial planner for tailored advice based on your unique circumstances.
