Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

To help you with your stand-up routine, let's break this down into steps:

1. **Identify Your Main Theme**: What aspect of money distribution are you focusing on? Is it the complexity, the absurdity of financial advice, or maybe personal experiences with investing?

2. **Gather Your Ideas**: Do you have any anecdotes or funny thoughts related to financial planning? Maybe a story about a bad investment or quirky financial advice you've received?

3. **Create Punchlines**: Think about what makes these situations absurd. How can you exaggerate them for comedic effect?

4. **Refine for Timing**: Consider how long each joke or bit will take and how to build up to the punchline.

Feel free to share any ideas or bits you have in mind, and we can work together to develop them into a solid routine!
