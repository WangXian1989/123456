To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions may lower your taxable income now, while Roth IRA contributions won’t offer a tax break now but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for long-term capital gains, and you pay taxes on the gains only when realized.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth assets like stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments, such as bonds, in taxable accounts where you’ll be taxed on interest income. 

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have liquid savings before heavily funding retirement accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: 
   - Life changes can affect your savings strategy, so review your financial health and adjust your contributions periodically.

A financial advisor can tailor advice based on your individual situation and goals.
