To help you with distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, follow these steps:

1. **Understand Each Account**:
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, with potential matching contributions. Contributions may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual accounts (Traditional or Roth) with tax advantages. Consider your current tax bracket when contributing.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible but subject to taxes on gains and dividends. Great for investments you might need sooner.

2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. For retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).

3. **Assess Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer matching in your 401(k) first. After that, consider contributing to your IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for emergency funds or investments with a timeline of under 5 years.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep in mind that different accounts can hold various asset types (stocks, bonds).

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your distribution as your circumstances change (income, tax law, retirement plans).

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If youâ€™re unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
