I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Diet: Emphasize a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and saturated fats.
   - Exercise: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments for blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver health.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol should be managed effectively to reduce liver strain.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative treatments, but it's crucial to consult with a healthcare provider before trying these.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized assessment and treatment plan.
