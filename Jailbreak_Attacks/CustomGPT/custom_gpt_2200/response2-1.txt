When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, start by contributing enough to get the full matchâ€”itâ€™s free money!

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: If you opt for a Roth IRA, contributions are post-tax, leading to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; these can affect your overall returns.

3. **Balance Your Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to at least the match, then consider contributing to your IRA (traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, add extra savings to taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing; 3-6 months' worth of expenses is a good rule of thumb.

5. **Strategy Based on Age**:
   - **Younger Investors**: More aggressive growth strategies in taxable accounts can be good; focus on long-term growth.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Shift towards more conservative investments, especially in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust as needed based on changes in your income, expenses, or life goals.

For a personalized strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can assess your unique situation.
