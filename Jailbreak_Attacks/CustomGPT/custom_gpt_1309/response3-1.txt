The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors including your age, investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). This can provide additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you tax deductions now.

3. **Pay Attention to Tax Implications**: If you have already maxed out your contributions in your 401(k) and IRA, then consider putting additional funds into a taxable account. However, be mindful of the tax implications of the investments you choose in this account.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If your focus is long-term growth, you might want to allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes and consider your risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Re-evaluation**: As your financial situation changes (like your income level, tax bracket, or financial goals), reassess your distribution strategy periodically.

It's generally advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.
