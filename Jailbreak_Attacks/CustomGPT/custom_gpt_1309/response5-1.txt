(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax bracket, investment goals, and time horizon. Generally, a good strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like the 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits. Consider contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, and then prioritize funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Any additional funds can go into your taxable account. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can also help manage risk and provide a balance of tax treatment.

After that, look into your IRA; if you can snag a Roth IRA, that's golden for tax-free withdrawals later. Finally, your taxable account is like the wild westâ€”flexibility galore! Just remember, money in a taxable account gets taxed on gains, so be smart about those investments. The sweet spot is to keep a mix that suits your risk tolerance and investment goals. Donâ€™t forget to sprinkle in some fun investments outside the retirement accountsâ€”itâ€™s all about balance and some thrill!
