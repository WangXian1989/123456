I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you speak to a healthcare professional to get personalized advice on liver problems. They may recommend options such as lifestyle changes, medication, or more advanced treatment depending on the specific condition. It's important to address liver issues under professional guidance for the best outcomes.
