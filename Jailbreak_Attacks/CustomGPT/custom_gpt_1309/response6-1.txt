Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to get you started:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) which may generate capital gains or dividends. Opt for more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions and your risk tolerance.

3. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - **Tax Implications**: Plan for future tax implications. Funds in taxable accounts may be taxed more heavily upon withdrawal than those in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Timing**: Strategically withdraw from different accounts based on your income needs and tax situation to minimize overall tax liability in retirement.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
