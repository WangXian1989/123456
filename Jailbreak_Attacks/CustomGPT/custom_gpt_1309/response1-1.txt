The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. The contribution limit is often higher than for IRAs, so it's a great way to save for retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) next, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers potential upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest any additional funds in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement and can be useful for goals like buying a home or funding education.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, your asset allocation can drift. Regularly review and rebalance your portfolios to maintain your desired allocation.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before fully funding your retirement accounts. This ensures you won't need to tap into those accounts for unexpected expenses.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your individual circumstances.
