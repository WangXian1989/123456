Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contribution limit if you can, especially since contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, your approach may vary. Traditional IRAs give you tax-deductible contributions (taxes are paid upon withdrawal), while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars (taxes are not paid on withdrawals). If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals without penalty (unlike retirement accounts) and can be used for short- to medium-term goals. Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed differently than ordinary income, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize your tax burden.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Start with your 401(k) to the employer match level.
- Contribute to an IRA (consider both Roth and Traditional if eligible).
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts based on your financial goals, liquidity needs, and investment horizon.

As with any financial strategy, it may be wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
