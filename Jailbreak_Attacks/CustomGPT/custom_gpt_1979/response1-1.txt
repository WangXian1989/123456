When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the key is to consider your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a practical breakdown:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money. Try to maximize your contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket; contributions can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (which provides tax deductions upfront) or a Roth IRA (which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you want to maximize tax advantages, balancing between the two types based on your income levels and expected retirement tax scenario is wise.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investing beyond your retirement accounts. They offer increased flexibility and can be instrumental for short-term goals or if you want to access your money before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; prioritize investments that yield qualified dividends or long-term gains for tax efficiency.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize getting the full 401(k) match.
- Max out your IRA options if you can.
- Allocate any extra funds into taxable accounts or use for other investment strategies, keeping your tax situation in mind.

It often helps to consult a financial advisor to tailor this approach based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
