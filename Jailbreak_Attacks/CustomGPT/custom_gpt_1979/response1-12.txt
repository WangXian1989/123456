I'm not a doctor, but I can offer you some general information about liver health and treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet modifications, regular exercise, and weight management can make a significant difference in liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol consumption is contributing to liver issues, abstaining from alcohol is often one of the first recommendations.

4. **Managing Chronic Conditions**: Conditions like diabetes and high cholesterol can affect liver health, so managing these is crucial.

5. **Regular Monitoring**: Ongoing evaluations through blood tests and imaging can help track liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment for your specific situation. Take care!
