I'm not a doctor, but it's really important to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options can vary greatly depending on the specific condition you have. Generally, they might include lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms or underlying issues, and in more severe cases, procedures like liver transplant. Always reach out to a medical professional for guidance tailored to your situation.
