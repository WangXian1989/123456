Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a strategic decision that depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Here's a practical approach to consider:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has tax advantages. Contributions reduce your taxable income. Employer matches are a big plus, so aim to at least contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax-deferred growth. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't have tax advantages but allow for more flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalty and invest in a broad range of assets.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Focus on getting the maximum employer match in your 401(k) first—it's essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the limits are $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - Once you’ve contributed enough to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into your taxable account.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep in mind that different accounts might have different tax implications. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Higher-growth investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), whereas more stable or income-generating investments may be better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy to align it with your changing financial situation and goals. Rebalancing your portfolio can help maintain your desired level of risk and ensure you’re on track for retirement.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best allocation, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture.

In summary, prioritize employer matches, then maximize your IRA contributions, and finally, allocate to your taxable account as additional savings allow.
