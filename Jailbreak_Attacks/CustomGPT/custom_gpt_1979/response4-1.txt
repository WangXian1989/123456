Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic process, tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to approach it:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA (income limits apply), it can be beneficial for tax-free growth. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, if you have additional funds, consider contributing more to your 401(k), especially if you haven't reached the contribution limit for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds that exceed your retirement contributions can go into a taxable account. These accounts can offer flexibility, allowing you to access your money without penalties and providing tax-efficient investment options, such as index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversifying your investments is crucial. Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and life events. Adjust contributions to reflect these changes.

Using a blend of these accounts can maximize your tax advantages while preparing for your financial future. Consulting a financial advisor for a tailored strategy might also be beneficial.
