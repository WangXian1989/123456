When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you with this decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that benefit. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed at your ordinary income rate.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Contributions to a Traditional IRA can be tax-deductible; withdrawals in retirement are taxed. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when you sell assets for a profit, as well as taxes on dividends and interest.

3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to mitigate risks.

4. **Retirement Timeline**: Consider how close you are to retirement. The closer you are, the more you might want to shift toward conservative investments to preserve capital.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts can provide more liquidity than retirement accounts, which can be locked until retirement age without incurring penalties. If you anticipate needing funds for short-term goals, ensure you have enough liquid assets.

6. **Investment Choices**: Look at the investment options available in each account. Some 401(k) plans have limited choices, while IRAs and taxable accounts generally allow a broader selection of investments.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**: As the market changes, your asset allocation may shift. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, it may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor to tailor an approach that fits your specific situation and objectives.

By balancing these factors, you can create an effective strategy for distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
