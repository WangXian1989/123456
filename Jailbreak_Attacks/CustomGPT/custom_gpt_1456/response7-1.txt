Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax considerations, and your time horizon for needing the funds. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money. The 401(k) is tax-deferred which means you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it, usually in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth similar to a 401(k), while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have contributed enough to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider putting extra funds into a taxable account. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals before retirement age, and you can also take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.

A balanced approach considering your unique circumstances, such as income level, retirement goals, and tax situation, is often best. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that aligns with your overall financial plan.
