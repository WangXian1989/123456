When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investment:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Always try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. After that, consider funding your IRA up to the maximum limit.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals will be taxed as income during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax benefits, but you may have certain income limits that affect your contribution deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices. Plan for capital gains taxes here.

3. **Investment Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance, you might want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts, where you won’t be taxed on capital gains until you withdraw, while keeping more stable investments (like bonds) in your taxable account.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a savings account before maximizing investments, as this can help avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify**: Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and market conditions.

Finally, consider talking with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation, as they can provide insights that fit your long-term goals.
