(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, a good strategy involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. You might consider these steps:

1. **Maximize employer match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
3. **Continue contributions to your 401(k)**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing more to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable accounts for additional savings**: If you have excess funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in a taxable brokerage account, which offers more flexibility but is subject to capital gains taxes.

Itâ€™s important to evaluate your overall financial situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
