Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. These can lower your taxable income and help your investments grow tax-deferred.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily funding your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, draw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k)), and finally from tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances by consulting a financial advisor.

Assess your individual situation regularly to adjust your contributions as needed!
