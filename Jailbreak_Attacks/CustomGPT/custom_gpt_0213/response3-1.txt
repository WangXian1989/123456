To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out contributions if you can, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals. Use a traditional IRA if you need tax deductions now.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account for easy access.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax burdens on interest income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk and returns.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts, especially in retirement. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
