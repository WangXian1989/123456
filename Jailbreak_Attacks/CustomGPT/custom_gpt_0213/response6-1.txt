To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) contribution, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Evaluate your current and expected future tax rates to decide which is best.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you need liquidity. This includes stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Decide on a diversified asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. This will help balance growth and risk across all account types.

4. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for the order of withdrawals in retirement: generally, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (IRAs if Roth).

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions** to retirement accounts to maximize tax benefits.
- **Diversify investments** across account types while keeping an eye on your overall financial goals.
