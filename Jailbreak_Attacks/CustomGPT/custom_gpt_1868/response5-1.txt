To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your traditional or Roth IRA contributions (depending on your eligibility). These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

2. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional 401(k) or IRA may be more beneficial since contributions can lower your taxable income. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan how you would withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it's wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation, goals, and market conditions may change. Regularly review and adjust your allocations accordingly.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance and ensure youâ€™re optimizing your investments based on your unique circumstances.
