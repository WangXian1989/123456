The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, maximize your contributions to at least that level. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can hold investments that you may want to sell before retirement. Choose investments with favorable tax treatments (e.g., long-term capital gains).
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider holding bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk**
   - Ensure that your overall investment allocation is diversified according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments across all account types.

### 4. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**
   - Consistently contribute to all accounts, and periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

### 5. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity**
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund outside your investment accounts to avoid the need to withdraw from your 401(k) or IRA prematurely.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
