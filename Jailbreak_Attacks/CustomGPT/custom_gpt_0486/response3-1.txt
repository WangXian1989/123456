The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Evaluate Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and projected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, prioritize Roth accounts due to their tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you believe your income will decrease, Traditional accounts may be more advantageous since you can deduct contributions now at a higher rate.

4. **401(k) Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA and your employer match, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This will allow you to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within each type of account are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This might mean adjusting asset allocation more frequently in your taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

Each individual's situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
