When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the strategy largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guiding principles:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you believe your tax rate will be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect higher taxes when you retire.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they offer no immediate tax benefits, they allow for flexibility and can be more advantageous for shorter-term goals, as you pay capital gains tax rather than ordinary income tax upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Analyze Your Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Funds needed in the next few years should be kept in taxable accounts or cash equivalents.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts for longer-term growth with compound interest.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and return. 

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Periodic reviews of your asset allocation and account contributions are essential. Adjust based on performance, changing financial situations, and nearing retirement.

### Sample Distribution Strategy
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions if feasible.
- Any remaining funds can go into your taxable accounts to ensure liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy specific to your circumstances, ensuring alignment with your overall financial goals.
