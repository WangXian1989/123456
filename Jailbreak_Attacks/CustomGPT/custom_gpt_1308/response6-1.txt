When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies for optimal tax efficiency and growth potential:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, based on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in assets that have favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Use tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Allocate more conservative investments in taxable accounts to limit immediate tax exposure.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals based on your tax bracket to minimize tax impacts, drawing from taxable accounts first in retirement.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments in each account to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk profile.

Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and the current tax landscape when implementing these strategies.
