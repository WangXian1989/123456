I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment options. Generally, treatment for liver issues may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or, in severe cases, procedures or surgery. Depending on the specific liver condition, your doctor may recommend alternatives such as:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet changes, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver problem, medications may be prescribed to help manage the condition.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping regular appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and overall health.
4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In certain severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

It's crucial to have a thorough discussion with your doctor, who can offer guidance based on your unique health needs.
