To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account has specific contribution limits. In 2023, for example, you can contribute up to $22,500 to your 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). 

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts**: The 401(k) and IRA provide tax deferment on your investments until withdrawal. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, these could be prioritized.
   - **Taxable accounts**: These accounts can be beneficial if you need liquidity or have short-term financial goals, but they do not offer tax advantages.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, equities are favorable for growth, while bonds can provide stability. Spread investments suited to your risk tolerance across your accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your financial situation. 

6. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments not just within each account, but across them as well, mitigating risks related to asset classes.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan how you will withdraw from these accounts to maximize tax efficiency. 

Putting together a detailed plan may require consulting with a financial advisor, especially if you're unsure about how to align your investments with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

### To foster deeper discussion, consider these questions:
1. What are your short-term and long-term financial goals?
2. How much risk are you willing to take with your investments?
3. Do you have any other investment accounts or assets outside of these three?
