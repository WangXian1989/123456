To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax benefits. For example, contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA can reduce your taxable income, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - Use your taxable account for investments that generate minimal taxable income, such as municipal bonds or long-term capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (plus an additional $7,500 if you're over 50), and for IRAs, it is $6,500 (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution available for those over 50).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals. Longer-term investments can go into more aggressive growth options within your 401(k) and IRA, while more conservative investments might be better suited for your taxable accounts if you need access to cash sooner.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of the account type. This mitigates risk and enhances potential returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in retirement. Generally, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing, and then draw from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s later to manage your tax brackets efficiently.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your investments to make sure you're maintaining your desired asset allocation, especially as market conditions change.

By considering these strategies and consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance, you can create an effective distribution plan for your retirement accounts.
