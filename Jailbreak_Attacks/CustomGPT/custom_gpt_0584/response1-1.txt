The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), it's usually wise to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Contributions to an IRA:** After maximizing your employer's match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great long-term investment, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversify with Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer flexibility since you can access your money without penalties (unlike early withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k)s). However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments when you sell.

4. **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or stocks), while holding tax-inefficient ones (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Over time, your asset allocation may drift from your original strategy due to varying performance of investments. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, it can be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can help create a personalized strategy tailored to your individual circumstances.

Ultimately, the right distribution for you will align with your retirement goals and financial situation.
