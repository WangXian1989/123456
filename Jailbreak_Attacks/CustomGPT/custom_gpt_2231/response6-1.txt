Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your current financial situation, tax bracket, and investment goals. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Balance Investment Growth and Liquidity**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may need to be liquidated sooner or for tax-efficient funds (like index funds) that minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access to funds.

### 4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket**: Higher earners may benefit from maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first to reduce taxable income.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on your investment performance and changing financial goals.

Implementing these strategies can enhance your overall return while minimizing tax liabilities. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your circumstances.
