Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Income and Tax Situation**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, great if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: The max contribution for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-term Goals**: Ideal for funds you might need in the near future.
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: You can withdraw at any time without penalties, and the investments can be more diverse.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough in cash or liquid assets for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to reduce risk.
- **Reevaluate Regularly**: Adjust contributions and allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor this approach to your specific situation.
