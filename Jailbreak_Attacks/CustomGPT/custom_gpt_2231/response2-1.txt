Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: If you qualify, contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - Contributions to a **Traditional IRA** and **401(k)** may reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA** contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Allocate Investments**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Consider holding higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow without immediate tax impacts.
   - **Bonds or Income-Producing Investments**: Consider placing these in taxable accounts if they generate taxable income, as you can offset taxes with lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account type to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically. Consider using taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually or when major life changes occur, adjusting as needed based on market conditions and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.
