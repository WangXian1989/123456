Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax; withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are taxed as capital gains, which can be more favorable than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Determine Your Time Horizon**: 
   - For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - For retirement (20+ years away), max out tax-advantaged accounts first.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Utilize different account types to balance tax exposure. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and investments that generate ordinary income in tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a liquid emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.
