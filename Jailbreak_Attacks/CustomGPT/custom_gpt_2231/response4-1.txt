The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility.

2. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributions to taxable accounts. This can be beneficial for flexibility and accessing funds before retirement age.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s will be taxed as ordinary income, while withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free if rules are followed.
   - Taxable accounts may be taxed on dividends and capital gains, making them less favorable for longer-term holdings but more flexible for early withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider the types of investments within each account. For example, it may be beneficial to hold higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes until withdrawal.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your investment performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific circumstances.

By considering these strategies, you can create a well-rounded distribution plan that supports your financial goals effectively.
