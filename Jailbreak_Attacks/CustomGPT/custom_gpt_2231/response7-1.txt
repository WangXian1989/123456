Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach to consider:

### General Principles

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money). Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while contributions to Traditional IRAs may be tax-deductible.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs lower your taxable income now, whereas Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains taxes (e.g., index funds, ETFs) or tax-efficient strategies.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate investments based on risk tolerance: stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds/fixed income in taxable accounts for income generation and stability.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer commitments should lean towards higher-risk investments. Short-term goals may need more conservative investments to ensure stability.
