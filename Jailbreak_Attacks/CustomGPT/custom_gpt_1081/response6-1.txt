When considering the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the unique characteristics, tax implications, and benefits of each account type. Below are some strategic considerations to help you make informed decisions:

### Understanding the Accounts
1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - Employer-sponsored retirement accounts.
   - Often have higher contribution limits.
   - Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing taxable income in the year contributed.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Both accounts have lower contribution limits compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Investment accounts where contributions are made with after-tax income.
   - Flexible in terms of withdrawal without penalty; however, capital gains taxes may apply on profits.

### Distribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.
- **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Consider paying down any high-interest debt before investing.
- **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
  - Place growth-oriented investments in your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
  - Use your 401(k) for large contributions, taking advantage of employer matches and tax deferral.
- **Fill Lower Tax Rates with Taxable Accounts**:
  - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate lower capital gains taxes, such as long-term investments or tax-efficient funds.

### Recommended Allocation
- **General Guideline**:
  - Contribute 15% of your income to retirement accounts initially, adjusting as needed based on goals and employer programs.
  - Use a mix of 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts based on immediate cash needs and long-term goals.
  
### Conclusion
A well-considered approach to distributing your money across these accounts can maximize tax efficiency and help you reach your financial goals. Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies specific to your situation. 

Always remember to regularly reassess your investment strategy as your financial situation and market conditions change.
