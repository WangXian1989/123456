Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Between Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Prioritize contributions here for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or if youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Options:** Diversify across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and consider your risk tolerance.

5. **Tax Implications:** Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed based on how long you've held the investment.

6. **Periodic Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocation to stay aligned with your goals and market changes.
