To optimize your investment strategy, consider these steps:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. Allocate contributions based on your risk tolerance, often leaning toward higher-growth options if you're younger.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Diversify within the IRA based on your investment goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate more income that could be taxed, like dividend stocks or short-term gains. Focus on low-turnover funds and consider tax-efficient strategies.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**: Balance your investments across these accounts to achieve your desired risk level, keeping in mind tax implications and withdrawal strategies.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations according to market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your particular needs.
