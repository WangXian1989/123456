1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: If your liver issue is related to viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
