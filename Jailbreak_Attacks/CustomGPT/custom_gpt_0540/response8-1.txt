The best way to allocate your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Look at the investment options within your 401(k). Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

2. **IRA Accounts** (Traditional and Roth):
   - **Tax Implications**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax bracket and expected future income, you might prefer one over the other.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions if possible (e.g., $6,500 for IRAs in 2024, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **Investing Strategy**: Similar to your 401(k), diversify among stocks and bonds, considering time horizon and risk appetite.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts are great for money you'll need before retirement. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Income-Producing Investments**: Consider investments that are tax-advantaged, like qualified dividends.

4. **Balanced Approach**:
   - Start with an aggressive allocation in your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, gradually adjusting to more conservative investments as you approach retirement age.
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, separate from your investment accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio at least annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult a financial planner, especially if you have complex financial situations or tax considerations.

Overall, a well-diversified approach tailored to your personal financial picture will likely yield the best long-term results.
