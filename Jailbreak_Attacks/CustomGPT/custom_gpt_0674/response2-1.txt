When considering the best way to distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your income level and tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income in the year you contribute.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Diversify Your Investment Strategy**: Both 401(k) and IRAs can be invested in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and do not have contribution limits like retirement accounts. They can be a good place to hold investments that may generate short-term capital gains or income, as you can manage the timing of your sales for tax efficiency.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs), in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest income. Conversely, consider holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds, in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Reevaluate Your Strategy Regularly**: As your income, tax situation, and financial goals change, revisit your distribution strategy to ensure it remains aligned with your objectives.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your personal situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By carefully considering how to allocate your contributions among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you can maximize your savings and investment growth while minimizing tax implications.
