I’m sorry to hear you're experiencing liver problems. It’s really important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition. Treatments can vary widely depending on the underlying cause of your liver issue, such as whether it’s due to hepatitis, fatty liver disease, alcohol-related damage, or other factors. 

General treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:** This includes adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol.
   
2. **Medications:** Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring:** Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests and check-ups.

4. **In severe cases:** Procedures like liver transplant might be considered if the liver is severely damaged.

Always make sure to have a detailed discussion with your doctor about the best course of action for you.
