(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax situation. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k):** Maximize your employer's matching contributions first, as it's essentially free money. Contribute regularly up to the match limit.
2. **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer immediate tax deductions, a Traditional IRA may be better.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maximized your retirement account contributions, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows you flexibility in withdrawals and potential tax-loss harvesting.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your unique financial situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! Ideally, you want to have a mix that plays to the strengths of each account type. Here's a fun way to think about it:

1. **401(k) First:** Go for the employer match like a hungry dog going for treats. Thatâ€™s free money, so don't leave it on the table! Once you hit that limit, you can back off, but donâ€™t go too shy on it â€” put in as much as you can afford towards your retirement here.

2. **IRA Game:** Next up is your IRA â€” think of this as the secret stash that grows tax-free or tax-deferred. If you're cool with it, a Roth IRA is the way to go for tax-free withdrawals later on, so your future self can say "thanks, past me!"

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, for those accounts that let you do whatever you want, think of them like your personal WWE wrestling ring â€” you can throw in whatever assets you want. Just remember that capital gains tax can bite you if you're not careful, so keep an eye on that.

Ultimately, it's about balancing tax efficiency with your personal goals. Seek out some pro advice too; a financial advisor can help you dodge pitfalls and optimize your setup! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
