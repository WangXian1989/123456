Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some strategies to consider when allocating your funds:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These should generally hold investments that generate fewer taxable events, such as tax-efficient index funds or ETFs. This way, you minimize taxes on capital gains and dividends.
   - **Asset Location Strategy:** Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and lower-growth or income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize your tax situation.

3. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Needs:** If you need liquidity in the short term, prioritize funding a taxable account. For long-term growth, maximize contributions to retirement accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Assess how much risk you're willing to take. If you're risk-averse, ensure a balanced approach across all accounts, whereas an aggressive investor may lean more heavily into stocks within retirement accounts.

By carefully evaluating your options and understanding your financial landscape, you can devise a strategy that lays the groundwork for a secure and prosperous financial future.
