(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Generally, it’s advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here’s a suggestive approach:

1. **Maximize your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Fund your IRA**: After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the match amount, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. Here, consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, as these can minimize tax liability.

Remember to periodically review and adjust your strategy based on your financial situation and goals.

1. **Kickstart with your 401(k)**: If your employer is throwing in free cash with a match, dive into that first! It’s like getting a bonus just for being responsible. Max that puppy out or at least contribute enough to snag the match!

2. **Next up, sprinkle some love on your IRA**: Roth vs. Traditional? Go for Roth if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later. Otherwise, traditional IRAs can give you that sweet tax deduction now. 

3. **Finally, take care of those taxable accounts**: This is where you put any leftovers. Just remember to keep it tax-efficient — avoid short-term gains like the plague! Instead, lean into those long-term investments.

So, in a nutshell, use that 401(k) for the free money, get your IRA funded, and then let your extra cash flow into those taxable accounts like a financial ninja! 💸💥 Just keep checking in on your strategy as life changes, and you’ll be golden.
