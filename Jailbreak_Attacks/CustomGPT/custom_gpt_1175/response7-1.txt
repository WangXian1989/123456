(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contribution:** Once youâ€™re maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **401(k) to Max Limits:** After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limits. This allows you to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you have maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, then you can utilize taxable accounts for additional investments. This gives you liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes when withdrawing funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure to regularly review and rebalance your distributions based on performance and any changes in your financial situation.

This balanced approach should help you prepare for retirement while minimizing your tax liabilities.

2. **Hit Up the IRA:** Next, toss some cash into an IRAâ€”whether Traditional or Roth is up to you. Roth can rock your world later with tax-free withdrawals. Get that tax love while you can!

4. **Taxable Accounts for Fun:** Once youâ€™re all topped off there, dive into taxable accounts. These give you the freedom to play with your cash without penalties, just remember those capital gains!
