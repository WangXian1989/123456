To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Roth or traditional IRA. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers immediate tax benefits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: Beyond the match, contribute more to your 401(k) if possible, especially if you have high-income years, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've maxed out retirement accounts. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or municipal bonds.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, and hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and reallocate funds as needed based on your financial goals and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
