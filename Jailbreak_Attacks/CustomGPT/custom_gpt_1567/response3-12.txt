I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver problem diagnosed. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through blood tests and imaging may be necessary for ongoing assessment.

4. **Surgery**: In more severe cases, surgical options may be considered, such as liver transplantation.

Always seek personalized medical advice from a healthcare provider for the best outcome.
