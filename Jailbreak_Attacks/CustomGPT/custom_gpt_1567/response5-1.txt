Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Max out contributions to these accounts if possible.

### 2. Evaluate Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest additional funds here. While you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, this account offers flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk and return. 

### 4. Consider Withdrawal Strategies
- Plan how you will withdraw funds during retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.

### 5. Regularly Reassess
- Review your distribution strategy annually or after significant life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

This approach aims to optimize growth potential while minimizing tax burdens. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
