Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out an IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Flexible Goals**: For any additional savings, use your taxable accounts. This gives you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making it suitable for shorter-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, ensure your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in accounts with longer timelines (like 401(k) or IRA), while keeping safer assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to funding your future. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
