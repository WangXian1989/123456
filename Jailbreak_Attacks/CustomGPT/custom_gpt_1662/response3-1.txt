The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions:** After maxing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, any additional savings can go into a taxable investment account. This offers more flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Investment Allocation:** Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors might take more risks with higher equity allocations, while those closer to retirement may prefer safer assets.

5. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Tax Considerations:** Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified Roth distributions are tax-free.

A well-balanced approach can help maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
