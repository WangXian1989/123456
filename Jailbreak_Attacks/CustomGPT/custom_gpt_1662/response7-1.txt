Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Next, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction on contributions.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:** After maxing out your IRA, if you can, increase contributions to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Finally, if you still have extra funds to invest, consider a taxable account. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Diversification:** Aim for a mix of accounts to provide flexibility in retirement, as withdrawing from different account types can minimize tax impacts.
