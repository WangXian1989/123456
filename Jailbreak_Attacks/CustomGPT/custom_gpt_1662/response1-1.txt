To optimize the distribution of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, ensure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money! ðŸŽ‰

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax advantages can be significant, especially for long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties, though be mindful of capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth. Keep interest-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as theyâ€™re taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting as needed.

This strategy balances tax efficiency with access and growth potential, helping you maximize your long-term wealth. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice! ðŸ’¼
