To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize employer match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Fund the IRA**: After securing the 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for the tax advantages they offer, including tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Return to the 401(k)**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) to continue adding funds until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable accounts**: After hitting the limits on tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to mitigate capital gains taxes.

5. **Adjust based on income**: Consider your current tax bracket and future income expectations. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

6. **Retirement timeline**: Your age and how far you are from retirement should influence your asset allocation and account prioritization.

By following this strategy, you can optimize tax efficiency and growth potential across your investment accounts. If you have specific numbers or goals, feel free to share, and I can help refine this further! ðŸš€
