I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized treatment options for your liver problem. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medication, or in some cases, procedures depending on the severity of your condition. Also, keep an eye on your diet and avoid alcohol, as these can significantly impact liver health. Please take care!
