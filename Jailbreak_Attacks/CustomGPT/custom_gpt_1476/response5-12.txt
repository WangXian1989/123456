I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and disease progression.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for tailored advice and treatment.
