I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, such as reducing alcohol intake, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), antiviral or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
