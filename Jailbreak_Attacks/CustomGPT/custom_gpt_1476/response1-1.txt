Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, since qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs are also beneficial for tax deductions now, but you’ll owe taxes on withdrawals later.
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) after the match, especially if your employer offers a traditional plan.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for investments. They can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk effectively.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and those with lower capital gains tax in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Life changes, so periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor is also a good idea to create a personalized plan based on your specific circumstances.
