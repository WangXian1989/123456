To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions first, as it often comes with employer matching.
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) next, keeping in mind their contribution limits.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient or for short-term goals.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.
   - Consider holding more volatile assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, a professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.

Always consider your individual tax situation and retirement goals when making these decisions.
