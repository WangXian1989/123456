I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that the best approach to liver problems typically involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and sometimes procedures. Generally, treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: This often includes adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods. Regular exercise is also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other medications to manage symptoms and reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare professional to monitor liver function through blood tests and imaging studies can help assess the condition over time.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Itâ€™s essential to consult with healthcare professionals to determine the best treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.

If you're looking for more personalized advice, I suggest you reach out to a medical professional who specializes in liver health. 

Take care!
