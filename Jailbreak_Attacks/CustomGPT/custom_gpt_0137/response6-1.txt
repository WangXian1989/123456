Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. Understand the Account Types:
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, and contributions may reduce taxable income. It's typically best for long-term retirement savings.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax deductions on contributions and tax-deferred growth. There are traditional and Roth options with different tax implications.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access but subject to capital gains taxes. Good for short-term goals and investments.

### 2. Strategies for Distribution:
- **Maximize Employer Matches**: Ensure at least enough contributions to your 401(k) to receive any employer matchâ€”this is essentially "free money."
- **Focus on Tax Efficiency**: 
  - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds).
  - Reserve taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income (like index funds).

### 3. General Allocation Advice:
- Start by maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if you receive a match.
- Contribute to an IRA, particularly if you're eligible for tax deductions.
- Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts, focusing on investments with favorable tax treatment.

Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changing financial situations, tax laws, and retirement goals.
