The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively "free money." If you're maximizing your employer match, consider increasing contributions as your budget allows, as 401(k)s have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**: A Roth IRA can be ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA may be better if you want tax deductions now. Depending on your income, your ability to contribute to these accounts may vary, so check the IRS guidelines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This flexibility allows for easier access to your funds without penalties, and you can invest in a broader range of assets. However, be mindful of potential capital gains taxes on earnings.

**Distribution Strategy**: 

- **Max Out Employer Matching**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the maximum employer match first.
  
- **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After employer matching, consider maximizing contributions to IRAs (either Roth or Traditional depending on your situation).

- **Taxable Accounts as a Supplement**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings, especially for shorter-term goals or if you foresee needing liquidity.

**Other Considerations**:

- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and goals in each account type. 

- **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs, or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice based on your personal financial situation.
