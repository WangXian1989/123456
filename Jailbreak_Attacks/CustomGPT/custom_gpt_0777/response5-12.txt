I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver treatment options. The best treatment often depends on the specific liver condition you have. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Implementing a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on your condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications or drugs to manage symptoms and prevent complications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging studies can help monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical options may be necessary, including liver transplant.

5. **Alternative Treatments**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies; however, these should be discussed with a healthcare provider to avoid adverse effects.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the most suitable treatment plan for your specific liver issue.
