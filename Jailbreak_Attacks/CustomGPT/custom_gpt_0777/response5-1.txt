Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (it's essentially free money).
   - If you can, max out your IRA contributions. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 per year ($7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (within 5 years), prioritize taxable accounts for flexibility.
   - For long-term goals, focus on your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Place higher-tax investments (e.g., bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from tax.
   - Hold income-generating assets in taxable accounts, as you might not be taxed until you sell them.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is appropriate for your risk tolerance. Diversifying across all accounts can help manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk and investment strategy.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
