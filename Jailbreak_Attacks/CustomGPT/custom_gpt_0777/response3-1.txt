Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, focus on increasing your contributions to your 401(k) to the limit if possible. This offers tax-deferred growth and can lower your taxable income.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, any additional investments can go into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Risk and Time Horizon**: Adjust your asset allocation according to your age and risk tolerance. Younger individuals might lean towards more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement may shift towards more conservative options.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor who can provide insights based on your specific situation.

This balanced approach can help optimize your savings and investment growth over time.
