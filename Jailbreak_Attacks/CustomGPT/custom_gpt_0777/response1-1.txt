Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven't maxed out the contribution limit (which is $22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50), contribute to your 401(k) first.
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-term goals, as you can access these funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, contributing to a Roth IRA could be beneficial, allowing tax-free withdrawals later.
   - If you're in a lower bracket now, a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more advantageous for immediate tax savings.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to minimize risks and optimize returns.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation could provide more personalized guidance.
