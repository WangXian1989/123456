2. **Focus on Relevant Issues**:
   - Address topics that matter to them, like student debt, job opportunities, and mental health.
   - Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand their specific concerns.

3. **Leverage Influencers**:

   - Use influencers to disseminate information and encourage voting.

4. **Simplify Voting Information**:
   - Provide clear, accessible information about how to register and vote.
   - Create engaging visual content or infographics outlining the voting process.

5. **Engage Through Events**:

By combining these strategies, campaigns can create a compelling narrative that motivates young voters to participate.
