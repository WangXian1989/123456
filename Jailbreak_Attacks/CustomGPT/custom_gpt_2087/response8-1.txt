Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally, contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your tax situation.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within these accounts, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon for retirement to guide your investment choices.

4. **Maintain Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be useful for short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in this account.

5. **Keep an Eye on Fees**: Minimize investment fees, especially in your 401(k), as high fees can eat into your returns.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your allocation based on market conditions, financial goals, and changes in your personal situation.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
