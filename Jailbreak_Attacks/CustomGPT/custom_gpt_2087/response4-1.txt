Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Both offer tax-deferred growth. Consider maxing these out first, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before allocating too much toward investments.

4. **Diversification**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like index funds or long-term capital gains. You can also hold bonds here since they are taxed at ordinary income rates.

5. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your goalsâ€”long-term growth may lean toward stocks, while shorter-term needs might necessitate more bonds or cash equivalents.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review your allocation across accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, a professional can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Consideration of your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and overall financial picture is crucial for making the most informed decision.
