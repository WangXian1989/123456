Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### Considerations for Allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Choose Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: These accounts provide tax deductions on contributions, reducing your taxable income. Prioritize these if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you have maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These may offer more flexibility and can be a source of funds for short- to medium-term goals.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Look for a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) in all accounts to spread risk effectively.

5. **Reevaluate Annually**: Regularly assess your allocation based on changes in income, financial goals, and market conditions.

### Example Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the match.
- Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible.
- Max out your 401(k) and/or Traditional IRA if possible.
- Invest in a taxable account for additional savings and flexibility.

This strategy helps optimize tax efficiency and prepare for retirement effectively. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
