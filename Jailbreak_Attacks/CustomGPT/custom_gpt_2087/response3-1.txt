Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is free money and an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Aim for the annual contribution limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 as of 2023; $7,500 for those 50 and older). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, while a traditional IRA may offer tax deductions.

3. **Continue with the 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds available, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This can be useful for short-term goals or when you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on market conditions, your risk tolerance, and life changes (like marriage, children, etc.).

6. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes, while IRAs and 401(k)s offer tax advantages during accumulation.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (max it to the employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to the contribution limit
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder after maxing out above options

### Additional Tips:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice may provide tailored guidance based on your unique situation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of contribution limits and tax laws as they can change. 

By following this strategy, you can optimize tax advantages and manage your investment growth effectively.
