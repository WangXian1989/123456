The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax/Such Contributions:** Consider the tax benefits of contributing pre-tax dollars if your 401(k) offers this option.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional:** Decide whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) or Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) aligns better with your tax strategy.
   - **Max Contributions:** Try to contribute the maximum allowed if possible, especially in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for expenses you anticipate needing to access before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains tax.

### General Strategy
1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:** Maximize contributions to 401(k)s and IRAs first for tax advantages.
2. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in case of emergencies.
3. **Diversify Investments:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

### Considerations
- **Investment Options:** Review the investment options and fees in each account type to make informed decisions.
- **Age and Time Horizon:** Your age and when you plan to retire can influence your investment strategy and risk tolerance.
