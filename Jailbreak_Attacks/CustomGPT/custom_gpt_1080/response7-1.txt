To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### Understanding Account Types
1. **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax advantages. Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax with Roth options), and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages to a 401(k), allowing for tax-deferred growth on investments. Traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax dollars, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts that do not offer tax advantages. Capital gains, dividends, and interest are taxed in the year they are realized.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to an IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Tailor your investment choices in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher risk might be acceptable for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA).
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering the overall risk.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at lower rates. Avoid high-turnover investments that generate short-term capital gains.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-deferred accounts (like stocks) and use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds).

4. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly assess the performance and tax implications across your accounts. Rebalance as needed to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### Summary
The best approach involves maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, diversifying investments according to your risk tolerance, maintaining tax efficiency, and regularly reviewing your allocations. This balanced approach can help you achieve your long-term financial goals while optimizing your tax situation. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
