When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider various factors including tax implications, investment goals, and your personal financial situation. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**
   - **401(k):**
     - Tax-deferred growth.
     - Often includes employer matching contributions.
     - Contribution limits (for 2023: $22,500, or $30,000 if age 50+).

   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):**
     - Also tax-advantaged (traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
     - Contribution limits (for 2023: $6,500, or $7,500 if age 50+).

   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - No tax advantages.
     - More flexible for withdrawals.
     - Capital gains taxes apply on profits when selling investments.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - Assess whether your focus is on long-term retirement saving or short-term financial goals.
   - Determine if you have specific target dates for using the funds.

### 3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts when possible:
     - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, especially if there’s an employer match.
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional investments.
  
### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - Ensure a mix of investments across all accounts to balance risk.
   - Different types of investments may have different tax implications when sold.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Keep in mind the rules around withdrawals for each type of account, especially for IRAs and 401(k)s which may impose penalties for early withdrawals.

### 6. **Rebalance and Adjust Over Time**
   - Periodically reassess how your investments are allocated across your accounts to ensure they align with your evolving goals and market conditions.

### Summary
1. **Max out contributions** to your 401(k) and IRA before considering a taxable account.
2. **Diversify your investments** across accounts for optimal risk management.
3. **Revisit your strategy** regularly based on changes in your circumstances or financial goals.
