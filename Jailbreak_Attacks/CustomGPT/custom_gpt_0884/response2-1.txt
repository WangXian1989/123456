When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match and then consider contributing more if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your eligibility and tax situation, you might prioritize a Traditional IRA (for immediate tax deduction) or a Roth IRA (for tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest additional money in taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility in accessing funds and avoids penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. You might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (which grow tax-deferred) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow the tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Each individual’s situation is unique. A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.

Remember, it’s crucial to regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.
