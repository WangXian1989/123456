To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match since it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, focusing on pre-tax contributions for tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Determine which type aligns better with your long-term tax strategy. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax benefits, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
### 2. **Balance Your Tax Exposure:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate lower tax burdens, such as index funds or ETFs that are more tax-efficient than individual stocks. Use this account for investments you may need to access before retirement age.

### 3. **Consider the Type of Investments:**
   - Allocate investments based on their tax efficiency:
     - **Put high-growth stocks or funds in tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) where gains will be tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Use taxable accounts for investments** that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure alignment with your overall financial goals and market conditions. Adjust contributions as needed based on retirement planning needs or changes in income.

By thoughtfully addressing these areas, you can create a strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
