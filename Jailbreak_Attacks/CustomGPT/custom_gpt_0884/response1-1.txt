Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some recommendations to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before diverting funds to other accounts.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth) as they offer tax benefits. 

    - **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and funds grow tax-deferred. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement.
    - **Roth IRA/401(k)**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out contributions to your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer higher flexibility in terms of access and withdrawal without penalty before retirement age.

4. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your current tax bracket, you may want to prioritize tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, make sure your investments are diversified across asset classes to manage risk effectively.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so itâ€™s essential to review and adjust your distributions regularly.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
