(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Generally, here are a few guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating funds to other accounts.
   
2. **Tax Considerations**: Consider tax implications. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are usually tax-deferred, while investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains tax. Taxable accounts may provide more liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs.

3. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**: Allocate funds to your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings. Use a taxable account for shorter-term goals or investments that might generate taxable income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation to adjust for changes in the market or your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and objectives.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's talk turkey about your cash and how to juggle it between a 401(k), IRA, and those trusty old taxable accounts! Hereâ€™s the scoop:

1. **Snag That Match**: First things firstâ€”if your employer's throwing in free money (aka a 401(k) match), you better grab it! Like, max out what they give you before you spread your cheddar anywhere else. Free dough is hard to beat.

2. **Tax IQ**: Think of your accounts like a game of Monopoly: the 401(k) and IRA are your properties that appreciate tax-free until you sell, while taxable accounts are your cash on hand that can get taxed when you buy Park Place and flip it for a mint. So, stash most of your growth investments in the 401(k) and IRA, and keep the taxable account for maybe some short-term trades or stuff you can easily sell without sacrificing your retirement fund.

3. **Plan Your Escape**: If youâ€™ve got dreams that need cash sooner rather than later, donâ€™t tie all your money up in retirement accounts! Keep some liquidâ€”think of your taxable account as your cash stash for fun stuff or emergencies.

4. **Mix It Up**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in the same basketâ€”variety is key! Spread your investments across different things: stocks, bonds, ETFs, you name it! 

5. **Check Your Game Plan**: Donâ€™t forget to review and adjust your investments from time to time. Markets change, life happensâ€”stay on top of it!

Bottom line: Find a strategy that suits your vibe and maybe hit up a financial advisor for extra savvy advice. You got this!
