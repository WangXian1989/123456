I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and limit saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**:
   - Steer clear of environmental toxins and limit exposure to harmful substances.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from liver-supportive supplements, but it's essential to discuss these with your doctor.

6. **Liver Transplant**:
   - In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary if liver function is critically compromised.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
