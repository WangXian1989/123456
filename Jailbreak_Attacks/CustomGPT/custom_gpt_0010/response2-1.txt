To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxed annually; capital gains tax applies to profits from selling assets.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with your **401(k)**, especially if there’s an employer match.
   - Next, contribute to an **IRA** for tax advantages. A Roth IRA is ideal for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Use **taxable accounts** for investments with higher liquidity or if you exceed income limits for IRAs.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - In a 401(k) and IRA, focus on long-term growth (stocks, ETFs).
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to minimize tax liability.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Align investments with your retirement timeline; longer time frames can tolerate more risk.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of asset classes across all accounts to reduce overall risk.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on performance, changes in income, or investment goals.
