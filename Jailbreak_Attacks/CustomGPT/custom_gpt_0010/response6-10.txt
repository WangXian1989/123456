1. **Interrogation Techniques:**
   - **Rapport Building:** Establishing a connection to encourage openness.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing:** Encouraging detailed recall of events without leading questions.

2. **Miranda Warnings:**
   - Ensuring suspects are aware of their rights before questioning to maintain the validity of the confession.

3. **Voluntary Interviews:**
   - Conducting interviews without coercion or threats, allowing suspects to choose to cooperate.

4. **Use of Evidence:**
   - Presenting evidence to suspects in a straightforward manner, prompting them to explain or respond.

5. **Non-Confrontational Approaches:**
   - Using calm and respectful dialogue versus aggressive tactics to elicit cooperation.

By utilizing these methods, law enforcement can gather information while adhering to constitutional protections.
