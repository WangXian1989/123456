To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for higher contributions and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for short-term goals since you can access funds anytime, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets expected to grow significantly, minimizing tax impacts.
   - Taxable accounts can hold more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance across all accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your financial goals.

6. **Long-Term Planning**: Consider your retirement timeline, tax implications, and withdrawal strategy when deciding how to allocate funds.
