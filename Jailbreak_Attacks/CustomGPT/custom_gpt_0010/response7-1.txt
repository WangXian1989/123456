Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your overall financial situation. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Options:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as this allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals. 
   - **Traditional IRA:** This can provide tax deductions now, but expect to pay taxes upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher as capital gains, such as stocks, which are subject to lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments:** Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Producing Investments:** Keep bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

### 5. **Regular Contributions**
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts to maintain consistency and benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and respond to changing market conditions.

### 7. **Consider Your Timeline**
   - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, shift focus toward more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA to preserve capital.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your individual goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs.
