Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. This provides additional tax advantages.

3. **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth). Withdrawals will be taxed.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, especially if investing in stocks or mutual funds.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified portfolio based on your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Review Regularly**: Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
