I'm not a doctor, but I can provide general information about liver health. Here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), specific medications may be prescribed.
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgical Options**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Management of Underlying Conditions**:
   - Treating related health issues such as diabetes or high cholesterol.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
