To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**:
   - Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
     - **IRS Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (or $7,500 if 50+).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs).
   - Hold bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to avoid immediate taxation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for your withdrawals based on tax implications; consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts as needed in retirement.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Tax Brackets**:
   - Factor in your current and expected future tax rates when deciding how much to allocate to each account type.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
