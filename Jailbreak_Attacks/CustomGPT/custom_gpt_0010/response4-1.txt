To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Asset Allocation Based on Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities in your 401(k) and IRA for potential higher returns.
   - **Near-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may need to be accessed sooner, favoring more stable options like bonds.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Consider holding income-generating assets like bonds or real estate in taxable accounts for favorable tax treatment.

4. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals; rebalance annually or semi-annually.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain liquidity in a savings account separate from these investments for unexpected expenses.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation, considering your income, expenses, and long-term goals.
