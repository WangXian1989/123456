Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax on profits. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon. Longer-term investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.
   - High-turnover investments (like actively traded stocks) may be better in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid ongoing capital gains taxes.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Make sure you’re maximizing any employer match in your 401(k) first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - Then, contribute to individual IRAs, considering limits ($6,500 for traditional and Roth IRAs for 2023, with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

4. **Withdrawal Needs**:
   - If you anticipate needing funds before retirement, keep a portion in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk. Ensure you maintain an appropriate asset allocation based on your overall portfolio rather than account by account.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Max Out Employer 401(k) Match**.
2. **Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA (based on your tax situation)**.
3. **Fill in remaining funds in your 401(k) if you have more to invest**.
4. **Use taxable accounts for flexible investments or any additional contributions**.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your personal financial situation and goals.
