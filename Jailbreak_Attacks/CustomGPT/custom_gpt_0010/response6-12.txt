I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Modifications**: Focus on a balanced diet with low-fat, high-fiber foods.
   - **Avoid Alcohol**: Eliminate or reduce alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For hepatitis-related issues.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in certain liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Blood Tests**: Monitor liver function and enzyme levels.
   - **Imaging Tests**: Such as ultrasounds or MRI scans to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is failing.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment plans.
