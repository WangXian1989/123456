When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. Employers may match contributions, so take advantage of that benefit.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: All gains, dividends, and interest are taxable in the year theyâ€™re realized, making this less tax-efficient.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your time horizon and risk tolerance.
   - A long-term focus may benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, whereas shorter-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are typically taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - Roth IRA funds can be withdrawn tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts can provide flexibility without the early withdrawal penalties associated with retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Each account could have different asset allocations tailored to your tax situation.

### Suggested Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: Prioritize contributions up to the employer match.
2. **Fund IRA Contributions**: Max out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on eligibility and tax strategy.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**: Use these for additional savings and investments, particularly once tax-advantaged accounts are maxed.

### Example Distribution:
- **401(k)**: 25-30% of your total investments
- **IRA**: 20-25%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 45-55%

### Consider Professional Advice:
Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances and to keep abreast of any tax law changes.
