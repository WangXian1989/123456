Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Consider maxing out if you can.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Tax Advantages**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing a Roth IRA may be advantageous.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals**: These accounts can be accessed without the penalties or taxes associated with retirement accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses saved in a liquid account before investing heavily.
- **Debt Management**: Pay off high-interest debts before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Avoid putting all your money in one type of account; consider a balanced portfolio across all accounts.
- **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

### **Review and Adjust**
- **Reassess Annually**: Evaluate your distribution strategy each year based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual circumstances vary significantly, so getting personalized advice can be helpful.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
