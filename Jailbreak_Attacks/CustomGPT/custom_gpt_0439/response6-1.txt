To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions within the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, consider a traditional IRA.

### 2. **Balance Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors can take more risks.
   - **Tax-Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and optimize equities in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and adjust for changing financial circumstances or market conditions.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider which accounts to draw from first for tax efficiency.

### Summary:
- **Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Balance risk and optimize for tax efficiency.**
- **Regularly review and adjust your portfolio.**

By following these guidelines, you can build a robust retirement portfolio that aligns with your financial goals.
