Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider this for higher income brackets.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you expect your tax rate to rise or fall.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility but subject to capital gains tax. Consider this for shorter-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain sufficient liquid assets in cash or a savings account separate from these investments for unexpected expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) within each account to manage risk.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust contributions based on your age and risk tolerance. Younger individuals might opt for more aggressive investments, while those closer to retirement generally shift toward conservative choices.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals, whether that’s retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to reflect changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
