Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer flexibility and access without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, stock-heavy investments can go in tax-advantaged accounts, while bonds or income-generating assets may be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in financial needs.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific situation.
