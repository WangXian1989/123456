To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future withdrawal plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for excess funds after maxing out retirement accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but may involve capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments (like bonds) to manage taxes on capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If retirement is far off, allocate more to growth-oriented investments. If it's approaching, lean towards stability and income.

6. **Diversify**: Ensure you maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
