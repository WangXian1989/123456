To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For traditional accounts, contributions reduce your taxable income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. This can provide balanced growth and reduce risk.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement age, such as cash or short-term investments.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax consequences of selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances.
