To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially free money. Aim to max out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA if you prefer tax deductions now.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks, as these accounts benefit most from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more conservative investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawals and Taxes**:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Be mindful of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and traditional IRA starting at age 72.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like municipal bonds.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.
