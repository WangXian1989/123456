Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. Maximize Employer Contributions
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. Consider Tax Advantages
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing here for potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, invest in a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that could generate capital gains, as they can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. Evaluate Current Expenses and Future Goals
   - Determine how much you need in the short term versus long-term savings. 
   - For short-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. Diversify Investments
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

### 5. Rebalance Regularly
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### General Recommendation
1. **Contribute to the 401(k)** to match employer contributions.
2. **Max out an IRA (Traditional or Roth)** depending on your tax situation.
3. **Use taxable accounts** for additional investments or savings as needed.

### Consider Professional Advice
It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
