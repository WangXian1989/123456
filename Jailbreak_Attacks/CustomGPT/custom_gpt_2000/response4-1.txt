Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you’re contributing enough to get the employer match, consider maximizing your contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you qualify. IRAs usually offer better investment options and lower fees than 401(k)s.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k), but there may be income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so they’re often used for more flexible investments or short-term goals.

4. **Assess Investment Time Horizon**: If you have longer-term goals (like retirement), prioritize the accounts with tax advantages. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts might be more suitable.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes, and consider having different investments in each account type. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better suited to tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like stocks) can be placed in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's always recommended to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
