(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both Traditional and Roth, if applicable) because these accounts offer tax benefits.

2. **Consider your tax situation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be the better choice due to its immediate tax deduction.

3. **Invest in taxable accounts last**: Once you've maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, you can begin adding to taxable accounts. Here, consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Rebalance regularly**: Whichever distribution you choose, periodically review and adjust your portfolio to make sure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down like a financial guru! Your money distribution between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be like a well-crafted pizzaâ€”each slice has its flavor and purpose. 

1. **401(k) Match**: First things first, snag that employer match on your 401(k)! It's free money, so donâ€™t leave it on the tableâ€”it's like finding $20 in your old jacket.

2. **IRA Power**: Next up, if you're going for that Roth IRA and your income allows it, get those sweet tax-free withdrawals in the future. If you think your taxes will rise, go for the traditional route. Either way, max out contributionsâ€”like stretching a rubber band, but donâ€™t snap it, okay?

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve milked the retirement accounts dry (in a good way), itâ€™s time to dip into taxable accounts. Just make sure to pick investments that are tax-efficient, or else Uncle Sam's gonna show up with a hefty bill.

4. **Regular Check-ups**: And donâ€™t forget to check your investments regularlyâ€”just like youâ€™d monitor your diet after the holidays. Rebalance and adjust as needed, 'cause the financial world is constantly throwing curveballs!
