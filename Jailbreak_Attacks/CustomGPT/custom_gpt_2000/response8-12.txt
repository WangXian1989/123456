I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition. Common approaches could include lifestyle changes, medications, dietary adjustments, or in some cases, more advanced treatments like liver transplantation. Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding your liver health.
