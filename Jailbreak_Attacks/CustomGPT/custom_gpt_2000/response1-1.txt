The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. For example, contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. This means investing in a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary. Market fluctuations can change the proportion of your investments, so make adjustments to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Understand Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of each account type. For example, capital gains from taxable accounts are subject to taxes when realized, while gains in tax-advantaged accounts are not taxed until withdrawal (for traditional accounts).

6. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from your retirement investments in case of unexpected expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, a balanced approach will help you grow your investments while minimizing taxes.
