The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment timeline, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine an optimal distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. This account can provide tax advantages that might benefit you depending on your current income and future expectations.

3. **Back to Your 401(k)**: If you're still below contribution limits, return to your 401(k) to maximize your contributions. The 401(k) typically has a higher contribution limit compared to an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but come with tax implications.

5. **Investment Allocation**: In each account, consider diversifying your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors may benefit from a higher allocation to equities, while those closer to retirement may want to reduce risk by investing in more stable assets.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax, while holding tax-inefficient investments that might generate more taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review Regularly**: Continuously review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change. 

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial planner to create a personalized strategy tailored to your individual circumstances.

Always make sure to stay informed about the specific rules and limits associated with each account type.
