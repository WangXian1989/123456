The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general considerations to guide your allocation:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Consider maxing out employer-matching contributions first.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits apply, especially with traditional IRAs. If you qualify, consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not provide tax benefits but offer flexibility with investments and withdrawals. Prioritize low-turnover, tax-efficient investments like index funds.

2. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess when you plan to retire and your expected retirement expenses. Balancing growth (e.g., in your 401(k) or IRA) with liquidity (in taxable accounts) matters based on your timeline.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use retirement accounts for higher-risk investments (equities), as they benefit from tax advantages.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-risk investments or those that produce interest or dividends, which may incur tax liabilities.

4. **Consider Contributions Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type and maximize contributions based on IRS guidelines.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you will draw from each account in retirement for tax optimization. Generally, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and objectives.
