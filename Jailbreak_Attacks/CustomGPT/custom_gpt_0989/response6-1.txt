Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Employer Match in 401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**:
     - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Needs**:
     - For short-term goals (within 5 years), prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
     - For long-term retirement, focus more on 401(k) and IRA contributions.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to balance risk and return.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Reassess your allocations annually as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

By adhering to this strategy, you can optimize your savings for retirement while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
