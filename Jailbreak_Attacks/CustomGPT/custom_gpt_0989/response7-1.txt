Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. After that, consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Best practices include holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates. Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover and that may generate tax-efficient income, like municipal bonds.

### 3. **Investment Strategies**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within and across all accounts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-yielding investments (like REITs or bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts. Keep lower-yield investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Your Age and Goals**
   - If youâ€™re younger and investing for the long term, you might lean more toward aggressive investments in your retirement accounts. As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your goals, market conditions, or tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: 20% of your income, especially if there's a match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (currently $6,500/year; $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Account**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA, invest in taxable accounts.
