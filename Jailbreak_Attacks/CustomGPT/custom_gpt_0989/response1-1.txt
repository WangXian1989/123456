Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contribution if possible.
   - **IRA**: After the 401(k), either a Traditional or Roth IRA might be next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now (but taxes later). 

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - The **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts typically offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow without immediate taxation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to minimize tax impact. They are also a good place for money you might need access to before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification and Investment Choices:**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio. While tax-advantaged accounts may offer limited investment choices (like mutual funds or target-date funds in a 401(k)), taxable accounts allow you to pick individual stocks or ETFs.
   - Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For instance, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, and hold bonds or dividend stocks in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### 4. **Emergency Fund First:**
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses). This can be kept in a high-yield savings account or similar.

### 5. **Rebalance as Necessary:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals as you approach retirement.

### Conclusion:
Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your retirement goals, current financial situation, and risk tolerance. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
