Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after or along with your 401(k). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate higher taxable returns. It's generally better to hold growth stocks or index funds in tax-advantaged accounts where capital gains are not taxed until withdrawals begin.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting in your taxable account to offset capital gains with losses.

3. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: 
   - Funds in 401(k) and IRAs are typically less accessible without penalties before retirement age. If you anticipate needing cash in the short term, consider allocating more to your taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across these accounts. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizons.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they still align with your goals and market conditions. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your projected tax bracket in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing Roth IRAs may make sense. If you expect a lower bracket, Traditional retirement accounts might be more beneficial now.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and future goals.
