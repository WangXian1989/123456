To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers further tax advantages depending on your income level and whether you choose pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) contributions.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits (e.g., for 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 for individuals under 50, and $30,000 for those 50 and older; IRA limits stand at $6,500 or $7,500 for those 50 and older).
   - Allocate your funds accordingly, ensuring you are not exceeding these limits.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable brokerage accounts can be advantageous for investments you might want to access before retirement, as they donâ€™t have early withdrawal penalties. However, dividends and capital gains taxes will apply.
   - For long-term investments, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts is beneficial.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Regardless of account type, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.
   - Ensure that your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and investment strategy. This could be annually or biannually.

6. **Financial Goals**:
   - Consider your short-term (buying a house, travel) vs. long-term (retirement) financial goals to determine how much to allocate to each account. This will guide your investment decisions.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If unsure, consult a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can strategically distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and tax efficiency over time.
