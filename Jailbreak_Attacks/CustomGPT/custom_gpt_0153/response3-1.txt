The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. The growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Depending on your tax bracket, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA**: You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be more advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money in taxable accounts does not have the same tax advantages but offers flexibility. You can use these funds without penalties before retirement age.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before investing heavily in retirement accounts. This typically covers 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. This could include stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Reviews and Adjustments**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market conditions, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Depending on your financial situation, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that aligns with your unique needs.

In summary, a balanced approach targeting employer matches, tax efficiency, and diversification across accounts can help optimize your investments for retirement.
