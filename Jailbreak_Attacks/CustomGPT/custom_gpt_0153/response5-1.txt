The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - Maximize your contributions up to the limit allowed ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older) if you can afford to do so and are not nearing retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA (with a limit of $6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - If you opt for a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider which option aligns best with your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you have funds left after maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account for more flexibility. This allows for a range of investment options and the ability to withdraw funds without penalties.
   - Be mindful of taxes on dividends, capital gains, and other investment income in taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. This means spreading investments over different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to mitigate risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize your overall tax burden.

6. **Periodic Review:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific goals and needs, ensuring you're making the best financial decisions for your future.
