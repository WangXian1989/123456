To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs work similarly to 401(k)s in terms of tax treatment. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Be mindful of holding periods for long-term vs. short-term capital gains.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k).
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits (e.g., for 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500; for IRAs, it's $6,500 for traditional and Roth IRAs, with additional catch-up contributions allowed for those 50 and older).

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRAs for long-term retirement savings, focusing on growth-oriented investments.
   - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Taxable accounts can be used for shorter-term goals or as a source of liquidity; consider more conservative investments here to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds. For example, if you're likely to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider drawing from taxable accounts first while allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Distribute your investments across different asset classes in each account type to manage risk and enhance returns over time.

### Example Strategy
1. **Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain the full employer match**.
2. **Max out your IRA contributions** (if eligible), with a preference for Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts**, focusing on long-term capital gain assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes.

It's often advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can consider your unique circumstances and help tailor a comprehensive investment strategy.
