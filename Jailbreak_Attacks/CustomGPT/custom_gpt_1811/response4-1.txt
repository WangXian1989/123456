To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or emergency funds? Your goals will impact your distribution strategy.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often comes with tax advantages. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and many employers offer matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Traditional IRAs can offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose the type that best fits your tax situation and retirement goals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but donâ€™t have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Capital gains taxes will apply, so consider this when investing in a taxable account.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Start with Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 ($7,500 if you are age 50 or older). Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, so max out contributions here if eligible.
   - **Fill up the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit ($22,500 in 2023; $30,000 if age 50 or older).

4. **Allocate Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically. Market fluctuations can skew your original investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, seeking advice from a financial expert can help you tailor your distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.

7. **Stay Informed on Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals, especially from taxable accounts. Retain awareness of capital gains tax rates.

By using these steps, you can create a well-rounded strategy to distribute your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Let me know if you have more specific questions or need further assistance!
