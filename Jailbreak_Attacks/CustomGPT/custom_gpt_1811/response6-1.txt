When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors such as your age, income, investment goals, and tax situation. Here are the steps to determine the best allocation:

1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Define your short-term vs. long-term financial goals.
   - Consider the time horizon for each goal (e.g., retirement age, purchasing a home).

2. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA:** Available to individuals, either traditional or Roth. Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. They offer flexibility and liquidity, but may result in higher tax liabilities.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits and Benefits:**
   - Make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching, as it is essentially "free money."
   - Understand the annual limits for contributions in IRAs and 401(k) plans to maximize benefits.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:**
   - Distribute investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments (e.g., stocks) may be placed in accounts with longer time horizons.
   - Balance between conservative (bonds, fixed income) and aggressive (stocks, mutual funds) investments.

5. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s to minimize tax impacts over time.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., tax-efficient index funds).

**Next Steps:**
- Calculate how much to contribute to each account type based on your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your financial landscape.
