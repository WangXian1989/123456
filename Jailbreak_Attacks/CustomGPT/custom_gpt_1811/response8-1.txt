Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions if you're in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement; contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRAs can help reduce your taxable income if you need immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short term, as they offer more flexibility with withdrawals.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies, such as index funds or tax-loss harvesting, to minimize taxable events.

### Suggested Steps:
- **Assess Your Needs**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals to decide how much liquidity you need.
- **Max Contributions**: If possible, max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Invest in Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Direct funds to tax-advantaged accounts before taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, maintain a diversified investment portfolio suited to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation periodically and adjust based on changes in income, life circumstances, or market conditions.

### Final Note:
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy based on your unique financial situation. They can provide guidance specific to your needs and help you optimize your investment approach.
