Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a retirement plan with a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional). If you’re eligible, a Roth IRA grows tax-free, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you choose a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income level.

3. **Continue to Fund 401(k)**: If you still have funds after maxing out your IRA contributions and you’re looking to save more for retirement, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Always keep an eye on your tax bracket and think about the tax implications of each investment. Balancing high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts with lower-growth, income-generating investments in taxable accounts can help minimize your tax burden.

6. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

Ultimately, it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique financial situation.
