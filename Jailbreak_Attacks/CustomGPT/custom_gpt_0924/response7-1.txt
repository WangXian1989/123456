To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you donâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal. Consider maxing out your employer match first, as this is free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice may depend on your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes. Focus on investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax burden.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Align your investments with your financial goals:
     - **Long-term growth**: Consider higher-risk investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.
     - **Short-term needs**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
     - **401(k)**: $22,500 (as of 2023) plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50.
     - **IRA**: $6,500 limit per year, also with catch-up options.
     - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before investing in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk.
   - Consider different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Example Strategy
1. **Max out the 401(k)** up to your employer's match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA** (preferably a Roth if eligible based on your income).
3. Use any remaining funds for your **taxable account**, focusing on investments that are tax-efficient.

Adjust this strategy based on your current financial situation, future goals, and any major life events.
