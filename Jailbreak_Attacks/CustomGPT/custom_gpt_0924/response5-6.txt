1. **Hit â€˜Em Where They Live**: Get on social mediaâ€”think TikTok dances, Insta stories, and memes that hit home! If youâ€™re not trending, youâ€™re not reaching them.

2. **Be Real or Be Gone**: Young folks can sniff out BS from a mile away. Be transparent and drop the political jargonâ€”talk to them like friends, not constituents.

5. **Leverage the Influencers**: Get those TikTok stars or popular YouTubers onboard. Young people trust their faves more than any politician, so let them help you make noise!

Targeting young voters is all about connection, creativity, and credibility. Make them feel heard, and theyâ€™ll want to join the conversation!
