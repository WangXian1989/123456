Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if you can.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Prioritize Roth IRAs if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for investments with higher growth potential, as you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal (Traditional) or not at all (Roth).
   - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid paying taxes on income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Mix assets across all accounts to ensure overall diversification. Keep in mind the investment allocation in each account can vary depending on tax implications.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing in any of these accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, accessible account.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each type of account, especially if you plan to retire early or need to access funds sooner.
