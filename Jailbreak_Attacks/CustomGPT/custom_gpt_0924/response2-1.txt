Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Offered by employers, often with matching contributions. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: IRAs provide tax advantages; Traditional IRAs allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs let you withdraw contributions tax-free if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on realized profits. More flexible, with no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.

### 2. **Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for more accessible funds without penalties.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money.
   - Then, maximize your IRA contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate surplus funds to a taxable account.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Interest-bearing assets (like bonds) may be more suitable for taxable accounts because they are taxed as ordinary income.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Review your allocations regularly and adjust based on market performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

### 6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - A financial advisor can tailor strategies based on your unique financial situation.

### Example Scenario:
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions to either type.
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds.

By aligning your distribution strategy with your financial goals and tax situation, you can optimize your investments effectively.
