Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the timeline for when you plan to access those funds. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribution**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions lower your taxable income. This is ideal if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Roth IRAs are great if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now but are taxed upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement. They offer more flexibility but less tax advantage.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Spread investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk assets may be better held in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments can be in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw money in retirement. Typically, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on performance, changes in income, or shifts in your financial goals.
