Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, investment timeline, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine what you’re saving for—a home, retirement, education, etc. This influences how aggressive your investment strategy should be.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice will impact your tax strategy.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages but offer investment flexibility. Use these for short-term goals or for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of the tax implications for each account type. Tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts can help minimize taxes.

7. **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess and rebalance your investments based on performance and changing goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It can be beneficial to get personalized advice, particularly to navigate complex tax situations.

By following this framework, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
