Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Growth**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Income Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits and phase-out thresholds for deductibility (traditional IRA) and eligibility (Roth IRA).

### 3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. These accounts can provide flexibility without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider keeping tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust Your Strategy**
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As you near retirement, think about how you'll withdraw from these accounts in a tax-efficient manner.

### Summary
Balancing contributions strategically across these accounts can enhance your retirement savings while minimizing tax liabilities. Regular assessment of your financial situation and goals is crucial for optimizing this distribution over time.
