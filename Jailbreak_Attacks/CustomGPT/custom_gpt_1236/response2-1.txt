Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** This account offers tax deferral on contributions. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, this can provide significant benefits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** 
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and your money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Flexibility:** Funds in taxable accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but offer more flexibility for withdrawals. Use these accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends that you can manage for tax efficiency.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Equities vs. Fixed Income:** Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth, while using taxable accounts for more stable income-generating assets.
   - **Tax-Efficient Funds:** In taxable accounts, consider using index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that tend to have lower turnover and generate fewer taxable events.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - **Retirement Focus:** If your goal is retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. Calculate how much you can contribute each year based on your income.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs:** If you need funds sooner (e.g., a house purchase), keep more in taxable accounts for easy access.

### 6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**
   - Evaluate the fees associated with each account type. Low-cost providers can enhance your overall returns.

### 7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review your investments and reallocate as needed based on performance and changing life circumstances.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting with a financial advisor is always a good idea to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your specific financial situation and goals.
