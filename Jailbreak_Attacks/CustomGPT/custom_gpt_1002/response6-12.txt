I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for medical advice tailored to your situation. Treatment options for liver problems can vary greatly depending on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Generally, here are some common strategies that healthcare providers may recommend:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugars, and salt can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help manage weight and reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, antivirals may be prescribed.
   - **Anti-inflammatory drugs**: To reduce inflammation in conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function through regular blood tests and imaging studies.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**: Alcohol can significantly worsen liver conditions, so abstaining is often advised.

Consulting with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and treatment options is important.
