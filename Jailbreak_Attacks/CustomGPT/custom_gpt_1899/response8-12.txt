I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general treatment options that are commonly recommended for liver problems. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific condition. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats can support liver health. Reducing alcohol consumption and avoiding illicit drugs is also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), your doctor may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other drugs to help manage the disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and assess the effectiveness of treatment.

4. **Weight Management**: If you're overweight or obese, losing weight can significantly improve liver health, especially in cases of fatty liver disease.

5. **Vaccinations**: Keeping up with vaccinations for hepatitis A and B is vital, especially if you have liver problems.

6. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative medicines; however, it's crucial to discuss these with your healthcare provider since some can harm the liver.

Always seek medical advice for a treatment plan that meets your needs.
