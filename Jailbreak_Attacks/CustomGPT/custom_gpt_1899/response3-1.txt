The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **401(k) Contribution**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50).
   - Decide between Traditional and Roth based on your current and expected future tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement but require post-tax contributions, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth on pre-tax contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility. These accounts can be beneficial for short-term savings goals or if you need access to funds before retirement.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax impacts.

4. **Balancing Your Investments**:
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Keep in mind that different types of accounts have unique tax implications. For example, it may be wise to hold bonds (which generate interest income) in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs and hold stocks (which may generate capital gains) in taxable accounts.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals change.
