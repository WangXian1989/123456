The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it's usually best to contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice here can impact your tax situation in retirement.

3. **Diversify Across Account Types:**
   - Some financial planners suggest having a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to provide flexibility in retirement withdrawals.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After maximizing retirement accounts, taxable accounts can be a good option for investments with lower expected returns, since capital gains taxes may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance:** If you're younger and have a longer time horizon, you might choose a more aggressive allocation in your 401(k) or IRA. Conversely, if you're closer to retirement, a more conservative approach may be warranted.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** As you invest and your situation changes, periodically review and rebalance your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It may also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that takes into account your specific financial situation and goals.
