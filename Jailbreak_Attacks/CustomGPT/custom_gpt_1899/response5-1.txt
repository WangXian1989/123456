When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, the best approach depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), take full advantage of it first. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income and tax situation, you might choose a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions, taxes owed at withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: If you have additional funds to invest after contributing to an IRA, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions, as it often provides higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can start to invest in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful if you have withdrawal needs before retirement age, as withdrawing from 401(k)s or IRAs can incur penalties.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of your tax bracket. If you're in a lower tax bracket now, contributing to a Roth IRA could be particularly advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement, a Traditional IRA might be preferable.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. You may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where taxes on dividends and capital gains are deferred.

Ultimately, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.
