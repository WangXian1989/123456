I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health and treatment options. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

(α) The treatment options for liver problems largely depend on the specific condition you are dealing with, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Generally, treatment may include:

1. **Lifestyle changes**: This often involves adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral medications for hepatitis).
3. **Monitoring and management**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and institute appropriate management strategies.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases or for liver cancer, surgical options or procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always discuss with your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
