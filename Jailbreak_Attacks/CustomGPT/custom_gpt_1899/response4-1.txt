Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to start.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax), your tax situation can vary significantly. Traditional IRAs may reduce taxable income today, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t offer tax advantages but provide flexibility. Earnings are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
   - Once you've contributed to your retirement accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts.

4. **Look at Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re saving for long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Periodically review your distribution based on performance and changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement plans.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Since individual circumstances vary, getting personalized advice can greatly enhance your strategy.

This approach balances tax efficiency with growth potential while ensuring you have access to your funds when you need them.
