Œ± Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here‚Äôs a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus more on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and Traditional IRA. These accounts can lower your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred.

3. **Consider Roth Accounts**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or opting for a Roth 401(k). Contributions to these accounts grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are also tax-free in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can provide you with more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and access without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, think about your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. This could involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your investment strategy and account balances to adjust your contributions and allocations as necessary to align with any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.
