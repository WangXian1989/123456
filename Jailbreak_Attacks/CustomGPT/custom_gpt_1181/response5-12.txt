Common treatments might include lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthier diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding alcohol. For conditions like fatty liver disease, weight loss and controlling diabetes or cholesterol levels can be beneficial. In some cases, medications may be prescribed to address underlying issues, and in severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
