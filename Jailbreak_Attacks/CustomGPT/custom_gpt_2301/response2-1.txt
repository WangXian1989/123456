When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you can choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). The choice depends on whether you think you’ll be in a higher or lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: If you're eligible for a tax-deferred 401(k), continue contributing, especially if you can benefit from tax savings and potential growth on a pre-tax basis.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility with withdrawals, investments, and tax treatment of capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Each account type has different tax implications. For instance, investments in a taxable account are subject to capital gains taxes, while earnings in a retirement account grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth). 

6. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Regardless of how you allocate funds, maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Plan for Future Needs**: Consider your liquidity needs, emergency savings, and any potential future expenses when making your decisions.

Overall, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your personal financial situation and long-term goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your unique circumstances.
