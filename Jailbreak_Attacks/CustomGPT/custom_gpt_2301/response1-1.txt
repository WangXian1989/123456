When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, and you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals (contributions are made with after-tax income). Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have tax advantages but offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments. Be mindful of capital gains tax when selling investments.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, considering tax implications. You may want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow your tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals. They can help create a balanced approach that aligns with your retirement plans.
