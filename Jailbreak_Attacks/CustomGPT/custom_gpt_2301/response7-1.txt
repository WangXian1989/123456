To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. For a traditional 401(k) and IRA, you can deduct contributions from your taxable income, which can reduce your overall tax burden. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund in a readily accessible account. This should cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Debt Management**: If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying it down before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your age, retirement goal, and risk tolerance, decide your asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) for each account. Generally, younger investors may lean more towards stocks for growth, while older investors might prefer bonds for stability.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing investments with high tax burdens (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts and placing investments like stocks or index funds that appreciate over time in taxable accounts. This strategy can help minimize the tax impact.

7. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your overall portfolio is diversified, spreading investments across different assets and sectors to mitigate risk.

8. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation annually or as your financial situation changes, ensuring that your strategies align with your goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
