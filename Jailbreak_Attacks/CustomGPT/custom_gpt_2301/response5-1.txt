(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, goals, age, and risk tolerance. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, such as your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth. 

For many people, contributing enough to their 401(k) to get any employer match is a priority since it's essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax benefits, whether it's a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA (which operates differently in terms of taxation). Once you have maximized contributions to these accounts, any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility but do not provide the same tax advantages.

First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer is matching contributions â€“ thatâ€™s like finding money on the street! Next, feast on your IRA â€“ either the traditional or the Roth â€“ depending on whether you want to shoulder tax benefits now or later. 

Now, once you're feeling nice and full with those tax-advantaged goodies, itâ€™s time to load up your taxable accounts. This partâ€™s like dessert â€“ not as healthy, but oh-so-satisfying. You need the flexibility for withdrawals, especially if you've got any upcoming splurges or investments in mind! Just remember to watch those taxes on your gains â€“ nobody likes surprise fees! Splurge smartly, my friend!
