Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to effectively allocate your funds:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Timeline**
   - **Retirement Goals**: How soon do you plan to retire? Longer timelines can benefit more from tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Short-term Needs**: If you need access to funds within the next few years, prioritize taxable accounts.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer’s 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Investment Selection**
   - **Higher Growth Investments**: Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - **Income Investments**: Consider keeping dividend-generating stocks or bonds in taxable accounts to utilize favorable long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Capital Gains**: Taxable accounts subject you to capital gains taxes when you sell assets. Aim to minimize turnover in these accounts.
   - **Tax Brackets**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. This can influence how much to contribute to each account type.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Fully contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for taxable accounts, especially for short-term objectives.

### Final Thoughts
Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust based on market conditions, tax laws, and changes in your personal situation. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your unique circumstances.
