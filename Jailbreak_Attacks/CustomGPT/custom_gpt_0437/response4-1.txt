Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, tax considerations, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high-income tax rate now, prioritizing your 401(k) can reduce your taxable income. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if possible.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. This means not just spreading money out across accounts but also having a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Plan your withdrawals or contributions based on your current and projected future tax brackets. This can influence whether you should prioritize pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA, taxable) accounts.

6. **Adjust for Retirement Goals**: Evaluate your retirement goals and expected expenses to adjust how you allocate funds. If you plan to retire early, prioritize accounts with more accessible funds.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
