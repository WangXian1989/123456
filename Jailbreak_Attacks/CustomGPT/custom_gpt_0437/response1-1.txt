Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, particularly if youâ€™re eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Invest in a broader range of options available in IRAs, such as individual stocks or mutual funds not available in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Use these accounts for funds you might need accessible in the short term.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in less tax-inefficient assets (like ETFs or long-term investments) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a cash reserve before focusing heavily on investments.
- **Aggressive Saving**: Particularly at younger ages, consider higher contributions to the 401(k) and IRA, balancing with taxable accounts as needed.
- **Continual Review**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### Consider Professional Help:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored strategies based on your specific situation, needs, and risk profile.
