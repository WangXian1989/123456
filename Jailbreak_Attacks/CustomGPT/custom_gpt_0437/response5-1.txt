When planning the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold and dividends are taxed as income. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically to minimize taxes. For instance, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Consider Your Goals**: Align your investments with your short-term and long-term financial goals. This may include retirement, buying a home, or funding education.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on performance, changes in tax laws, and shifts in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals.
