Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your current income and tax bracket. For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

2. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Useful for high-income earners.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for savings goals that are short-term (less than 5 years), as investments held here are subject to capital gains taxes. Suitable for flexibility and liquidity.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts.
   - Consider risk tolerance and time horizon when choosing investments.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals.
