Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Placement Strategy**:
   - Place investments with the highest expected returns (that are also likely to incur the most taxes) in tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA).
   - Consider putting more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments can benefit from tax-deferred growth. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more suitable due to their liquidity.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on market performance and changes in your personal circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

Balancing these accounts effectively can help you optimize your tax situation and grow your wealth over time.
