Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income and tax bracket, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like dividends or interest). This can be a good place for stocks with high growth potential for long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - If you have long-term goals (e.g., retirement), focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, a taxable account may offer more flexibility.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

### 6. **Review and Adjust Periodically**
   - Reassess your strategy annually or after major life changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to your investments that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
