Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Current and Future Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends. This keeps your tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, adjusting for risk tolerance and age.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Ensure you have access to cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs while long-term growth is handled by retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 30%-50% of your investment budget.
- **IRA**: 20%-30%.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%-50%.

### Review Regularly
- **Annual Reassessment**: Adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Conclusion
This balanced approach helps maximize your returns while considering taxes and flexibility. Always consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your circumstances.
