Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This can be a significant advantage.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now. If you anticipate a higher bracket, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: These accounts offer flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax. They can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Types**: Consider low-turnover investments to minimize taxable events.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Depending on your situation, a personalized strategy may be beneficial.

Ultimately, a well-rounded approach often involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first before filling taxable accounts. Consider your immediate needs and long-term goals when allocating funds.
