To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can afford it, maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Investment Goals**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA primarily for long-term growth. Choose a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, or index funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals, as they allow for more flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping investments with lower tax rates (like qualified dividends or capital gains) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance as Needed**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your investments to align with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized advice, consider working with a financial advisor to develop a strategy tailored to your unique financial situation.

By prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts and aligning investments with your goals, you can optimize your overall returns while minimizing tax liabilities.
