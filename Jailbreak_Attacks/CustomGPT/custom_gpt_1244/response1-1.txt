The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA because they offer tax benefits. Traditional accounts provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth accounts offer tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider maxing out a Roth IRA, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. For a lower bracket, a traditional IRA or 401(k) might be more beneficial now.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for money you might need sooner since they offer more flexibility without the penalties of retirement accounts. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.
