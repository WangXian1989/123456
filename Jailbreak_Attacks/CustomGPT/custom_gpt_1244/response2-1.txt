To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Target Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on contributing to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and income limits). If eligible, consider later converting to Roth for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments after maxing out your tax-advantaged options. This allows for more liquidity and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance. Typically, you might want equities (stocks) in the taxable account for flexibility and tax implications and bonds or stable investments in tax-deferred accounts for growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolios across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced strategy that optimizes your tax advantages and addresses your financial goals.
