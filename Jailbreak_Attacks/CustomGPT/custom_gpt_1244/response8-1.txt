Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Max Out Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider which type of IRA offers the most tax advantages based on your income and tax bracket. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs to invest in a diversified portfolio, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Keep a portion of your investments here for short-term needs or emergencies, as these funds can be accessed without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains tax exposure.

### Suggested Approach:
- **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before heavily investing.
- **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first.
- **Balanced Allocation**: A common strategy is to allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, gradually shifting toward more conservative investments as you approach retirement.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
