Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your overall financial strategy. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (or tax-deferred in the case of a Roth 401(k)), which may lower your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Tax Flexibility**: With a traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits, which are lower than those for 401(k)s.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts provide more flexibility for accessing funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Earnings and dividends are subject to capital gains tax, so consider the timing of buying/selling investments.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize funding your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and life circumstances.
