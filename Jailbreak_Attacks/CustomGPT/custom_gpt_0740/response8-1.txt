Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Max out any employer match first. Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you're eligible, consider maxing out an IRA. For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, direct any additional savings to a taxable investment account. This offers flexibility since you can access funds without penalties, though you'll pay capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk; typically, the longer your investment horizon, the more risk you can take on.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a diverse asset allocation within each account, balancing between stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider how you plan to withdraw funds during retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts may have penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Consultation:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
