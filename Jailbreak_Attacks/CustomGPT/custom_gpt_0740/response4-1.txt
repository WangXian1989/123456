To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can offer tax deductions (401(k) contributions) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA), depending on the type of account.

2. **Max Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amounts to these accounts, especially if your employer offers a match on your 401(k). Not taking full advantage of this is essentially leaving free money on the table.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement goals. Typically, higher-risk investments are better placed in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Consider potential withdrawal strategies when you retire. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, utilizing Roth accounts first could be beneficial.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money that you might need in the short term or for investments that benefit from favorable capital gains rates. This includes holding investments for over a year for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Given the complexities of tax implications and investment strategies, discussing your specific situation with a financial advisor can provide tailored insights.

By carefully strategizing your contributions and understanding the tax implications of each account type, you can maximize your investment potential over time.
