Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match, especially if it’s a Roth IRA, which can provide tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are better for funds you may need before retirement since you won’t face penalties for early withdrawals. However, you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, but withdrawals will be taxed as income.

3. **Assess Investment Options**:
   - 401(k) plans may have limited investment choices compared to IRAs or taxable accounts. If your 401(k) offers high fees or poor investment options, consider investing more in your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Make sure you have an emergency fund set aside in a liquid form before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

Considering these suggestions, what specific financial goals or retirement timelines do you have in mind? This could help refine the distribution strategy for your accounts.
