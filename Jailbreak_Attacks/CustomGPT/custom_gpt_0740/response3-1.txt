To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains and income you earn here are taxed in the year they are realized, which can lead to higher tax bills compared to retirement accounts.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Lastly, focus on your taxable accounts. Use these for investments that may be more tax-efficient, such as qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider the types of assets in each account based on tax implications. For instance, hold bonds (which generate regular income) in tax-advantaged accounts, and stocks (which may appreciate over time) in taxable accounts if possible, to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations and contributions at least annually. As your financial situation and market conditions change, reallocate funds as necessary.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.), but remember that individual accounts may have different needs based on your investment goals and tax strategies.

These steps can help you create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.

**Question**: What are your current contributions and financial goals, and how can they influence your distribution strategy across these accounts?
