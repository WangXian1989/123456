I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for specific advice. Generally, treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: This might involve a healthy diet, exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping track of liver function tests to monitor progress.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, a procedure may be necessary, such as a liver transplant.

Always seek personalized advice from your doctor for the best course of action.
