Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: 
     - A traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions but taxes withdrawals in retirement.
     - A Roth IRA uses after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties, making them ideal for short-term goals.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings in a liquid form (not in retirement accounts).
2. **401(k)**: Aim to maximize employer contributions first.
3. **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k), especially if you can contribute to a Roth IRA.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or to meet short- to medium-term goals after your retirement accounts are funded.

### Regularly Review:
- **Reassess Your Situation**: Periodically review your investments and adjust the distribution based on changes in income, goals, and market conditions.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your personal financial situation.

This balanced approach will help optimize growth while managing tax implications over time.
