I'm not a doctor, but I recommend discussing your liver issue with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment options tailored to your specific condition. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures, depending on the severity and type of liver problem. Always consult with a medical expert for personalized advice.
