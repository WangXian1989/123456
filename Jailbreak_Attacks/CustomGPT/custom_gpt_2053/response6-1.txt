To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your tax situation.

2. **Allocate Based on Investments:**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) or IRA.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments that benefit from tax deferral.

3. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Stay Informed on Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of withdrawal rules and tax implications for each account type, especially as you approach retirement.

These steps help ensure efficient growth while minimizing your tax burden over time. Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
