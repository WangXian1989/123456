I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional to discuss liver problems. Common treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition but may include:

1. **Medications:** Depending on the issue, medications can help manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.
2. **Lifestyle Changes:** A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
3. **Monitoring:** Regular check-ups and tests can help track liver function.
4. **Interventional Procedures:** In some cases, procedures like endoscopy or surgery may be required, especially for obstructions or tumors.
5. **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases of liver disease, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
