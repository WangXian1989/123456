Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should align with your financial goals, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, maximize your contributions to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This is especially beneficial if your employer offers a match.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable investment account. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals, offering flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the types of investments in each account based on their tax treatment:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Prioritize bonds or high-yield investments, which generate income and will be taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Focus on growth investments, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when to withdraw funds, considering tax implications and your retirement income needs.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
