Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for current tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This is beneficial for flexibility and potential lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across accounts. Stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and a mix based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Fees and Taxes**: Be mindful of expense ratios and tax implications. Holding high-yielding investments in tax-advantaged accounts can minimize tax bills.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Financial situations change. Review and adjust your allocation annually or when significant life changes occur.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice aligned with your specific circumstances.
