When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs for retirement savings. These accounts can offer tax deductions or tax-free growth.

2. **Account Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Investment Goals**: Assess your short-term and long-term financial goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Consider how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Funds in tax-deferred accounts will be taxed as ordinary income.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. High-growth assets may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns.

6. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your investments to ensure they align with your strategy, adjusting as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

By considering the above factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively across these accounts.
