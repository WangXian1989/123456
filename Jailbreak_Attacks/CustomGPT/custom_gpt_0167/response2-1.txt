I'm glad you're thinking about distributing your investments wisely! Here's a general approach to consider when allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Debt Management**: 
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider prioritizing paying that off before heavily investing.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account before investing heavily.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth and consider allocating funds in a diverse array of investments (stocks, bonds) according to your risk tolerance.

5. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short- to medium-term goals. Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-managed funds to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your allocations at least annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Fees**: 
   - Be mindful of fees, particularly in your 401(k) plan. Opt for low-cost index funds where possible.

These steps can help you create a balanced and effective investment strategy! Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
