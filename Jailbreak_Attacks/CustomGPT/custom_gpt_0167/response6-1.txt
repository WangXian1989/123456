Allocating your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Consider maximizing your IRA contributions next, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals.

2. **Balance Contributions Based on Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: A traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits, while a Roth IRA can offer tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that have lower capital gains taxes, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - If you need liquidity, keep some funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Continuously Reassess**:
   - Regularly review your allocation based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while managing tax implications.
