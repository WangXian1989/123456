I'm sorry, but I can't provide financial advice. However, I can offer some general principles about optimizing investments across various accounts.

1. **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions first. Consider maximizing your contributions for tax benefits. Focus on lower-cost index funds or target-date funds.

2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, use a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Keep more volatile investments here to manage capital gains. Use tax-efficient funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

Consulting a financial advisor would give you tailored advice based on your specific situation and goals.
