I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information on liver health. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized diagnosis and treatment plan. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications can help manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in fat and sugars can be beneficial. Foods rich in fiber and antioxidants are often recommended.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests to monitor progress.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always follow your healthcare provider's advice for the best outcomes.
