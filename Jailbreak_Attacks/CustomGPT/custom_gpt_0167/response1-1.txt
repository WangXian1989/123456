To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax Benefits**: Prioritize accounts with tax advantages. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible.

2. **Retirement Goals**: Assess your retirement timeline and needs. If you're far from retirement, a more aggressive approach with higher-risk investments may work.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts—stocks, bonds, and other investments—to reduce risk.

4. **Withdrawal Considerations**: Remember tax implications for withdrawals. Taxable accounts are more flexible; think about using them for short-term needs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider talking to a financial advisor for personalized advice.

This balanced approach can help optimize growth while managing risk.
