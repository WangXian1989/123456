I'm not able to provide financial advice, but I can help you understand some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Prioritize this if your employer offers matching contributions.

2. **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth. Consider whether a traditional IRA or Roth IRA is more beneficial for your current tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Good for flexibility and liquidity. Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax implications.

### General Strategy:
- Max out employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute to an IRA to benefit from tax advantages.
- Allocate remaining funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

Consider your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment horizons when making decisions. Consulting a financial advisor could provide tailored advice.
