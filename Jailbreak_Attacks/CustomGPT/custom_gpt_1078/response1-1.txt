The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts can help you reduce your taxable income and grow your investments tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for these accounts. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

4. **Invest Tax-Efficiently**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains and qualified dividends. This can minimize your tax burden since long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your distribution strategy, consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's essential to tailor your strategy to fit your goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.
