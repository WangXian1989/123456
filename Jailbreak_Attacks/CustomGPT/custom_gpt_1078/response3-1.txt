Distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider the IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, as contributions grow tax-free.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits set for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Allocate your funds to maximize these limits if possible.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional account may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing Roth accounts might be advantageous.

4. **Investment Choices**: Each account type offers different investment options. Your 401(k) may have limited investment choices compared to an IRA. Consider where you can invest in assets that align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA accounts have restrictions and possible penalties for early withdrawals. Consider keeping a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity needs.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Diversification is crucial regardless of account type. Ensure your portfolio is balanced across different asset classes to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust them according to changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your unique situation.
