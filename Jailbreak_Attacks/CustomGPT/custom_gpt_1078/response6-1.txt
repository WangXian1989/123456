When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to evaluate several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and your retirement timeline. Here’s a pragmatic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

2. **Assess Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free in retirement. Consider your current versus expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalty.

3. **Diversification of Assets**:
   - Balance your investments across all accounts. For instance, consider holding more aggressive investments in your tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth, while using your taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep a portion in your taxable account if you anticipate needing funds before retirement, as 401(k) and IRAs typically have withdrawal penalties before age 59½.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on market conditions and changes in tax laws or personal circumstances. 

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency over the long term. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your individual needs and goals.
