When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate your financial goals, tax situation, and the benefits of each account type. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts such as:
   - **401(k):** Contribute as much as you can up to the IRS limits, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA:** Depending on eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, particularly if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you may consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. These accounts offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties and can be a good option for short-term goals or if you may need liquidity.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation:** Regardless of account type, ensure that your investments are diversified to manage risk. Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when deciding how to allocate your assets among stocks, bonds, and other investments.

5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so it's important to regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocations as needed.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Depending on your specific circumstances, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Remember that each individual's financial situation is unique, so it's important to consider your personal goals and circumstances when making decisions about your investments.
