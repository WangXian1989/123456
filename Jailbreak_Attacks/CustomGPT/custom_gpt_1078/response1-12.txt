I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, it's crucial to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition you have. Common approaches could include medication, lifestyle changes (such as a healthier diet and avoiding alcohol), or more advanced therapies in serious cases. It's best to consult with a specialist who can provide personalized recommendations based on your health needs.
