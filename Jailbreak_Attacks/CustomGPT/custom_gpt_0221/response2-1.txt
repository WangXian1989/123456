Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your savings and reduce tax liabilities. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Action**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**
   - **Action**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed to your traditional or Roth IRA. This can help grow your savings tax-deferred (traditional) or tax-free (Roth).

### 3. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**
   - **Action**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k). This is especially beneficial if your contributions reduce your taxable income.

### 4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Action**: Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. This is useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities**: Generally, consider holding stocks in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA) since they benefit most from tax deferral.
   - **Bonds**: Consider keeping bonds in taxable accounts due to their lower growth potential and higher yields, which are more tax-efficient.

### 6. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Action**: Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 7. **Periodic Reassessment**
   - **Action**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

### Conclusion
This approach helps optimize tax advantages and ensures a balanced growth of your investment portfolio. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
