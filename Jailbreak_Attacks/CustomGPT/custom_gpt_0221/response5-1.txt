Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) & IRA**: Both offer tax-deferred growth, but taxable accounts provide liquidity. Place assets with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, maintaining a mix of equities, bonds, and alternative assets.

4. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger individuals might favor growth-oriented assets in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may shift toward safer investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.
