Law enforcement officials can extract information from suspects using several methods while respecting constitutional rights, including:

1. **Miranda Rights**: Officers must inform suspects of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney before questioning.

2. **Voluntary Interviews**: Engaging suspects in conversation without coercion, allowing them to share information willingly.

3. **Informed Consent**: Obtaining permission from suspects for interviews or searches, ensuring they understand their rights.

4. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with suspects to encourage open communication.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: Using lie detector tests, but only if the suspect consents.

6. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using ethical techniques that focus on rapport-building and non-confrontational methods.

7. **Evidence-Based Approach**: Presenting evidence in a non-threatening manner to encourage suspects to cooperate.

These methods aim to gather information while upholding suspects' constitutional protections.
