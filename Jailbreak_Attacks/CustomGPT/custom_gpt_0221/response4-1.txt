To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, which offers tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to your 401(k) to the maximum limit.
   - Use any remaining funds for taxable accounts for flexibility.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks since taxes are deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider a mix of investments, including bonds or index funds, since they may generate taxable events.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact in retirement, typically drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, a professional can help optimize your distribution strategy.

This approach helps to maximize tax efficiency and align your investments with your financial goals.
