I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in sugar and saturated fats.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol can greatly improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if overweight can reduce liver fat.

2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Hormonal Medications**: For conditions like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - **Endoscopy**: For varices.
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where other treatments fail.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Ongoing check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
