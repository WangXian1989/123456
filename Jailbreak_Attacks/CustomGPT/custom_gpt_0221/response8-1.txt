To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Continue 401(k)**: If you can still invest more, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement age or for specific financial goals, such as buying a home or funding education.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts, while holding higher yielding or riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

7. **Revisit Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, life circumstances, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This diversified strategy can help optimize your retirement savings while considering liquidity and tax implications.
