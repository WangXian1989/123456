Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Contribute to your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great return on investment.

2. **Max out your IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Consider keeping investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Consider holding more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a financial advisor**: For tailored advice, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.

Always consider your individual circumstances before making decisions.
