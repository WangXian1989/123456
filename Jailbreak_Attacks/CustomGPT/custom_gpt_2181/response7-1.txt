The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits:** The 401(k) has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. Maxing this out can be beneficial if you have the means.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase in the future.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Money in taxable accounts can be withdrawn at any time without penalties. This is useful for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### General Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with the 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Max out the IRA:** Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, choosing between Traditional and Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Contribute to the Taxable Account:** Finally, contribute to your taxable accounts, especially if youâ€™re saving for short-term needs or diversifying your portfolio.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Diversification:** Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specifically for your circumstances.
