To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth offers tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**:
   - Before investing heavily, pay down any high-interest debt to optimize your financial health.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Use each account type strategically. Consider holding bonds and less tax-efficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts and placing tax-efficient investments, like index funds, in taxable accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Align investment choices with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Stocks for long-term growth, bonds for stability, and cash for liquidity.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts can incur capital gains tax, while tax-advantaged accounts allow for tax deferral or tax-free growth.

6. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Automate contributions to help build your investment consistently over time, maintaining discipline in your savings.

7. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance, market conditions, and your changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking advice from a financial professional for personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.

This strategy should help you optimize growth while minimizing taxes and maintaining flexibility.
