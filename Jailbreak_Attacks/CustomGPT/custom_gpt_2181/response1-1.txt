Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit if you have a high-income tax rate. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for the tax deduction or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a readily accessible account, typically equal to 3-6 months of living expenses.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. They provide flexibility for withdrawals but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and return according to your age and risk tolerance.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can also be beneficial.
