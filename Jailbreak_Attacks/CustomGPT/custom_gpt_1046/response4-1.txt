To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following key points:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for assets that generate high taxable income, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks.
   - Place growth-oriented investments, like stocks, in taxable accounts since they have the potential for lower long-term capital gains tax when held for more than a year.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as applicable. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you're over 50) to take full advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure you at least contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to your IRA or taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This ensures a balanced risk profile and can help mitigate the effects of market volatility.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Consider your future withdrawal strategy when determining how to distribute your investments. Taxable accounts may be more accessible without penalties, while 401(k) and IRA funds are typically locked until retirement age.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation. Adjust contributions as needed based on performance and market conditions.

Overall, the ideal distribution will depend on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your circumstances can also be beneficial.
