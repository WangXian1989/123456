To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a structured approach to help you:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan that often comes with a match. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either Traditional (tax-deferred contributions) or Roth (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments made with after-tax dollars where you pay capital gains taxes on profits and dividends.

2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if eligible. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts. This will help grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred, depending on the account type.

4. **Tax Implications**:
   - Evaluate your tax situation: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, a Traditional IRA may be better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts while considering asset location (e.g., placing bonds in tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in taxable accounts). This ensures tax inefficiencies are minimized.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Keep an eye on your investment allocation and rebalance as necessary based on your risk tolerance and market performance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It might be wise to seek assistance from a financial planner to customize your strategy based on your unique goals and circumstances.

Remember, your distribution strategy may evolve as your financial situation changes, so it’s wise to review your allocations regularly.
