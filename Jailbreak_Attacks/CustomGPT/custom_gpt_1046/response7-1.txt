Î± The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. A general approach includes:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After obtaining the match, prioritize maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy) for its tax advantages.
  
3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, consider contributing more to your 401(k), especially if it has good investment options and low fees.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Make sure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts for unforeseen expenses.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable investment accounts for liquidity and flexibility.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

Overall, the right distribution strategy will vary by individual circumstances, and it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
