(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors such as your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it’s essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA first. Contributions to these accounts lower your taxable income and grow tax-deferred.
3. **Fill the IRA**: Once you've maximized any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate a lot of taxable interest, dividends, or short-term capital gains, as these can be taxed at higher rates.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer's throwing in a match, that's like free money! Max it out first—don’t leave that cash on the table!
2. **IRA Next**: Once you're milking that match, dive into your IRA. Depending on if you want tax advantages now or later, pick between a traditional (tax deduction now) or Roth (tax-free when you retire).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once the other two are chugging along, toss some funds into your taxable accounts. Great for wiggle room and easy access, but get ready to deal with those sweet, sweet capital gains taxes!

Basically, prioritize tax-saving avenues first, while keeping that taxable account as your flex fund. Just don’t forget to adjust your strategy based on life changes and consult a pro if you want the secret sauce tailored to you. Cheers to stacking that dough! 🍹💰
