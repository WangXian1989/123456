To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**: 
   - **401(k)**: Typically employer-sponsored with potential employer matching contributions. Earnings grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalty before retirement age.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - Maximize employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - Contribute to your IRA up to the contribution limit (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, divert additional funds to taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Prioritize accounts with tax advantages for growth (401(k) and IRA) to compound tax-free.
   - Keep investments that generate frequent taxable income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts if possible.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Adjust your overall portfolio to reflect your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Typically, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential.

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure that it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your personal financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a strategic distribution of your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to maximize your wealth accumulation and tax efficiency over time.
