To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you need to consider several factors including tax implications, your investment goals, and your time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, max out your contributions to gain tax benefits and growth potential.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA next. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate surplus funds to a taxable account. This can offer more flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.
   - Focus on stocks or investments that have favorable long-term capital gains treatment in taxable accounts, and consider tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Rebalance and Adjust**:
   - **Regular Reviews**: Periodically assess your investment allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.
   - **Tax Management**: Be mindful of tax implications, especially in taxable accounts, and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

By prioritizing your contributions based on tax advantages and flexibility, you can optimize your financial growth over time while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
