(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is free money. Then, consider contributing the maximum allowed if you can.

2. **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can provide tax advantages now, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax bracket and expected retirement tax rate when deciding between a traditional and Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money that you may need before retirement or for investments that may produce taxable events. This account offers more flexibility but lacks the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

Ultimately, balancing contributions based on your goals, the tax implications, and your financial situation is key. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies.
