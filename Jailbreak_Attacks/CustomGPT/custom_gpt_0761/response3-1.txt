Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. Are you saving for retirement, a home purchase, or another investment?

2. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this match, as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing up to the limit if it offers good investment options and low fees.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts to invest any additional funds after maximizing contributions to retirement accounts. This is especially useful for funds you may need before retirement age, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments within each account. Typically, aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider keeping more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Regular Contributions**: Set a consistent contribution schedule to each account, adjusting as necessary based on changes in income or financial goals.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your account allocations and make adjustments based on market performance and your evolving financial situation.

By carefully considering these factors and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can distribute your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
