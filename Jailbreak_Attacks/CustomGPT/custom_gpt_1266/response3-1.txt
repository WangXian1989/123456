Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Pay off any high-interest debt before investing heavily.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Once you’re contributing enough for the match, consider maxing out your contributions (as of 2023, the limit is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA (the limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose based on your tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These can provide more flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors may lean more towards stocks.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your investment allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Review Goals Annually**: Adjust your contributions and investment strategies based on changes in your financial situation and goals.

This approach allows you to take advantage of tax benefits and build a well-rounded investment portfolio. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
