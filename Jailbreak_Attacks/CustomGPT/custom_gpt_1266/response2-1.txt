Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money). If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), consider your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, you might benefit from contributing to a Roth account to lock in your tax rate. If you expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, traditional accounts might be better.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep your investments diversified across all accounts. Allocate based on your risk tolerance. Growth-oriented investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets here (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes and consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts due to their taxable interest.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals: possibly start with taxable accounts to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation yearly to ensure you stay aligned with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals can be invaluable.

Balancing contributions and investment choices wisely across these accounts can enhance tax efficiency and growth potential.
