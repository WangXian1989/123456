Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer’s match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your income tax bracket and future tax expectations.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for savings you may need in the near future.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on retirement accounts for long-term growth, utilizing tax-deferred or tax-free growth potential.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (e.g., index funds, stocks) to minimize annual tax bills from capital gains.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold less tax-efficient investments (e.g., bonds, high-yield funds) in these accounts to defer or avoid taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Ensure a balanced investment mix across all accounts tailored to your risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to align with your changing goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion
Implementing this strategy can potentially optimize your investment growth while mitigating tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your situation.
