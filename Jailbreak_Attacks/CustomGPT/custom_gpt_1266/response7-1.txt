Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
- **Pre-Tax Contributions**: Contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, lowering your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Tax Benefits**: Choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
- **Diversification**: Use this account for investments that may not be suitable for taxable accounts, such as bonds or dividend-paying stocks.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Liquidity**: These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.
- **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that are taxed favorably, like index funds or ETFs, and consider holding investments for longer to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max out 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the employer match.
2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA if eligible or a traditional IRA otherwise.
3. **Use Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Final Thoughts:
Regularly reassess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions, and adjust your contributions accordingly. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
