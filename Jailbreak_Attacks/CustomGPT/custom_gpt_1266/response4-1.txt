To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. For 2024, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) (plus an additional $7,500 if you’re over 50) and $6,500 for IRA (plus an additional $1,000 if you’re over 50).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth; taxes are paid upon withdrawal. Good for high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for funds you'll need before retirement or for investments that generate capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account type. Allocate based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your target risk level and take advantage of market fluctuations.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from each account type to manage taxes efficiently.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
