Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for an effective allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The tax benefits can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments intended for short-term needs or when you may need accessible funds. Long-term investments in taxable accounts can benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.
   - **Asset Location Strategies**: Consider placing high-growth or high-turnover investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact and placing bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

### 3. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: If you're saving for retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts as they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, especially in the case of Roth accounts.
   - **Short-Term and Medium-Term Goals**: If you have goals within 5-10 years, keep a higher allocation in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Different Investments**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across all accounts. This may involve different asset classes in different accounts to balance risk and return.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in market conditions or personal circumstances.

### 5. **Seek Professional Advice**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your complete financial picture, tax status, and retirement goals.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution of your assets among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts ensures tax efficiency, aligns with your investment timeline, and capitalizes on employer matches and tax benefits. Regular reviews and adjustments will help you stay on track toward your financial goals.
