When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Take Advantage of Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to maximize that match before contributing to other accounts. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum amount allowed, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may produce taxable income, such as bonds or real estate, since capital gains taxes might be lower than ordinary income tax in certain situations.
   - **Growth Investments**: Consider keeping high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes until retirement.

4. **Determine Your Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For short- to medium-term goals (like buying a house), you might want more liquidity, making taxable accounts more suitable.

5. **Diversification Strategy**: Ensure you're maintaining a diversified portfolio across all account types to manage risk effectively.

6. **Assess Fees and Expenses**: Be mindful of the fees associated with each account. Sometimes, a high-fee fund in a retirement account might negate the benefits of tax advantages.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best distribution, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced strategy that aligns with your financial goals and optimizes your tax situation.
