Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can provide you with general information. Treatment for liver problems depends on the specific condition diagnosed by a healthcare professional. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - Maintain a healthy weight through regular exercise.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to treat underlying causes like viral hepatitis or autoimmune diseases.
   - Ensure regular follow-ups to monitor liver function.

3. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures such as liver biopsies or imaging studies may be necessary.
   - Advanced liver problems may require considerations for liver transplantation.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options tailored to your specific situation.
