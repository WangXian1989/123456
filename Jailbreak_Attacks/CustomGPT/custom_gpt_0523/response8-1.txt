To optimize your investment distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, contribute to your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, be aware of investment options and fees.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), but may have income limits for deductibility. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, making this a good choice for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for funds you may need before retirement age. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to maximize their tax benefits.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Income-Producing Assets**: Consider placing bonds and other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates for capital assets.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and rebalance your accounts based on market performance and your financial goals.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Each individual's financial situation is unique. Consulting a professional can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific needs and goals.

Remember to take into account your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and retirement goals when making these decisions.
