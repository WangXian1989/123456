To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have access to a 401(k), especially one with a match, contribute a sufficient amount to get the match before focusing on other accounts.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider opening an IRA (Traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs give you the ability to defer taxes.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short-term savings goals or if you anticipate needing access to cash before retirement.

4. **Consider Investment Options**: Diversify your investments within each account. Generally, high-growth investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns and the tax implications on those gains. More stable investments (like bonds) can be suitable for taxable accounts to mitigate tax burdens on interest income.

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Consult with a financial advisor to understand how your current tax situation affects your investment strategy. Tax efficiency can play a crucial role in your overall strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your income or tax situation.

By starting with a solid foundation in tax-advantaged accounts and complementing it with an allocation to taxable accounts, you’ll be well-positioned for both growth and flexibility.
