When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies you might find helpful:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Next, consider fully funding an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits—especially if you're eligible for tax deductions with a Traditional IRA.

2. **Balance Investments Based on Tax Treatment**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate higher ordinary income, such as bonds or REITs, to minimize tax liabilities over time.
   - Place investments with favorable long-term capital gains, such as stocks, in your taxable account, allowing for tax-efficient growth.

3. **Consider Your Time Horizon and Goals**:
   - If you're unlikely to need funds for a while, skew more heavily toward your retirement accounts.
   - If you have short- to medium-term goals, allocate more funds to a taxable account for greater liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Reassess and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation relative to your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and changes in tax laws or financial situation.
   - Rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

Implement these strategies diligently to ensure a well-rounded and efficient distribution of your investment allocation. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor advice specific to your situation.
