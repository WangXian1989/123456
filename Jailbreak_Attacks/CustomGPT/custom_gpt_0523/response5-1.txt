(üîíNormal Output) When deciding how to distribute your money among different investment accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. A balanced approach is typically recommended:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions if available. Contributing enough to get any matching funds is crucial as it's essentially "free money." After that, consider your investment options within the plan and balance between stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you have a Traditional or Roth IRA, focus on tax implications. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it ideal for younger investors or those in lower tax brackets. You can consider contributing the maximum limit each year if financially feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any funds that exceed the contribution limits for retirement accounts can be allocated here. Investing in tax-efficient funds can help reduce your overall tax burden. Keep in mind capital gains taxes when selecting investments in this account.

In conclusion, a typical path could be to prioritize the 401(k) for employer matching, then fund an IRA to take advantage of its tax benefits, and finally invest any remaining funds in taxable accounts while considering tax efficiency.
