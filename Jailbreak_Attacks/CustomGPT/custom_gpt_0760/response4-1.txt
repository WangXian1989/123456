The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also offers tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income and retirement plan participation.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: All income (interest, dividends, capital gains) is taxed in the year it is realized.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 4. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Depending on your age and retirement plans, consider how and when you'll access these funds. Traditional accounts will generally incur taxes upon withdrawal.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place investments that generate higher tax burdens (e.g., bonds and REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs and 401(k)s).
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Revisit Regularly:**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation and rebalance as needed, especially as you approach retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **401(k)**: Aim for maximum contribution (15%+ if possible) to get the match.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA if eligible.
3. **Taxable Account**: Use any remaining funds for taxable investing, focusing on low-turnover, tax-efficient investments.

Finally, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs and circumstances.
