Distributing your money between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**:
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your employer match, evaluate how much you can contribute to each type of account:
     - **401(k)**: Use this for lower-cost investments and contributions of pre-tax income to reduce your current tax burden.
     - **IRA**: Choose traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions) based on your tax situation.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can be more flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals. Traditional 401(k) and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income during withdrawal, while Roth accounts are tax-free.

### 5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account, ensure a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Different accounts can have different investment strategies:
     - **401(k)**: Often limited to employer-selected funds.
     - **IRA**: Typically allows a wider range of investments.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you maintain a sufficient emergency fund separately, ideally covering 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.

### 7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of salary up to the employer match
- **Roth IRA**: Max out the contribution limit if eligible
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing out retirement contributions

Ultimately, a well-balanced approach that considers your unique financial situation will serve you best. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
