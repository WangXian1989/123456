Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match. If you're over 50, consider making catch-up contributions.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out any employer match, contribute to a tax-deferred IRA (Traditional) or after-tax IRA (Roth), depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that may generate capital gains or interest that aren't subject to immediate taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks might belong in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes, while bonds might fit better in tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Review and adjust your allocations annually or after major life events to stay aligned with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
