Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: Once you've secured the employer match, consider funding your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be particularly beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Return to the 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA contributions, direct any additional funds back to your 401(k). This is especially valuable for higher earners who might hit contribution limits sooner.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may provide liquidity or if you anticipate needing to access funds before retirement age without penalties. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to manage risk and take advantage of different tax treatments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially considering changing tax laws and your unique financial situation, a financial advisor can offer tailored guidance.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15% of your salary (to get the match fully)
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (currently $6,000 or $7,000 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds as necessary, using it for more immediate goals or supplemental retirement savings.

Review this strategy regularly based on market conditions and changes in your financial circumstances.
