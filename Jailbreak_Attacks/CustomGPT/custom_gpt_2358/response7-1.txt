Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, based on eligibility and your tax situation. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now.

2. **Emergency Fund and Immediate Needs**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in cash or a high-yield savings account before heavily investing.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate taxable income or capital gains. This includes funds that might be needed before retirement or to take advantage of lower tax brackets.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts for tax benefits.
   - Keep growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax when held for over a year.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Adjust your portfolio annually to maintain your desired allocation and risk profile.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your expected tax bracket in retirement and how distributions from different accounts will affect it.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investments while considering both growth and tax efficiency.
