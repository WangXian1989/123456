Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to maximize any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on withdrawals.

### 4. **Long-Term Growth Investments**:
   - Focus on equity investments in tax-advantaged accounts since their growth isn’t taxed until withdrawal (Traditional) or isn’t taxed at all (Roth).

### 5. **Short-Term Goals**:
   - Keep cash or fixed-income investments in taxable accounts for easier access without penalties.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might focus on growth (stocks), while those nearing retirement may want to shift to more stable investments (bonds).

### 7. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance periodically.

### Conclusion:
A diversified approach, prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining liquidity in taxable accounts, can optimize your financial growth. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
