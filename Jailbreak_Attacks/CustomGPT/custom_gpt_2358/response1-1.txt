Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions depending on your income.

3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This can provide flexibility, as money in these accounts is accessible without penalties.

4. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds) should be held in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds) can be held in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of how each investment can affect your current and future tax situation. For instance, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing Roth accounts might be wiser.

6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors can afford to take more risks, while those closer to retirement may want a more conservative allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
