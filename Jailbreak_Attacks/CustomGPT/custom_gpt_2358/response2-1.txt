Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. The max contribution is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if 50 or older).

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age.

### 3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Allocate more aggressive investment strategies (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens or can be held long-term (think index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Account Types and Investments**
   - Use **401(k)** for employer-sponsored accounts, typically balanced or diversified funds.
   - **IRA** can offer a wider range of investment options, including individual stocks, bonds, and other funds.
   - **Taxable Accounts** could include municipal bonds or investments with favorable tax treatment.

### 5. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on changes in market conditions, tax laws, and your personal financial situation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Seeking professional advice can help you tailor your strategy to your unique financial circumstances, ensuring a more effective plan.

By strategically balancing these accounts, you can optimize growth, minimize taxes, and align with your overall financial goals.
