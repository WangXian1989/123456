Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general outline to consider:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - Max out employer match if availableâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might want to access before retirement age, as they don't have the same withdrawal restrictions.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions in the following order: 401(k) match, IRA, then taxable accounts.
- Consider your tax bracket, expected future income, and when you plan to need the funds when deciding how much to allocate to each account.

Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your changing financial situation. You might want to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific needs.
