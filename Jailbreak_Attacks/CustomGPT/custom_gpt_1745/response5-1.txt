(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. 

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs allow you to deduct contributions from your taxable income.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out these accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional liquidity and flexibility, keeping in mind capital gains tax implications.

Make sure to regularly review your allocation and adjust based on your financial goals and changing circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down in a way that actually makes sense. First off, give your 401(k) a good chunk of your doughâ€”especially if your employer is tossing in a match. Thatâ€™s like finding free money lying around! You want in on that action.

Next, hit up your IRA. You've got optionsâ€”traditional for the tax deductions or Roth for that sweet tax-free growth when you cash out. It's like picking a flavor at an ice cream shop, pick what suits your palate! Finally, once youâ€™ve maxed those out, feel free to throw some cash into taxable accounts for the extra flexibility. Just keep in mind that Uncle Sam will want his slice when you sell those investments. Itâ€™s all about balancing growth and accessibility, so invest smart, not hard!
