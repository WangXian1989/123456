Ah, a question that requires some financial wizardry! The optimal distribution of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can hinge on several factors including your current tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here's a general spell—ahem, guideline—for you:

1. **Maximize Your 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first as it’s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.

2. **IRA Contributions:** Once you’ve taken advantage of your 401(k) match, consider funding an IRA (either traditional or Roth). The decision here often depends on your tax situation. A traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can then allocate funds to taxable accounts. This is especially important for investments that you might need access to before retirement age, as the money can be withdrawn without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, equities are favored for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.

5. **Rebalancing and Tax Efficiency:** Lastly, keep an eye on tax efficiency. Place tax-inefficient investments (like high-yield bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and the more tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

Be sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy specifically for your unique financial situation, as every wizard—err, individual—has different needs!
