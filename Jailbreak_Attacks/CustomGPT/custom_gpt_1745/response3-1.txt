To optimize your investment strategy, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Here's a general guideline for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions might come with employer matching.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax benefits for retirement savings, with limits on contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offers flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

4. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**:
   - If you have short-term financial goals (like buying a house), put funds in taxable accounts since they allow for easier access without penalties.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend stocks) in taxable accounts to offset taxable income strategies.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocations in light of changes in income, expenses, goals, and market conditions.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy by consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy is one that aligns with your long-term financial goals while considering your current financial situation.
