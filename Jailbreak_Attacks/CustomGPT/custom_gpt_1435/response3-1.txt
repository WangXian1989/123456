Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you have more funds after utilizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) to the maximum limit allowed.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement, as they offer more access without penalties. Invest in tax-efficient funds such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Diversification**
   - Across these accounts, ensure you have a diversified asset allocation that reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 6. **Tax Optimization**
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### 7. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and contributions and adjust as needed based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15%-20% of income (max employer match)
- **IRA**: Up to $6,500 annually (or $7,500 if 50+)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any remaining savings you want to invest for flexibility

Adjust these percentages based on your specific situation and financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
