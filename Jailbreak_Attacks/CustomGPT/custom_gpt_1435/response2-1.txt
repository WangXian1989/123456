Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out Contributions:** If you can, aim to max out your 401(k) contributions ($20,500 for 2023, with an additional $6,500 catch-up for those 50+).
   - **Investment Options:** Choose a diverse mix of investments that align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:**
     - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement. Good for those who anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Ideal for younger savers or those expecting higher taxes in the future.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Aim to contribute up to the maximum limit ($6,500 for 2023, with an additional $1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Supplementary Savings:** Use these accounts for additional savings for short- to mid-term goals, as they provide flexibility without penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which generate less taxable income.

### **Suggested Distribution Strategy**
1. **Prioritize Employer Match:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first.
2. **Max Out IRA:** Next, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions:** If you have funds left, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit.
4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Finally, allocate any remaining funds into a taxable account, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

### **Considerations**
- **Tax Bracket Awareness:** Keep an eye on your current and projected tax brackets.
- **Investment Strategy:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio as needed.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
For tailored advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you align your investment strategy with your personal financial goals.
