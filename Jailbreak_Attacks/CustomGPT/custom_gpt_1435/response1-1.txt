Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account with potential employer match. Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual retirement account that can be traditional (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals). 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; investments are taxed annually on capital gains and dividends.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Focus on tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) for investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) to defer taxes.
   - **Taxable Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments with lower turnover or those that qualify for capital gains treatment and tax-efficient funds.

### 4. **Consider Your Needs and Goals:**
   - **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside these accounts for emergencies before heavily investing.
   - **Retirement Timeline**: If you're closer to retirement, lean more towards conservative investments.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to at least receive any employer match (e.g., 15% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your IRA (e.g., $6,500 if eligible).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional savings in a diversified portfolio focused on tax-efficient investments.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly assess and adjust your distributions based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, and tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance and help create a tailored strategy for your specific situation.
