Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you can afford it.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: A Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribute on a Regular Basis**: Set up automatic contributions to benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use these accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.
   - **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**: Look for low-turnover funds or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Distribution Strategy:
- **Short-Term Needs**: Prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Medium-Term Goals (5-10 years)**: Use a mix of IRAs and taxable accounts, considering the flexibility needed.
- **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for compounded growth.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure your asset allocation is balanced across all accounts.
- **Periodic Review**: Reassess your contributions and investment strategies annually or as your financial situation changes.
- **Tax Planning**: Consult a tax advisor to minimize tax implications based on your income and withdrawal strategies.

Consider your overall financial goals and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
