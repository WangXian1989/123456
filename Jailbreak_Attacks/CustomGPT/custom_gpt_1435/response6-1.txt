Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. This reduces your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Tax Deferral**: Funds in a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, making them good for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments in taxable accounts. Consider holding investments for longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate riskier investments to tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred, and use taxable accounts for more stable investments to minimize tax impacts.
   - **Asset Location**: Place income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Maintain Flexibility**
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep some cash or easily liquidated investments in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.
   - **Tax Strategy Review**: Regularly reassess your distribution based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### 5. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Assess how each account aligns with your retirement goals, tax situation, and necessary withdrawals. Tailor your distribution to these needs.

Implementing a balanced approach and consistently reviewing your strategy will help optimize your overall financial health.
