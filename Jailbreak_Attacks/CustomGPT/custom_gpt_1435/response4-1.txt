Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for optimizing your tax situation and achieving your financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Contribute Enough**: Ensure you’re contributing enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k), especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Traditional contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, which can be beneficial in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs with low turnover. This helps minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Strategic Withdrawals**: In retirement, plan your withdrawals strategically to manage your tax bracket. Pull from tax-deferred accounts first, then taxable funds, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 4. **Diversification of Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among these accounts to manage risk and potential returns. Keep your riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to maximize your savings potential.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustments**
   - Periodically review your strategy as your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws change.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
