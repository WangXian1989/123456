Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible now, taxed later) or a Roth IRA (taxed now, tax-free later). Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are $23,000 for 401(k)s (if over age 50, add $7,500) and $6,500 for IRAs (add $1,000 if over age 50).

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay capital gains taxes when you sell investments. Consider placing investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Maintain a Diversified Portfolio**:
   - Allocate a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor the performance and reallocate as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawal strategies in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By strategically managing your contributions across these accounts, you can optimize growth while minimizing taxes.
