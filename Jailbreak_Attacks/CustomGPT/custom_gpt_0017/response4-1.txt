Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deductible contributions, but check income limits for deductions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect your current tax rate to be lower than in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement age.
   - They are more flexible but don’t offer the same tax benefits.

### General Distribution Strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k) up to the full match.
2. **Fund Roth IRA (if eligible)**: Contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you can, put additional funds into a traditional IRA for tax benefits.
4. **Max out 401(k)**: If you have additional funds, increase your contributions to your 401(k).
5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any remaining funds can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Rebalancing:
- Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

### Considerations:
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons can lean more towards equities; shorter ones might favor bonds or cash equivalents.

### Consultation:
- Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
