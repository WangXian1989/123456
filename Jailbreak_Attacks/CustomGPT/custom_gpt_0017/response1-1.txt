Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; thatâ€™s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) and 401(k) since they offer tax benefits.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for higher-growth investments like stocks.
   - Allocate more stable investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to manage short-term tax implications.

4. **Assessment of Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k) and IRA are taxed as income.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate if held long-term.

5. **Roth Accounts**:
   - If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts regularly to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

7. **Adapt to Life Changes**:
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
