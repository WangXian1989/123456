To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
- **Max out tax-advantaged accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fund your IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits, reducing your taxable income.
- **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for easier access and investment diversification.

### 2. **Investment Goals & Risk Tolerance**
- **Assess your goals**: Align contributions based on your time horizon. Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, while taxable accounts may be better for short- to medium-term goals.
- **Diversify investments**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, adjusting allocations based on your risk tolerance.

### 3. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
- **Rebalance periodically**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.

### 4. **Consider Contribution Limits**
- **Be aware of limits**: Maximize contributions within the annual limits for each account to optimize growth potential and tax implications.

By strategically balancing these accounts, you can enhance your financial growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
