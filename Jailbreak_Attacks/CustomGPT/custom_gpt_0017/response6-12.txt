I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Focus on a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Avoid alcohol consumption if it's contributing to the issue.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Anti-inflammatory Drugs**: To reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be considered.

Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and appropriate tests.
