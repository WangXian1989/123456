Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Often has employer matching, which you should aim to maximize.
     - Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):**
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Funds are subject to capital gains taxes when investments are sold. Ideal for an emergency fund or shorter-term goals.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Strategies:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Contribute to your 401(k) and traditional IRA first for tax deferral.
   - **Roth Accounts:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. This is also beneficial for younger investors with lower income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for savings goals timelines of 5 years or less, as you can withdraw without penalties.

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize tax benefits.
   - Hold income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Assess your allocations annually based on your changing financial goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider professional advice tailored to your specific circumstances for optimal asset allocation.

### Sample Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out any employer match first, then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account:** Use remaining funds for short- to medium-term goals, investing in diversified assets.

By thinking through these aspects, you can create a balanced approach that suits your financial landscape.
