Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match first, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want to lower taxable income now, or a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and don't have contribution limits, but remember that investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Tax Impact**: Stay mindful of how distributions from each type of account will affect your tax situation, especially in retirement.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation periodically to adapt to changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
