To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k):** Often has employer matching contributions; ideal for higher contributions.
- **IRA:** Provides tax advantages, including deductions and tax-deferred growth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
- **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match.
- **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income, consider maxing out traditional or Roth IRA contributions for tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional savings once tax-advantaged accounts are maximized.

### 3. Diversify Investments
- **Equities vs. Bonds:** Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Growth investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

### Conclusion
Choose allocation methods that reflect your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Regularly review and adjust your distributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.
