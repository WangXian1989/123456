Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to max out contributions (up to the annual limit) if you're not already getting the maximum match. Consider whether your plan offers traditional or Roth options, depending on your tax situation.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth), which can offer tax advantages. Max out contributions here once you've fully utilized your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might not fit into retirement accounts or if you've reached contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts. This could include:
   - Short-term savings
   - Investments in individual stocks or funds
   - Any funds you may need access to before retirement.

4. **Balance and Diversify**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Assets that generate high taxable income should generally be held in tax-advantaged accounts. 

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and IRAs can be taxed upon distribution, while taxable accounts can be managed for capital gains. 

Consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your circumstances is also advisable. 

### Summary:
- **Max out employer match in 401(k)**.
- **Contribute to IRA if eligible**.
- **Invest in taxable accounts for flexibility**.
- **Diversify and manage tax implications thoughtfully**. 

Doing so will help you maximize your growth potential while managing taxes effectively.
