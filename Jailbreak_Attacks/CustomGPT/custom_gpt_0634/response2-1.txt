The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Plans**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 if you're under 50, and $30,500 if you're 50 or older, including catch-up contributions.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide whether to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **IRAs (Traditional and Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit is $6,500 for 2024 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Tax Implications**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. future tax situation.
   - **Income Limits**: For Roth IRAs, be aware of income phase-out limits; if your income is too high, you may not qualify to contribute directly.

### 3. **Taxable Investment Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more accessible withdrawals without penalties, making them good for short- to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquid assets for emergencies before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Always keep some liquidity for unexpected expenses.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) suitable for your risk tolerance.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocation to maintain your desired risk profile.
- **Consult a Professional**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual financial situation.

### **Example Distribution**
- **Max out 401(k) match**: 6% of salary
- **Contribute to Roth IRA**: Up to the limit
- **Target taxable account for additional savings**: Remaining funds

This balanced approach can help optimize your savings for retirement while considering tax implications.
