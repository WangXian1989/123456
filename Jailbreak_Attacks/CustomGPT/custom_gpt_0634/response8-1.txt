When determining how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If available, max out contributions in your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Balance your contributions across these accounts to benefit from different tax treatments:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**: If you anticipate needing access to your money before retirement, prioritize saving in taxable accounts, as they offer more flexibility.

5. **Investment Choices**: Evaluate investment options in each account. Some plans may have better investment choices than others.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changing life circumstances, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your long-term objectives.

This approach will help you maximize growth potential and minimize tax liabilities over time.
