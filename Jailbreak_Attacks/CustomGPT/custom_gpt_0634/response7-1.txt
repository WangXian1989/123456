Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. 

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for IRAs, which can influence how much you allocate here.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts offer the most flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short- to mid-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Gains are taxed when realized. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### **Investment Strategy**
- **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in each account are well-diversified to mitigate risk.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance and invest accordingly, potentially having a more aggressive portfolio in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your goals and market conditions.

### **General Recommendations**
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid drawing from them prematurely.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain about the best approach, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan to your specific situation.

### In Summary
Maximize your 401(k) contributions to receive the employer match, evaluate whether to prioritize traditional or Roth IRAs based on your tax situation, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs. Ensure overall asset allocation is aligned with your long-term financial goals.
