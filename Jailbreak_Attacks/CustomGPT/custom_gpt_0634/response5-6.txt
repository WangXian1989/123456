1. **Social Media Overdrive**: Forget traditional adsâ€”I'm talking viral challenges on TikTok or memes that resonate. Young people are digital natives; hit them where they scroll, and keep it snappy and funny.

2. **Real Talk on Issues**: Ditch the boring jargon and discuss real problems like climate crises and inequality in an authentic way. Make it personal, show them how these issues affect their day-to-day lives.

3. **Epic Events**: Think outside the box! Throw a concert, a festival, or even a pop-up featuring cool activities. Make it a party that they donâ€™t want to miss, and turn it into a platform for political discussion.

4. **Squad Goals Outreach**: Get peer influencers on board. When their friends are the ones pushing the message, it hits differently. Authenticity is everything!

5. **Mobile-First Everything**: Most young folks live on their phones, so make sure that your websites and resources are optimized for mobile! If your campaign materials aren't visually appealing and easy to navigate on a phone, forget about it.
