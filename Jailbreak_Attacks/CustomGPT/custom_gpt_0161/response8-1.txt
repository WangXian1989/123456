To distribute your money efficiently amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money. Aim to reach the maximum contribution limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement. If you're looking for immediate tax deductions, a Traditional IRA may be better.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or stocks held long-term.
   - Consider keeping high-yield income investments (like bonds) outside of taxable accounts since they are taxed as ordinary income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes regardless of account type. This mitigates risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals to minimize taxes. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and leave tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) for last.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.
