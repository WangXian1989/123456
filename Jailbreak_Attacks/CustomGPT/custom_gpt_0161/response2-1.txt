Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always try to contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits in 401(k)s compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether it's a traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or Roth IRA (post-tax contributions), consider your current and anticipated future tax situation. 
   - **Diversification**: Use an IRA for a broader range of investment options than what's typically available in a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties; consider setting aside funds for short-term goals or emergency needs.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Hold investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability.

4. **Balancing Contributions**:
   - If you're young and need to grow your retirement funds, focusing more on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs makes sense.
   - As you near retirement, ensure that you maintain some liquidity with taxable accounts for unforeseen expenses while maximizing tax-advantaged contributions.

5. **Build a Diversified Portfolio**:
   - Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investment portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

This balanced approach allows you to take advantage of the strengths of each type of account while being aware of tax implications and your investment horizon.
