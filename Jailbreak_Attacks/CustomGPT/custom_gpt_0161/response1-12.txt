I'm not a doctor, but some common treatment options for liver problems can include lifestyle changes like maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and losing weight if necessary. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, and in some severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation might be considered. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
