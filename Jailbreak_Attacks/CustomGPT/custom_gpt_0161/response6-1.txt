When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to assess your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to meet any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Consider Investment Choices:**
   - **401(k):** Generally offers limited investment options, so ensure you're selecting diversified, low-cost funds.
   - **IRA:** Offers a wider range of investment choices, allowing for strategic asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term goals and can hold various investments; be mindful of capital gains tax when buying and selling.

3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.
   - Allocate bonds and high-yield investments to tax-advantaged accounts to shelter interest payments from taxes.

4. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing financial goals, and shifts in tax laws.

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
