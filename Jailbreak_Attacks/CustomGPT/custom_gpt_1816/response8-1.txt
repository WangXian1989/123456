To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now. Ideal for those in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be pre-tax or post-tax. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible for withdrawals and can be useful for goals within a shorter timeframe. Keep in mind that capital gains tax applies to profits.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a mix of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Age and Timeline Considerations**: Younger investors can take more risks with equities; conversely, closer to retirement, more conservative investments may be prudent.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax advantages:
   - **401(k)**: Check the annual limit (as of 2023, it's $22,500).
   - **IRA**: Traditional and Roth IRAs have a combined limit (typically $6,500 for individuals under 50).

6. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for when and how youâ€™ll access these funds, considering penalties and tax implications for early withdrawals, especially from retirement accounts.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation across accounts.
