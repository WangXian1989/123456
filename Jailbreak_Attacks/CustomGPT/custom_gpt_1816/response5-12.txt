I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific condition affecting your liver. Common options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.
3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular follow-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or advanced cirrhosis, surgical options like liver transplant may be considered.

Always discuss thoroughly with your healthcare provider for a tailored approach.

If you have specific symptoms or a diagnosis in mind, I can provide more general information on that as well!
