The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers employer matching and has higher contribution limits. Contributions are often pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be either traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (post-tax contributions). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but investment gains are subject to taxes, making it less tax-efficient for long-term investment.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize 401(k) Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider an IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA may be beneficial. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer upfront tax deductions.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for excess funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and traditional IRAs can be advantageous.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your risk tolerance for each account. Generally, more aggressive investments can be held in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your total portfolio aligns with your risk preferences, with diversification across accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach typically involves:
- **Maxing out your 401(k) contributions (especially employer match first).**
- **Contributing to an IRA if you're eligible.**
- **Allocating any remaining funds to taxable accounts.**

Consider consulting a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your specific circumstances.
