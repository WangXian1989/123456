Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Aim to contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Consider the annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: Decide based on your tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Max Out Contributions**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for catch-up contributions).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Consider taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access in the short term, or once you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Steps:
- **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that down first.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a liquid account.
- **Investment Strategy**: Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you optimize your strategy based on your specific financial situation.

### Summary:
Start with employer-sponsored plans, maximize tax-advantaged accounts, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Regularly review your strategy based on life changes and financial goals.
