Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to help you strategize your distribution:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Action:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Strategy:** If you can, fully fund your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar benefits as a 401(k) with potential tax deductions.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any capital gains or dividends are subject to taxes in the year they are realized. Consider using these for investments that generate long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth through diversified investments such as stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use this for shorter-term needs or investments that may have more volatility, like individual stocks or ETFs. 

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - **Tax-Effective Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider placing assets that generate capital gains (for long-term holding) or yield (like municipal bonds) here.
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth investments in your 401(k) or IRA to maximize tax benefits.

### 6. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - **Younger Investors:** May favor higher risk (more stocks) as there’s time to recover from market fluctuations.
   - **Closer to Retirement:** Shift toward more conservative investments (bonds, stable funds).

### 7. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances.

### Example Distribution
- **Young Investor (30 years old):**
  - 401(k): Max contributions for employer match + 10% of salary.
  - IRA: Max contributions to Roth IRA if eligible.
  - Taxable: 10-20% for immediate goals or short-term investments.
  
- **Near Retirement (55 years old):**
  - 401(k): Max contributions focusing on a more balanced approach.
  - IRA: Contribute to a traditional IRA if tax-deductible, otherwise consider Roth.
  - Taxable: 20-30% for liquidity and shorter-term needs.

Ultimately, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
