Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax Contributions**: If your 401(k) is traditional, contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **Investment Options**: Assess the fund options within the plan to ensure they align with your risk tolerance.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits ($6,500 for individuals under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older as of 2023).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Use for short-term goals or emergency funds, as they can be accessed without penalty.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Be cautious about frequent trading, which can result in higher tax liabilities.

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize 401(k) up to the match**: Capture employer contributions first.
- **Then max out IRA contributions**: Provide a diverse set of tax advantages.
- **Lastly, contribute to a taxable account**: Use for any additional investments or savings goals.

### **Review and Adjust**
Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal financial goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your unique situation.
