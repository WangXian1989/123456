Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider putting additional funds into your taxable accounts. These can offer flexibility for short-term goals and may have different tax implications.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts to manage risk:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher-growth investments (like stocks).
   - Reserve more conservative investments (like bonds) for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals:
   - Withdrawals from your 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Long-term capital gains from taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts in a pinch.

7. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation as your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
