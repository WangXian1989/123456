To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA may offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows tax-deferred growth.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep investments that have lower turnover or tax implications (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Monitor Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

5. **Adjust Based on Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, focusing on tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) may be more beneficial. If expecting to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA could be more advantageous.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a balanced allocation among stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

7. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically assess your overall portfolio. Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation.

By prioritizing tax advantages and aligning with your retirement goals, you can optimize your investment distribution across these account types. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
