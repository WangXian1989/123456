Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money).
     - Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it provides tax-free growth.
     - If higher income, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Evaluate Investment Options**
   - **401(k):**
     - Often has limited investment choices; prioritize low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA:**
     - More flexibility; choose a diverse range of investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs).
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds or ETFs).
     - Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Consider tax implications of withdrawals based on your expected income in retirement.
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for early withdrawals due to penalties.

### Summary
- **Prioritize Contributions:** Max out tax-advantaged accounts first.
- **Diversify Across Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments with low turnover.
- **Review and Adjust:** Regularly reassess your allocations based on market conditions and personal circumstances. 

By following this strategy, you can optimize your investments for tax efficiency and growth.
