To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Funds in 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts grow tax-deferred. Contribute to these first, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate capital gains, as they can be more tax-efficient for certain investments.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match in your 401(k), focus on contributing to your IRA (both traditional and Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - Distribute remaining funds to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment timeline when choosing how to allocate between these accounts. Typically:
     - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments.
     - **IRA**: A mix of growth and conservative investments depending on longer-term goals.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Keep a balance of bonds and stocks to manage taxes effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio according to market changes and personal financial goals.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies to your unique situation. 

This approach ensures a comprehensive, tax-efficient strategy for your retirement savings and investments.
