To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** For high earners, contributing to a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA can reduce taxable income in the current year. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) may be more beneficial.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure your investments within each account are diversified according to your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Generally, higher-risk investments can be held in accounts meant for long-term growth, while more conservative investments may be better suited for nearer-term goals.

5. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, as they tend to generate fewer taxable distributions. Use tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

6. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your investment allocation and make adjustments as needed to keep aligned with your long-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Consider seeking personalized advice based on your individual financial situation and goals, especially for complex decisions involving tax implications.

By carefully managing how you distribute your funds, you can optimize your overall investment strategy and potentially increase your financial growth in the long term.
