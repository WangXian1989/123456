When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to keep in mind:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax advantages that can grow your savings more effectively over time.

2. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to capture the full match before directing funds to other accounts.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility, tax brackets, and future tax rate expectations. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This allows for greater flexibility in accessing funds, though youâ€™ll need to consider capital gains taxes.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. You might want to take a more aggressive approach in your 401(k) and IRA while keeping your taxable accounts more conservative, due to tax implications on withdrawals.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your investments and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial goals and needs, ensuring you make the best decisions for your situation.
