I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you first consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan for liver problems. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition you have, but they could include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications to manage symptoms, or in some cases, procedures like surgery. Always prioritize getting advice from a trusted medical expert.
