When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to keep in mind:

1. **401(k) Contributions:** Start by maximizing your contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) if they offer an employer match. This is essentially free money, so aim to contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA Contributions:** After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose the type that aligns with your current and expected future tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, then allocate money to taxable accounts. These accounts are more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalty, but keep in mind the tax implications on the gains.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation:** Determine your overall asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets in all account types.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Each account type has different tax implications, so it's important to strategize how and when you will use these assets.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution plan that fits your unique financial situation and goals.
