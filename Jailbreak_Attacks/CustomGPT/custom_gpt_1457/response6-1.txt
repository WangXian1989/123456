When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Contribute to your 401(k) up to the employer match to benefit from free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you have a Roth option, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency:**
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.
   - Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts where they're already taxed at ordinary income rates.

3. **Balance According to Financial Goals:**
   - Assess your time horizon. For long-term growth, allocate more to 401(k) and IRA. For short-term needs, consider more in taxable accounts.
   - Re-evaluate your asset allocation periodically to align with changing life circumstances and market conditions.

Ultimately, a tailored approach based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation will guide your distribution strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations.
