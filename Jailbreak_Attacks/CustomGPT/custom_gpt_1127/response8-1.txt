To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions to your traditional or Roth IRA based on eligibility. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawal flexibility.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate regular income (like bonds) to take advantage of lower capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a consistent asset allocation across all accounts. Avoid clustering all riskier investments in one account; instead, diversify.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your financial situation, especially regarding tax implications.

By balancing contributions and taking a strategic approach, you can optimize your overall investment growth and minimize taxes.
