Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
- **Consider Contributions**: Choose between traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) contributions based on your tax bracket and future expectations.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
- **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
- **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might require liquidity, such as saving for short- to medium-term goals.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Choose tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### **Considerations**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings set aside for emergencies before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all account types.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **Retirement Focus**: 401(k) up to match → Max IRA → Taxable accounts.
- **Short-term Goals**: More funds in taxable accounts for accessibility.

### Tax Planning
- Allocate investments with high expected returns to tax-advantaged accounts and consider using tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts.

This framework should help you think strategically about your money distribution. Always consider personal circumstances and consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
