Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and financial goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is free money!). Aim to max out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider funding a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that are likely to produce long-term capital gains (lower tax rates) and tax-efficient funds. This is also where you can hold assets you might need early, since they are more accessible without penalties.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance across all account types, with a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to ensure growth and stability.

### 4. **Adjust Over Time**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
