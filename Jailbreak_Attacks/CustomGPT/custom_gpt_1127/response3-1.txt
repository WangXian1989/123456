Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA can lower your taxable income, while a Roth IRA grows tax-free.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Keep higher-growth investments, like stocks, here to benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you’re in a lower tax bracket, contributing to a Roth IRA could be beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be wiser.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Ensure your overall portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
