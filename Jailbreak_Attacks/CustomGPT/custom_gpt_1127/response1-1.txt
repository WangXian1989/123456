To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider contributing more if you havenâ€™t maxed out the account.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Keep in mind tax implications when planning withdrawals in retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
