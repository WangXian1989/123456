To decide the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to maximize your annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you prefer traditional IRAs, you may benefit from tax deductions now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate capital gains, as they can be taxed at lower rates. Favor investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term holdings).

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for growth. Consider higher-risk investments here since they benefit from compounding over time.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Maintain enough in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals in Retirement:**
   - Use withdrawals strategically from these accounts to minimize tax impact. For example, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts before tax-advantaged ones to manage taxable income.

5. **Regularly Reassess Your Allocation:**
   - Keep adjusting based on market performance, lifestyle changes, and retirement goals.

By strategically balancing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your portfolio for growth and tax efficiency in both the short and long term.
