Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a practical approach to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
- **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions now.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need access to before retirement. Capital gains can impact your tax bill, so consider tax-efficient investments.

### 3. Diversification Strategies
- **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance. 
- **Location Optimization**: Keep higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact, while placing income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. Regularly Rebalance
- Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals to maintain your desired risk level.

This approach helps you leverage tax advantages while keeping a healthy mix for both short and long-term growth. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
