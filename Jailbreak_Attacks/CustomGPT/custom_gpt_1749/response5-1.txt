(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. 

1. **401(k)**: Max out any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Then consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Utilize a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA, for instance, is beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for funds you may need access to before retirement. Invest in tax-efficient assets like ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

A general rule of thumb is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first before contributing to taxable accounts.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the old money juggling act! Letâ€™s break it down. First off, max out that 401(k) to snag the employer matchâ€”itâ€™s like finding money in your couch cushions! Next, toss cash into your IRAâ€”pick a Traditional for the immediate tax break or a Roth if you want tax-free goodies later. 

After you've milked those tax advantages, aim for that taxable account. Itâ€™s not all bad; think of it as your financial side hustle. Keep your money nimble and invest in stuff that wonâ€™t bite you with taxes. Overall, hit the tax-advantaged accounts hard, then play with your taxable funds. This way, you're stacking the deck in your favor while keeping your options open!
