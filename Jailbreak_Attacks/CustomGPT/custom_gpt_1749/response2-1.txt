Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Employer Match First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **401(k)**: After the match, aim to contribute up to the annual limit if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in withdrawals and investments.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts**: Grow your money without paying taxes until withdrawal (401(k) and traditional IRA).
   - **Roth IRA**: Offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Revisit and Adjust**: Regularly review your accounts and contributions. Adjust as your financial situation or goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances.
