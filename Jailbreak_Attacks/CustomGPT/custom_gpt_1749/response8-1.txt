Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income level, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the limit (or at least get the match). Consider a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs have tax-free growth, while contributions to traditional IRAs may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a savings account before investing.

5. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocations annually or after major life changes to ensure they align with your goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
