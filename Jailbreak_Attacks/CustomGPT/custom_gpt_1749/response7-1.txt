To distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Next, consider maximizing your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income tax situation and future plans.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. They allow for flexibility and easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Keep in mind the asset allocation that suits your risk tolerance across all accounts. Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds) and taxable accounts for more liquid investments (bonds, cash).

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly check and adjust your asset allocation in all accounts to ensure it aligns with your goals.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - For retirement, remember that 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as income, while Roth IRA withdrawals (if qualified) and capital gains from taxable accounts may have different tax implications.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA**: Contribute up to the maximum limit if possible.
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings or investments beyond those limits.

This approach balances tax advantages with liquidity and savings growth. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
