Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Roth 401(k) contributions are post-tax but grow tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions**
   - **Contribute to a 401(k)**: Aim for the maximum contribution limit, especially if you have a high-income year.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Generally focus on long-term growth through stocks.
   - **IRA**: Choose a mix that reflects your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Monitor your investments and adjust your strategy as needed based on market conditions and life changes.

### Conclusion
The best strategy often involves a balance tailored to your specific situation. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
