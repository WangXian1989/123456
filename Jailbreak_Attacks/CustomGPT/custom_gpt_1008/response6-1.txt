To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out any employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Your choice should reflect your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for funds you may need before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Allocate more to your taxable account if you may need access to funds before retirement.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio remains diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash).
   - Adjust the risk level based on the account type; typically, you might take on more risk in retirement accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **Max out 401(k)** to take advantage of employer matching and pre-tax benefits.
- **Contribute to an IRA** for additional tax-advantaged growth and choose between a Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Use taxable accounts** for investing in a diversified, tax-efficient manner, focusing on investments that generate lower taxable income (like qualified dividends).

### Regular Review
- Reassess your allocation annually based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and investment performance.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively.
