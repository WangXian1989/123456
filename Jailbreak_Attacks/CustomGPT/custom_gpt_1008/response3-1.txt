Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, these limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $23,000 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older)
     - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older)

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.
   - Diversify investments to manage tax implications. For example, you might want to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient assets (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your investment strategy and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, or market conditions.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Seeking personalized advice from a financial advisor can help align your investment strategy with your specific circumstances and goals.

Ultimately, the best distribution will vary based on your individual situation, so consider these factors to create a tailored plan.
