To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may also provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. They provide flexibility for accessing funds but may not offer the same tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Start with employer-sponsored plans like your 401(k) to get the maximum match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Next, consider maximizing contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your income and tax situation.
   - After reaching these limits, use leftover funds for your taxable account for liquidity and financial flexibility.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure you have a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts. Tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) may be better held in tax-advantaged accounts, while tax-efficient investments (like index funds) can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your asset allocation and tax situation annually to adjust contributions based on changing goals and market conditions.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A tailored strategy from a professional can provide personalized insight based on your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

This balanced approach can help maximize your savings and minimize taxes over your lifetime.
