To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

### 1. Assess Your Financial Goals
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. 
   - Consider factors like retirement age, desired retirement lifestyle, and any major purchases.

### 2. Understand Account Types
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions; tax-deferred growth until withdrawal during retirement.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but provide liquidity and flexibility; capital gains taxes apply to profits.

### 3. Prioritize Contributions
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA if eligible, especially a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - After that, contribute additional funds to your 401(k) or taxable accounts as needed.

### 4. Diversify Investments
   - Within each account type, maintain a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider employing different investment strategies for taxable accounts due to tax implications (e.g., holding long-term investments).

### 5. Review and Rebalance
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations and adjust as needed based on market performance, changing financial circumstances, and tax considerations.

### 6. Consult a Financial Advisor
   - If you're unsure about specifics regarding tax implications or investment choices, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of salary, maximizing any employer match.
- **IRA**: Up to the annual limit (e.g., $6,500 for 2023 if under 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds after contributions to retirement accounts.

Adjust these percentages based on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial goals.
