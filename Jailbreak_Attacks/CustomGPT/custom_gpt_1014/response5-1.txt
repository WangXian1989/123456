(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you are eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxed income (like qualified dividends) and to maintain flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties.

Overall, focus on tax-advantaged accounts first, and then supplement with taxable accounts as needed.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's dive in! Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k) First**: Get your employer match locked downâ€”think of it as finding cash in your couch cushions. Donâ€™t leave that on the table!
2. **Roth or Traditional IRA**: Next up, smash your IRA contributionsâ€”getting that sweet, sweet tax advantage is clutch. Roth IRAs are golden for tax-free withdrawals later, so if you can swing it, go for Roth!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve maxed out those tax-advantaged accounts, turn to taxable accounts. Just remember, the gains here can hit you with taxes, so keep an eye on what youâ€™re investing inâ€”stick to lower-tax stuff as much as possible.

In short, stack up your 401(k) and IRA and then look at your taxable accountsâ€”because who wants to pay more taxes than necessary, am I right?
