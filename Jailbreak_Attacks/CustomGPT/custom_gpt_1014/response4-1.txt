The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Benefits**: Often offers employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.
   - **Drawbacks**: Limited investment options and penalties for withdrawals before retirement age (59Â½).
   - **Strategy**: Maximize employer contributions, especially if there's a match. Consider contributing enough to get the full match before investing in other accounts.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Benefits**: Offers tax-deferred growth, and a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. More flexible investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - **Drawbacks**: Contribution limits and early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Strategy**: Depending on your income level, choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it after contributing to your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Benefits**: No contribution limits and greater flexibility in terms of withdrawals. You can invest in a wide variety of assets.
   - **Drawbacks**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - **Strategy**: Use this account for investments you expect to hold for the long term to minimize tax liabilities. It may also be beneficial to keep emergency funds or short-term savings here.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Start with Maxing Out Employer Match** in your 401(k).
- **Max out IRA contributions** (especially if you qualify for a Roth).
- **Next, contribute to taxable accounts**, if you have any surplus income after the above.

### General Framework:
1. **Assess your emergency fund** to ensure liquidity.
2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** for retirement savings.
3. **Rebalance annually** to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

### Professional Advice:
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your approach based on your unique circumstances.

Always keep in mind your personal financial goals and timelines when deciding on allocation.
