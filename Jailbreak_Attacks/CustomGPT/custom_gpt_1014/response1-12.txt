I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general strategies that might help with liver health. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver health and detect any worsening conditions early.

4. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions such as diabetes or high cholesterol can help reduce liver strain.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Reducing exposure to harmful substances, such as certain drugs and chemicals, is essential for liver health.

Always consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your situation.
