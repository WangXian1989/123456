Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider for optimal allocation:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great first step.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If you're in a higher tax bracket now, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free. Depending on your income, you may want to prioritize these as well.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide more flexibility and access to your money, but they don’t offer the same tax benefits. It’s typically wise to hold assets that generate substantial interest or dividends in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes.
   
### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Generally, higher-risk investments like stocks are better suited for long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) because you have more time to recover from market fluctuations. Conversely, bonds may be more appropriate for taxable accounts, as they often generate regular income that is subject to tax.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Keep an eye on your portfolio allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - Short-term vs. long-term goals should dictate where you invest. If you're close to retirement, prioritize liquid savings and income-generating investments.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - A financial advisor can tailor a plan based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

#### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income to maximize employer match
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed each year
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings for liquidity and flexibility

By developing a strategy that accounts for your current financial situation and future goals, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investments and minimizes tax burdens.
