Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach on how to allocate your funds across these accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: After securing any employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs may provide tax-deductible contributions, and Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you can still contribute after maxing out your IRA, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k). The contribution limits are typically higher than those for an IRA, giving you the opportunity to save more for retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve taken advantage of tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can provide you with more flexibility since you can access these funds before retirement without penalties. Additionally, investments in taxable accounts may qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change over time. Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as necessary to stay on track with your retirement plans.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor may also help tailor a strategy that best suits your personal financial situation and objectives.
