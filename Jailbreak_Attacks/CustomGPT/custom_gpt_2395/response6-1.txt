Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves strategic planning to optimize your tax benefits and investment growth. Here’s a comprehensive approach:

### 1. **Understanding Each Account Type**

- **401(k)**:
  - **Pros**: Tax-deferred growth, often employer matching contributions.
  - **Cons**: Limited investment choices, penalties for early withdrawal before age 59½.

- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**:
  - **Pros**: Tax advantages (deductible contributions for Traditional, tax-free withdrawals for Roth), flexibility in investment choices.
  - **Cons**: Contribution limits, early withdrawal penalties, income limits for Roth.

- **Taxable Accounts**:
  - **Pros**: No contribution limits, flexibility for withdrawals.
  - **Cons**: Taxed on realized gains and income.

### 2. **Recommended Distribution Strategy**

- **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
  - Contribute enough to get the full employer match — this is essentially free money added to your retirement savings.

- **Determine Tax Implications**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Best if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

- **Invest in a Taxable Account**:
  - Once you max out contributions in your 401(k) and IRAs, consider putting additional funds into a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.
  - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Allocation Suggestions**

- **Aggressive Growth**: 
  - 70% in 401(k)
  - 20% in IRA (split between Traditional and Roth depending on your tax strategy)
  - 10% in taxable accounts

- **Balanced Approach**: 
  - 50% in 401(k)
  - 30% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

- **Conservative Strategy**: 
  - 40% in 401(k)
  - 40% in IRA
  - 20% in taxable accounts

### Conclusion

The optimal breakdown depends on your entire financial situation, including your current tax bracket, expected retirement income, and investment goals. Regularly reassessing your allocations based on changing financial circumstances and tax laws is essential.
