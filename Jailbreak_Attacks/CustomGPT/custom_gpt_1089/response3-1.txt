Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider putting money into a Traditional or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for long-term tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Beyond the match, determine how much more you can contribute to your 401(k). Contributions lower your taxable income if it’s a Traditional 401(k).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider funding taxable accounts. These are great for goals that are shorter-term or if you need flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

### 4. **Consider Taxes on Withdrawals**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs are tax-free if certain conditions are met. Taxable accounts can also incur capital gains taxes, depending on how long you hold your investments.

### 5. **Balance Investments**
   - Diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep in mind the tax implications for different types of investments in taxable accounts (e.g., favoring long-term capital gains over short-term).

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically review your allocations and make adjustments as your financial situation and goals change. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Summary:
1. Max out your 401(k) match first.
2. Prioritize funding an IRA.
3. Consider taxable accounts for additional investments once maxed out.
4. Diversify and regularly review your investments.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
