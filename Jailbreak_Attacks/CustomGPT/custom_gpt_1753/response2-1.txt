Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deferment or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your tax situation and income limits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **High-Income Years:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA can be advantageous as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Lower-Income Years:** Contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be beneficial, allowing for a deduction now and taxes during retirement when you might be in a lower bracket.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure you have a balanced portfolio across all accounts that reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - **Investment Types:** Use your taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, and save riskier assets for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Think Long-Term:**
   - Prioritize funding your accounts based on retirement timeline and immediate cash needs. Younger individuals may take more risks in their investments, while those closer to retirement might shift to more conservative allocations.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor performance and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your entire financial picture, including future plans and any changes in income or expenses.

Always consider your unique situation, as these strategies can vary based on individual goals and needs.
