When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing this out if you are in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Itâ€™s valuable if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This is great if you expect your tax rates to increase in the future.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you have maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These are useful for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in case of emergencies before you heavily invest in less liquid retirement accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across account types. For example, you might hold more bonds in a taxable account to minimize taxes on interest, while keeping growth-oriented stocks in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Taxable accounts may be more sensitive to capital gains taxes when rebalancing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** For personalized advice, especially to address your specific financial situation, consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy that aligns with your financial goals.

Overall, the key is to take advantage of tax benefits while maintaining a balanced investment approach that fits your risk tolerance and long-term objectives.
