Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but usually with lower contribution limits.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax and dividends are taxed in the year theyâ€™re received.

3. **Time Horizon**: If you're investing for the long term (e.g., retirement), you might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may offer more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are balanced across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: In retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. Typically, it's advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally from Roth accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, it may be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Assess your situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals to create a distribution strategy that works best for you!
