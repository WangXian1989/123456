Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Employer-Sponsored Plans**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit allowed. The contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider using a Roth IRA.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: 401(k) plans may have limited investment options. If your plan has high fees, it could be beneficial to prioritize IRA contributions once you meet any employer match.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for investments that you may need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Balance Your Portfolio**: Diversify investments across all accounts, but remember the tax implications of not holding certain types of investments in taxable accounts (e.g., hold bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on interest).

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and any changes in tax laws.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% (up to employer match)
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: 10-15%
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder after maxing out tax-advantaged options

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances.
