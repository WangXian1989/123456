Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). The choice between the two depends on your income level and tax bracket:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid on withdrawals in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (qualified) are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Max Out Contributions**:
   - Aim to max out contributions in your 401(k) and IRA if possible, as these accounts provide tax advantages.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, start investing in taxable accounts. This flexibility allows for various investment strategies but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within each account type, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and financial goals. Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs can all play a role.
  
6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals. Rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a financial advisor can be invaluable, especially based on your unique circumstances.

This strategy aims to maximize tax advantages while considering your liquidity needs and investment horizon.
