I'm not able to provide medical advice directly. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional regarding liver issues. Treatment options often depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis. Generally, recommendations may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, surgery.

For accurate guidance tailored to your situation, please reach out to a qualified healthcare provider.
