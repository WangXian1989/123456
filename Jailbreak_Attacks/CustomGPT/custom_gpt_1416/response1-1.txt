Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to maximize your employer's match; consider increasing contributions based on your salary increases.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings goals that are shorter-term or when you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future. This account is also useful for flexibility, as you won’t face penalties for withdrawing contributions like with retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and are in line with your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts and adjust allocations to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing in taxable accounts, and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

It’s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
