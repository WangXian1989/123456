Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some steps to guide you:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored plan that often has matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be either traditional or Roth. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments that donâ€™t offer tax advantages. You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Target:** How soon do you need to access these funds? For longer-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Investment Horizon:** Consider your risk tolerance and how long you can leave the money invested.

### 3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) to minimize current tax liability.
   - Be aware of the tax implications in taxable accounts, especially capital gains, and consider tax-efficient investing strategies.

### 4. **Contribution Limits:**
   - Stay informed about contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to ensure you're maximizing benefits.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments within each account. Consider the overall asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out employer match (if available) and contribute the maximum amount you're comfortable with.
- **IRA:** For additional tax-advantaged savings, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for additional savings or flexibility, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that fits your financial situation. It's always beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
