The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed. This can lower your taxable income for the year. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional 401(k) can be beneficial.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If youâ€™re maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts but still have additional funds to invest, consider taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure your investment is tailored to your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Typically, longer-term accounts like a 401(k) or IRA can be more heavily invested in stocks, while taxable accounts might favor more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds).

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Be mindful of the tax implications when distributing investments across these accounts. Generally, it's wise to hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and equity investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as your financial situation or goals change.
