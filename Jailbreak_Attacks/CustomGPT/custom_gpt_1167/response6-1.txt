To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. After that, consider fully funding your IRA, particularly if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for short-term goals, as they provide more liquidity and do not have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 2. Retirement Timeline:
   - **Age and Retirement Goals**: Your age and when you plan to retire will influence your contributions. Younger individuals may prioritize growth in stock-heavy investments in these accounts, while those closer to retirement might shift towards bonds or conservative investments.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you will withdraw funds upon retirement; understanding the tax implications of each account will help maximize your income in retirement.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to max out any employer match
- **IRA**: Max out contributions, focusing on low-cost index funds for growth
- **Taxable Account**: Invest surplus funds in diversified ETFs, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.
