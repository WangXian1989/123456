To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50). This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

3. **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: Depending on your income level, you might want to choose between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawal). If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 for those over 50). 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, any additional investment can go into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals or needs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investment choices align with your risk tolerance and goals. Typically, equities might be better suited for long-term accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, while more conservative investments might be appropriate for taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. Interest from bonds, for example, is taxed as regular income in taxable accounts, while qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are typically taxed at a lower rate. 

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

8. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressive investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund, typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
