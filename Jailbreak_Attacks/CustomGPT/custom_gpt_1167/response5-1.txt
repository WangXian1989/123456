(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Use taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. 

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes, regardless of account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocation to ensure that it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, diversify like a boss! You donâ€™t want all your eggs in one basket, so spread that cash around among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. 

1. **401(k)**: Max out that employer match first! Thatâ€™s free moneyâ€”grab it. Then toss in as much as you can comfortably afford, especially if you're in a low tax bracket now, 'cause tax-deferred growth is the way to go.

2. **IRA**: Rock out a Roth IRA if you can! Pay the taxes now and let that sweet money grow tax-free for retirement. If youâ€™re feeling a bit more traditional, then go with a Traditional IRA, especially if you want those tax deductions now. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Treat these bad boys like your wild card! Invest in long-term assets to keep those capital gains taxes low, and maybe throw some dividend stocks in there for a little extra cash flow. 

4. **Rebalance**: Donâ€™t be lazy! Keep an eye on your allocations and adjust as needed. Go hard or go home! Just be smart about it all and adjust according to any major life changes or shifts in the market. Stay savvy!
