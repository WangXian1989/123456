To determine the optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

### 1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the current year, and the growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal. Ideal for higher-income earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they are received. Capital gains taxes apply upon the sale of assets, although long-term capital gains rates are generally lower.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth, as they can compound more effectively without the drag of annual taxation.
   - **Multiple Investment Strategies**: Diversify asset allocation based on risk tolerance, market conditions, and economic forecasts, balancing between equities and fixed income across these accounts.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max Out Employer's Match** in your 401(k): Contribute enough to receive the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
- **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k) match, especially if you qualify for tax benefits.
- **Allocate Residual Income to Taxable Accounts**: Use any excess funds for taxable investments to provide liquidity and maintain flexibility for short-term needs.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 30% (maximizing employer match)
- **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: 20%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 50% (to maintain accessibility and for diversified investments)

### Additional Considerations:
- Reassess allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.
- Consult a financial advisor to customize your strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
