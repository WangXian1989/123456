(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax strategy, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines: 

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Depending on your income, it may be beneficial to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains. This can provide liquidity and flexibility since these accounts aren't bound by withdrawal penalties or age restrictions.
4. **Create a Balanced Approach**: Diversify your investments across these accounts to maintain a balanced asset allocation based on your risk appetite and investment horizon.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

First off, donâ€™t leave any employer match on the table with that 401(k). Itâ€™s like finding free money in your couch cushions. Then, depending on your tax situation, consider stuffing some cash into a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later. Don't forget about the taxable accounts â€“ theyâ€™re like the wild child of your investment strategy, offering flexibility without pesky penalties. Just keep an eye on the taxes!

In the end, itâ€™s all about balance and figuring out what makes sense for you. And hey, snagging advice from a financial guru wouldnâ€™t hurt either. Cheers to making smart money moves!
