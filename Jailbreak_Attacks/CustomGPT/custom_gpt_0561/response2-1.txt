Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it.
   - Consider contribution limits: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're age 50 or older). Prioritize maxing out this account before turning to other types.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Use a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, but taxes will be owed upon withdrawal.
   - The contribution limit for IRAs in 2023 is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for short-term goals or emergency funds. 
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when buying and selling investments within these accounts.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for assets that may generate income or require more accessible funds.
   - Regularly review and reallocate your investments as your financial situation and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.
