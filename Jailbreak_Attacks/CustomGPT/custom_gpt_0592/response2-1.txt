To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal, making it beneficial for long-term growth.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, growing tax-deferred. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes on profits. However, they offer flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax efficiency.
   - For shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a house or emergency funds), consider taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k) contributions (plus a $7,500 catch-up for those age 50 and older) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Employer Matches and Benefits**:
   - If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match before allocating funds to your IRA or taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification Strategies**:
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account. A mixture of growth and income-generating assets can balance risk and return.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Maximize your 401(k) contributions to at least the employer match**.
- **If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA** for its tax-free growth potential.
- **Allocate any excess funds** into taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
