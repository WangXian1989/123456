The optimal distribution of your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, time horizon, tax situation, and your current age. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Account:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Since contributions are pre-tax (or Roth contributions after tax), consider maximizing your contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, a Roth can be advantageous.
   - A Traditional IRA can be beneficial for tax deductions on contributions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains (like stocks) to benefit from lower tax rates on those gains.
   - Consider keeping investments that generate high levels of interest income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize contributions to the accounts with tax advantages first (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts.
- Diversify your investments across these accounts to align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your individual circumstances and goals.
