To determine the optimal distribution of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions with taxes on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals), your strategy should align with your expected tax rate at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so strategies to minimize taxes can include holding investments long-term and considering tax-efficient funds.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your retirement goals: longer time frames may allow for a focus on growth through stocks, while shorter time frames might demand safer, income-generating assets.
   - Consider your risk tolerance: a diversified approach may reduce risk.

### Strategies for Distribution:
- **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, then focus on maximizing IRA contributions to benefit from tax advantages.
- **Allocate Cash Flow**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Suggested Distribution Example:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your contributions, targeting max contributions for the match.
- **IRA**: 30%, focusing on maximizing tax-advantaged growth.
- **Taxable Account**: 20% for liquidity and investments that generate capital gains.

### Periodic Review:
- Regularly assess your allocation as income levels, tax laws, and financial goals can change.

Consulting with a financial advisor may further tailor these strategies to your personal situation for optimal results.
