The best allocation of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Choose based on whether you prefer tax savings now or in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts have no contribution limits and offer flexibility for withdrawals. They’re advantageous for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or tax-free municipal bonds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) at least to the match level.
- Next, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- Any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

Consider your projected retirement income and tax situation to fine-tune your distribution strategy, and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice that considers your specific circumstances.
