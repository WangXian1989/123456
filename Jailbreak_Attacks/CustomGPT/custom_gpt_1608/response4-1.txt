Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA:** If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Max Out 401(k):** After taking advantage of the match and depending on your tax situation, contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. These can be good for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing the funds sooner.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Generally, long-term investments might lean toward stocks, while shorter-term funds might be more conservative.

6. **Rebalance Annually:** Review your portfolio annually to ensure it aligns with your goals and rebalance as necessary.
