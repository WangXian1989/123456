Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA, particularly a Roth IRA if you qualify. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can think about taxable accounts. These are more flexible, allowing for withdrawals at any time without penalties, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to hold more growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth, while using taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or long-term bonds).

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and to respond to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of tax implications when withdrawing or selling investments, especially in taxable accounts. 

Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific needs and financial situation.
