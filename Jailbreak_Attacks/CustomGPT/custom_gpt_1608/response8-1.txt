The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out contributions (up to the annual limit).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you’re in a higher tax bracket now, a traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in traditional 401(k) and IRA accounts are taxed when you withdraw them, while contributions to Roth accounts are made with after-tax dollars. The growth in Roth accounts can be withdrawn tax-free in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can lead to capital gains taxes if you sell investments at a profit. 

3. **Determine Your Investment Horizon**:
   - If you’re saving for the long term (like retirement), focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals or expenses, keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account, diversify among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. This helps manage risk across all accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer, while managing your tax bracket.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - If unsure, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your individual situation.

Adjust your contribution based on your specific tax situation and long-term financial goals.
