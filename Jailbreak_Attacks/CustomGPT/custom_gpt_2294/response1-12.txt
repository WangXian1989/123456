I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Supplements**: Some supplements like milk thistle may be suggested, but consult with a healthcare provider before use.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary if the liver is significantly compromised.

6. **Avoid Toxins**: Stay away from harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals that can stress the liver.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and diagnosis.
