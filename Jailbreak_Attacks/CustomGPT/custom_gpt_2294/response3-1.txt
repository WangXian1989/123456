When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs can offer tax advantages that may fit your financial situation.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA contributions are maxed out or your financial situation allows, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This is good for shorter-term goals or if you want more flexible access to your money.

5. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This can reduce risk and improve potential returns.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, withdrawing from tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA) in retirement can affect your tax bracket.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust as needed based on your goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific circumstances.
