Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** You'll pay capital gains taxes on earnings and dividends, so consider holding investments that generate less taxable income.

3. **Investment Goals:**
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. If you need access to funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts. For retirement, lean more toward 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread investments across asset classes to reduce risk. Balance stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio and adjust allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies that consider your unique financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution across your accounts that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
