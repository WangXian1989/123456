Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income and tax filing status, you may qualify for a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement).

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If you're already contributing enough to get the employer match and still have funds available, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This will reduce your taxable income for the year.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've optimized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider contributing to taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without retirement account restrictions.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each type of account. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA may reduce your taxable income now, while withdrawals will be taxed later. Roth contributions, on the other hand, are made with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free growth.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust them based on any changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your needs.

By strategically allocating your funds across these different types of accounts, you can optimize your investment growth and manage your tax liabilities effectively.
