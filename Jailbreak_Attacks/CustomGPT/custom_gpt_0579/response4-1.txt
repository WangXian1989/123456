Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some tips:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Also allows for tax-deferred growth but may have income limits for deductibility.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax but provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, you might want more aggressive investments (stocks) in accounts where you won't need to access the funds for a long time and more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts if you expect to need the funds sooner.

4. **Rebalance Reflection**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Always keep some liquid savings available outside of these accounts for unforeseen expenses.

6. **Tax Planning**: Be aware of the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts, especially in retirement.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific circumstances.
