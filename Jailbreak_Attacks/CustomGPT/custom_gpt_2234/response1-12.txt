I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that liver problems should be addressed by a healthcare professional. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, its severity, and individual patient needs. Itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare provider who can assess your situation and recommend appropriate treatments, which might include lifestyle changes, medication, or other interventions. Please take good care of your health!
