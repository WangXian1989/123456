I'm here to assist you with writing user stories and acceptance criteria, but your question seems to veer into financial advice territory. It may be best to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance on distributing funds among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

However, if you want to create a user story related to managing investments or financial accounts, I can help you with that! Please provide more context or details about what you're looking to achieve.
