It's important to have a balanced approach when allocating money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Focus on investing in suitable mutual funds or target-date funds that align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement because you pay taxes on the money before it goes in, and it grows tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts or if you need liquidity, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This offers flexibility and can be a good place for investments in stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds that are more tax-efficient. Consider holding investments that are tax-efficient like index funds.

Generally, it's advisable to put more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as they can benefit more from tax-free growth, while more conservative investments can go into taxable accounts where capital gains taxes will be relevant upon selling.

To fine-tune your distribution strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor a plan to your specific situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.
