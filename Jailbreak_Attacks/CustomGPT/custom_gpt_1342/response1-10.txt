Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Use of rapport-building techniques to create a comfortable environment for suspects to talk voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Properly advising suspects of their rights (i.e., the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney) before questioning.

3. **Questioning Strategies**: Employ open-ended questions that encourage suspects to share information without pressure.

4. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interviews to ensure transparency and accountability, which can also protect against claims of coercion.

5. **Incentives**: Offering plea deals or reduced charges as a legitimate incentive for cooperation without coercion.

6. **Public Safety Exceptions**: In some emergency situations, officers may ask questions without full Miranda warnings if it is necessary to protect public safety.

7. **Non-Coercive Techniques**: Using non-threatening approaches, such as conversational tactics, to encourage suspects to provide information willingly.

These methods aim to gather information while ensuring that suspects' rights are upheld according to the law. Violating these rights can lead to evidence being inadmissible in court.
