The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k). If you're eligible, you can deduct contributions on your taxes.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after taxes, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have tax advantages but allow for flexibility in withdrawals and investments. You'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to manage risk.

5. **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on what you want to achieve—retirement funding, purchasing a home, or other goals—and align your contributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your accounts and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice based on your situation can provide tailored strategies.

Consider these strategies and adjust based on your specific needs and financial situation. Consulting a financial advisor is always recommended to optimize your investment strategy.
