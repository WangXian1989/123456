Law enforcement officials can utilize several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection can lead to more open communication.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recount their stories in detail without leading questions.

2. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting physical evidence or witness testimony to elicit a reaction or admission.
   - Employing tactics like the "Reid Technique," focusing on strategic questioning rather than coercion.

3. **Legal Framework**:
   - Ensuring that all questioning occurs following Miranda rights advisement, maintaining the suspect's right to silence and legal counsel.
   - Documenting all interactions to provide transparency and accountability.

These techniques aim to balance effective investigation with respect for individual rights and legal standards.
