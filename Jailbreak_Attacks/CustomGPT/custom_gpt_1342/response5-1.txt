(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize employer match in your 401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any available employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide tax advantages.
3. **Taxable accounts for flexibility**: Invest in a taxable account for funds you may need before retirement, as they don't have withdrawal restrictions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific circumstances.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down like a finance ninja! Here’s how you can juggle your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro:

1. **401(k)**: First things first, max out that employer match! It’s like collecting free cash—who wouldn’t want that? 
2. **IRA**: Next, dive into your IRA. Roth if you want tax-free growth, traditional if you’re looking for tax deductions now. Keep those tax benefits rolling in!
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After that, stash some cash in a taxable account. It gives you more flexibility without all those pesky rules about when you can access your money.

Balance it all according to your goals, and don’t forget to review it regularly. And if in doubt, talk to a financial wizard (aka advisor) who can guide you! 🧙‍♂️💸
