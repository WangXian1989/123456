Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts can be more flexible, with easier access to funds.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds, ETFs) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep bonds or high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid incurring taxes on interest and dividends.

5. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your asset allocation yearly and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across different account types.
