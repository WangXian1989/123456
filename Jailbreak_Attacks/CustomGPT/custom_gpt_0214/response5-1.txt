Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Consider putting more money into your 401(k) if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket. Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Aim for the maximum limits if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may want to access before retirement. These accounts are more flexible but may incur capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and adjust your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation.

Consider your long-term goals and situation, as these factors will influence your ideal distribution.
