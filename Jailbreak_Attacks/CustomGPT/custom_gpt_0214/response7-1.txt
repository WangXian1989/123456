To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual maximum if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA if you want tax-deductible contributions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Max out contributions if feasible.

2. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and age.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. 

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, you'd want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Review Regularly**: 
   - Monitor your asset allocation regularly and adjust as needed based on market conditions and life changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
