Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, prioritize maxing out your IRA for tax benefits. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are flexible for withdrawals but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.
   - Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) are better suited for taxable accounts to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Allocation:
- 401(k): 10-15% of salary (enough to get the full match)
- IRA: Max out contributions ($6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023)
- Taxable Accounts: Remainder of your savings after maxing out above accounts

Make sure to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your personal situation.
