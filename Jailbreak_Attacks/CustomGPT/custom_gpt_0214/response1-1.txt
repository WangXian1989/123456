Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially "free money."

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve optimized tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account for additional flexibility. This account can be useful for short-term goals, as it allows easier access to funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Keep a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider asset allocation based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
