Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to capture that full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now but will be taxed at your ordinary income rate when withdrawn in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, prioritize Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider this account for investments that you plan to hold long-term to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts, focusing on different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and considering the tax implications of each.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before heavily investing in retirement accounts. This typically includes three to six months of living expenses in an accessible account.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**
   - Evaluate your risk tolerance and select an asset allocation strategy (e.g., aggressive, moderate, conservative) that aligns with your retirement timeline and goals.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies in Retirement**
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement. Some strategies suggest taking from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred growth of your retirement accounts to continue.

### 7. **Review Regularly**
   - Revisit your investment strategy periodically to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then allocate a percentage based on your overall investment strategy.
- **IRA**: Consider maximizing contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investing beyond retirement accounts, focusing on long-term growth to take advantage of capital gains.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances and goals.
