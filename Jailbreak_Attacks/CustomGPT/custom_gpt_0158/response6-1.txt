Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Contributions:** Decide whether to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
  
### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your IRA (traditional or Roth) each year, as these accounts grow tax-deferred.
   - **Tax Strategy:** Use traditional IRAs for tax deduction benefits if you're in a higher tax bracket now and Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **For Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for savings you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
  
### General Allocation Tips:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the asset allocation based on your risk tolerance in each account, keeping riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and adjust your distribution strategy based on performance and life changes.

### Final Considerations:
- **Seek Professional Advice:** Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep updated on contribution limits and tax laws, as these can change annually.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to enhance your retirement savings while managing tax implications.
