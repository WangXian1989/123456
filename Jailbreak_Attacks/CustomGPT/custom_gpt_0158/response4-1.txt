When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, focus on your IRA contributions. For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 to a traditional or Roth IRA ($7,500 if you're 50 or older). These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more quickly.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you're not maxing out your 401(k), consider increasing your contributions after fully funding your IRA. The contribution limit for a 401(k) is significantly higher than for IRAs, allowing you to save more for retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Consider your current tax bracket and project your future tax situation. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial as it allows for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be more advantageous.

6. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are properly diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. You can hold different types of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to balance risk and return.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure or your situation is complex, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your goals.

Ultimately, the best strategy varies based on your individual financial situation and objectives. Always be sure to keep updated on the contribution limits and regulations that may affect your accounts.
