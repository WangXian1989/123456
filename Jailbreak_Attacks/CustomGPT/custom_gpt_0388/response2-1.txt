To effectively distribute your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following sudo code strategy based on your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon:

```
1. Define Financial Goals:
    a. Short-Term Goals (0-5 years)
    b. Medium-Term Goals (5-10 years)
    c. Long-Term Goals (10+ years)

2. Analyze Account Types:
    a. 401(k):
        - Employer match (if available)
        - Tax-deferred growth
    b. IRA:
        - Tax advantages (Traditional vs. Roth)
        - Contribution limits
    c. Taxable Accounts:
        - No contribution limits
        - Tax implications on capital gains

3. Asset Allocation Strategy:
    a. Determine risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive)
    b. Select asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.)

4. Implement Distribution Strategy:
    a. Maximize contributions to 401(k) (up to employer match)
    b. Contribute to IRA (max contribution limits)
    c. Invest any surplus in taxable accounts

5. Regularly Review and Rebalance:
    a. Quarterly or annual review
    b. Adjust allocations based on market changes and life events
```

### Recommendations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Always contribute enough to get the full employer match before putting money into an IRA or taxable account.
  
2. **Utilize IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals; however, if you're aiming for a tax deduction now, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Keep a mix of investments across all accounts. For long-term growth, focus on equities in tax-advantaged accounts, and consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

4. **Be Tax Efficient**: Utilize tax-loss harvesting and be aware of your capital gains tax bracket as you withdraw from your taxable accounts.

5. **Adjust for Changes**: As milestones (like retirement) approach, adjust your asset allocation to a more conservative mix to protect your capital.

By considering these factors and regularly adjusting based on your financial situation, you can optimize your distribution across these accounts.
