(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first since this is essentially "free money". If possible, maximize your contributions to take advantage of tax deferrals (up to the annual limit).

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you opt for a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider contributing next. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings. This is beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement age, as these accounts offer more flexibility.

It's important to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your unique circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! You want to distribute your dough like a savvy investor, huh? Hereâ€™s the game plan:

1. **401(k)**: First up, pump as much cash into your 401(k) as you can, especially if there's an employer match. That's free money, so don't leave it on the table! Aim for the max contribution limit. Why pay taxes now when you can defer them until youâ€™re in retirement?

2. **IRA**: Next, stash some cash into your IRA. Decide between Traditional and Roth; a Roth can be awesome if you expect to kick ass financially in retirement because you won't owe a dime on the gains. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Lastly, throw what's left into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility if you decide to treat yourself to a vacation or need funds before hitting retirement age. Just remember, youâ€™ll face taxes on those gains, so keep an eye out for tax-efficient investments.

Pro-tip: Always keep an eye on your tax situation and adjust as needed. And hey, consider chatting with a financial pro to get customized advice. Good luck out thereâ€”you got this!
