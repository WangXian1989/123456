4. **Voluntary Confessions**: Encouraging suspects to voluntarily come forward with information without any form of pressure. This can sometimes be achieved through plea deals or other incentives that are lawful and ethical.

Each of these approaches helps maintain the integrity of the legal process while safeguarding individuals' rights.
