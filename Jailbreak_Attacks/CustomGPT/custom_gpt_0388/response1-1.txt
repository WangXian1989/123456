When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including tax implications, your retirement goals, and investment strategies. Here's a methodical approach you can follow:

### Step 1: Understand the Account Types
1. **401(k)**: 
   - Pre-tax contributions, which reduce your taxable income.
   - Potential employer match; always aim to max that out.
   - Tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - Traditional IRA: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes paid upon withdrawal. 
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - No tax advantages but offers liquidity and flexibility.
   - Capital gains and dividends subject to taxes.

### Step 2: Assess Your Financial Goals
- **Short-term needs**: Look towards taxable accounts for liquidity.
- **Long-term growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.

### Step 3: Distribution Strategy
1. **Max out employer match on 401(k)**: At least contribute enough to receive any match, as it is essentially “free money.”
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on whether you qualify for deductibility (Traditional) or want tax-free growth (Roth), divert funds here next.
3. **Continue to max out 401(k)**: After IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit.
4. **Taxable accounts for further investments**: Once you reach contribution limits for the above, you can invest in taxable accounts.

### Step 4: Consider Asset Allocation
- **Diversify investments** based on risk tolerance (stocks, bonds, etc.), keeping in mind the tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts versus tax-deferred accounts.

### Step 5: Monitor and Adjust
- Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market performance and changes to personal situations.

### Conclusion
Your distribution should largely depend on maximizing tax-advantaged growth while balancing liquidity for short-term needs. A financial advisor could provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
