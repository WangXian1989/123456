I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest general treatment options typically considered for liver problems. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional to get advice tailored to your specific condition. Here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Diet**: Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; limit fatty and sugary foods.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Avoid or significantly reduce alcohol intake to prevent further liver damage.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: If the liver issue is viral hepatitis, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Nutritional Supplements**: Certain vitamins and supplements might support liver health, such as vitamin E and milk thistle.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with liver function tests to monitor the condition of your liver.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, treatments might involve procedures like a liver biopsy or even a liver transplant.

6. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: If other medical conditions contribute to liver problems, managing those can help improve liver function.

Remember, always consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
