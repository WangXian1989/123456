Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest that treatment options for liver problems typically include lifestyle changes, medications, and, in more severe cases, surgery. Here are some general suggestions:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, and limit alcohol consumption.
   - **Exercise**: Engage in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the specific liver issue (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and any progression of the condition.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In advanced cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
