Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if possible, as these are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, making them beneficial for long-term growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to manage risk and optimize growth. Maintain a balance that aligns with your risk tolerance.

4. **Liquid Reserves**:
   - Keep some money in your taxable accounts for liquidity. This can be useful for emergencies or short-term goals.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation and adjust for any life changes or market conditions.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If retirement is many years away, focus on growth in tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, prioritize stable investments and income generation.
