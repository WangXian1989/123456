To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce taxable income; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) (traditional IRA); Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes apply annually on dividends and interest, and on capital gains when selling assets.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if possible, as these accounts provide tax advantages.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to your employer's plan options. Choose diversified funds with low fees.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility in investment choices. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and index funds based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies before investing significantly in these accounts.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investments with your goals. Longer-term investments can be more aggressive; shorter-term may require more stability.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to reduce risk.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Maximize IRA contributions next.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investment flexibility or shorter-term goals.

### Example Distribution:
- 401(k): 40%
- IRA: 30%
- Taxable: 30%

### Next Steps:
- Monitor your asset allocation regularly and adjust based on life changes or market conditions. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
