Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider factors like tax implications, your investment goals, and your timeline. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for long-term savings.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good for tax diversification.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. Choose based on your tax situation.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in accounts with long-term growth potential (like a 401(k) or IRA).
   - Use more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Future Considerations**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - Balance short-term and long-term goals—taxable accounts provide more liquidity.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on performance and life changes.

### Recommended Steps:
- **Start with 401(k)**: Max out to employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Decide between Traditional or Roth based on tax strategy.
- **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After your retirement accounts are funded.

This approach provides a mix of tax advantages, liquidity, and growth potential.
