To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Prioritize Contributions
- **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
- **IRA:** Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth, based on your tax situation).
- **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for additional investments.

### 2. Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth investments (stocks, ETFs) due to potential tax advantages. Consider a diversified mix based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Prioritize lower-turnover investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. Tax Efficiency
- **Place Bonds in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Since bond interest is taxed as ordinary income, it's often beneficial to hold them in your 401(k) or IRA.
- **Hold Stocks in Taxable Accounts:** Long-term capital gains from stocks are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, making them better suited for taxable accounts.

### 4. Regular Review and Rebalance
- Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
1. **Maximize employer contributions first, then IRA.**
2. **Consider tax implications when choosing account types for investments.**

### Next Steps
- Analyze your current investment strategy.
- Decide on your risk tolerance for a tailored asset allocation.
