Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**

- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first—this is free money (+).
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages (+).
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility (+).

### 2. **Tax Considerations**

- **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing current taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income later.
- **IRA**: Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement; Traditional IRA has tax-deferred growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, but you have flexibility in withdrawals and investments (+).

### 3. **Investment Strategy**

- **401(k)**: Focus on diversified funds (e.g., target-date funds) that align with your retirement date.
- **IRA**: Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs based on your risk tolerance.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (index funds, tax-managed funds) to minimize tax impact (-).

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**

- Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your risk profile and investment goals (+).

### 5. **Consider Time Horizon**

- If retirement is many years away, you can afford a more aggressive investment strategy. As retirement approaches, shift towards safer investments (-).

### Conclusion

Using this strategy can help you effectively allocate your resources across different accounts, maximizing growth and minimizing taxes.
