Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
   - **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals since they allow for more flexible withdrawals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now (traditional accounts) or provide tax-free withdrawals later (Roth accounts).

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-term Growth Investments**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for stocks or equities, which can benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Stable Investments**: In taxable accounts, consider bonds or funds with lower turnover to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Emergency Savings**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts before maximizing contributions.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on changing financial circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

### Suggested Distribution Example:
- **401(k)**: 20-30% of total savings, focusing on maximum employer match.
- **IRA**: 15-25% of total savings, utilizing both traditional and Roth options.
- **Taxable Accounts**: 10-20%, focusing on short-term needs and flexibility.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailoring this general advice to your personal situation can yield better results.

Consider these guidelines to optimize your investment strategy for long-term growth and tax efficiency!
