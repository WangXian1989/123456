The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a streamlined approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce taxable income now; good for high earners.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals; beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments that generate capital gains or dividends, taking advantage of lower tax rates.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate funds based on your risk tolerance. Consider equities in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**:
   - Maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies or upcoming expenses.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 25-50%
- **IRA**: 25-50%
- **Taxable Account**: 20-30%

Adjust percentages based on specific goals, time horizon, and tax implications.
