Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Roth or traditional IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Suitable for higher earners expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Ideal for those anticipating a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Evaluate Investment Strategies**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers limited investment options; focus on low-cost index funds.
   - **IRA**: Greater flexibility; consider a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower capital gains tax implications (like index funds) and maintain flexibility for withdrawals.

### 4. **Balance for Liquidity Needs**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies before over-investing in retirement accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for goals within 5 years.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Assess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### Example Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match (e.g., $19,500 if under 50).
2. **IRA**: Max out contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50).
3. **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on personal financial goals and consult a financial advisor for a personalized plan.
