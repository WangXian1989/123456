To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; grows tax-deferred.
   - **IRA**: Individual contributions; can be traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free on withdrawal).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains; more flexible but has tax implications.

### 2. **Strategic Distribution**:
   - **Max out 401(k) Contributions**: Take advantage of employer match; aim for annual limits.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax benefits or Roth for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in stocks, bonds, or ETFs that may have favorable tax treatments (like holding for over a year for long-term capital gains).

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**:
   - **Hold High-Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize compounding by placing stocks and high-growth assets in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Place Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds, REITs, or dividend-paying stocks here to manage tax impacts.

### 4. **Yearly Review and Adjustments**:
   - Regularly review your investment strategy to adapt to changing financial goals and market conditions.
   - Explore tax-loss harvesting strategies in taxable accounts to offset capital gains.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide guidance tailored to your financial situation and help optimize your investment strategy.

By employing these strategies, you can effectively balance growth potential with tax efficiency.
