Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Stay within annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2023, with an additional catch-up of $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Diversify Tax Treatment**: Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limit ($6,500 for 2023, plus $1,000 catch-up if over 50).
   - **Eligibility**: Ensure you meet income eligibility requirements for contributing to a Roth IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, making them ideal for shorter-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liability.

### General Strategy:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - Fund your 401(k) up to the match first, followed by an IRA, and then your taxable account.
2. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
3. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on life changes and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Diversification and tax efficiency are key. Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
