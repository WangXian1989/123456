When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Match**
   - **Max out your 401(k) to at least the employer match:** This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.
   - **Contribute enough to maximize this benefit before moving to other accounts.**

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
     - **Traditional accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Contributions are tax-deferred, so they lower your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
     - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement.

### 3. **Balance Investment Types**
   - **Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts:** Growth stocks and funds—which may generate higher capital gains—can be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Utilize taxable accounts for income-generating investments:** This includes bonds or dividend-paying stocks, where dividends are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. **Reassess Periodically**
   - **Review and rebalance:** Monitor and adjust your distribution based on performance, changes in tax laws, or shifts in your financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
   - **401(k):** 50% of your total contributions, focusing on maximizing employer match.
   - **IRA (Roth):** 30% of contributions, benefiting from tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Account:** 20% for flexibility and accessing funds as needed.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your investment strategy according to your financial situation and retirement goals can enhance your long-term growth while efficiently managing tax implications.
