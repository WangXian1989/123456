I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment options typically depend on the specific condition (like fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and support liver function.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: If hepatitis is the issue, medications can help manage the viral infection.
   - **Liver Support Supplements**: Some supplements may support liver health, but consult with a healthcare provider first.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging can track liver health and progression of the disease.

Consulting a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations is essential.
