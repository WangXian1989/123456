Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) next if you haven't reached the annual limit, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, consider opening or contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This can provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices, though you will incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments can be placed in accounts that benefit from tax-free growth (like IRAs and 401(k)s), while lower-risk investments can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications. Higher-yield investments (bonds, REITs) may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocations annually or when your financial situation changes to ensure you are on track with your goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
