Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can provide tax deductions (for traditional accounts) or tax-free growth (for Roth accounts).

   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if there's a company match.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider funding an IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer more liquidity and flexibility since there are no restrictions on withdrawals, but be aware of capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:

   - Withdrawals from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Gains in a taxable account are subject to capital gains tax, which can vary based on how long you've held the investments.
   - Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classesâ€”stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments. This can help mitigate risk.

6. **Evaluate Your Retirement Needs**: Your distribution strategy should align with your retirement needs. Consider factors like your expected lifestyle, healthcare costs, and how long you expect to be in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your financial situation and goals.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across these accounts.
