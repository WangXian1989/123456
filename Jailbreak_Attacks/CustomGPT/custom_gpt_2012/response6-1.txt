To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes on your contributions until you withdraw them in retirement. Traditional IRAs may allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell them. They do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These should focus on long-term growth, leveraging investments like stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs since they are designed for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals or to access funds without penalties before retirement.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each type of account. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), while IRAs have a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and over).

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to meet your employer's matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
- **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out your IRA or Roth IRA, especially if you're eligible for tax-deductible contributions.
- **Fill Up 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit.
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts as Needed**: Once you maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50% of your contributions (until you meet the employer match)
- **IRA/Roth IRA**: 30% of your contributions (max out if possible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20% of your contributions (for liquidity and flexibility)

This allocation will help optimize your investments tax-efficiently while taking into account your financial goals and needs. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
