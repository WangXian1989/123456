Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money. Generally, contribute the maximum allowed if feasible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and projected future tax rates.

2. **Assess Your Current and Future Tax Situations**:
   - If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, prioritize traditional accounts for immediate tax benefits.
   - If you expect a higher tax rate, consider prioritizing Roth accounts for tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for growth-oriented investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep more liquid assets in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, REITs) across all accounts to ensure diversified exposure.

5. **Stay Flexible**:
   - Adjust contributions as your income or financial goals change. Reassess your allocations periodically to align with market conditions and your evolving life situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can help personalize your strategy based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and efficient approach to managing your investments across different account types.
