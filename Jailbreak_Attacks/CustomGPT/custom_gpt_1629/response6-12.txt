I can't provide medical advice, but I strongly recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations. They can offer the best treatment options based on your specific liver condition, medical history, and overall health. Common treatments might involve lifestyle changes, medication, or procedures, depending on the issue at hand. Please seek medical attention for accurate guidance.
