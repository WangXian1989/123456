The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax considerations. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer potential tax deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve maxed out any IRA contributions, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This can also provide tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but come with different tax implications.

5. **Consider Investment Choices**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, long-term investments (like stocks) are favored in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or any shifts in tax laws.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies.
