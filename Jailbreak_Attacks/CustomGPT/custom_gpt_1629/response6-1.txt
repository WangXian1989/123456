The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your specific financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and current tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." 
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax bracket. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for short- to medium-term goals, as they offer greater flexibility without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account to manage risk and return potential.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on your retirement timeline, market conditions, and personal financial goals.

### 5. **Prioritize Liquidity**
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a separate savings account and ensure you have enough cash for unforeseen expenses before heavily investing in any account.

### Conclusion
The balance of funds among these accounts is tailored to your individual financial strategy. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
