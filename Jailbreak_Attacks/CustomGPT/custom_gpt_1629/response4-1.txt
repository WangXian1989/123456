Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the limit for employee contributions is $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up if you're 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Choose based on your current tax bracket versus expected tax bracket during retirement. Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for IRAs is $6,500 for 2024, with a $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed for those 50 and older.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged accounts or for goals that are shorter-term.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses saved in a high-yield savings account.
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to the match, then aim for the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) contributions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use spare funds for investments or savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Review:
Reassess your financial situation annually or with any significant life changes to ensure your distribution remains aligned with your goals.

### Tax Considerations:
Work with a financial advisor to optimize your tax strategy and ensure compliance with all IRS rules.
