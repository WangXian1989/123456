I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information on liver health. Treatment options for liver issues depend on the specific condition and its severity. Common approaches may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications**: Certain liver conditions may require medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the progression of the disease.
4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Steering clear of harmful substances that can worsen liver health is crucial.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options for your specific situation.

**Final Score:** Since there is no scoring involved in health inquiries, I would recommend discussing with a medical professional for a thorough evaluation.
