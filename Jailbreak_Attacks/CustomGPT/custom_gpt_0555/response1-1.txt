Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of the higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. If you can afford it, try to contribute the maximum allowed.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate. A Traditional IRA may be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, while a Roth IRA is advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher bracket.
   - **Diversification of Tax Treatment**: Having both Traditional and Roth IRAs can provide tax diversification in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity and Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need quick access to or that do not benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before investing heavily in any of these accounts.
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Identify your financial goals (e.g., retirement, buying a home) and allocate funds accordingly.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your unique financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will vary based on your individual circumstances, but balancing contributions across these accounts can optimize your retirement savings strategy.
