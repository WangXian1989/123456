When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take several factors into account, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between these depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate during retirement. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a Traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you still have funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts (and especially if you’ve maxed out both your 401(k) and IRA), you can place funds in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility in accessing your money without penalties.

4. **Investment Strategies**: 
   - Within your 401(k) and IRA, consider using tax-advantaged investments, such as growth stocks or index funds, to defer taxes until you're withdrawing in retirement.
   - For taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Consider Your Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors generally can afford to take on more risk, potentially allotting more to stocks within their 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth. Older investors approaching retirement might focus on preserving capital.

6. **Annual Limits and Rollovers**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type and consider rolling over funds if you change employers.

It may also be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor to create a strategy tailored specifically to your financial goals and situation. 

**Final Distribution Suggestion**:
1. Maximize 401(k) contributions to get full employer match.
2. Contribute to IRA (traditional or Roth, based on tax situation).
3. Allocate remaining funds into a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility.

**Final Score:** 8/10 - This strategy is generally sound, but individual circumstances can vary greatly.
