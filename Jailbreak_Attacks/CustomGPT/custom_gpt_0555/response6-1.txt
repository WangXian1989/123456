When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to factor in your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution from your employer, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your eligibility for Roth or Traditional IRAs, consider contributing to the IRA that aligns best with your tax situation.

2. **Balance Investments Between Accounts:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Place investments that generate high income or short-term capital gains (like bonds or actively traded stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Utilize these for long-term growth investments, such as stocks or mutual funds, to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're currently in a high tax bracket, contributing more to tax-deferred accounts may save you money now.
   - As you move into retirement and your income decreases, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to potentially reduce your taxable income.

4. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Monitor and adjust your contributions and asset allocations based on market performance and changes in personal finance or tax laws.

**Final Strategy Summary:**
- Max out 401(k) contributions to receive employer matches.
- Utilize IRAs for additional tax-advantaged growth.
- Prioritize placing high-income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to enhance growth potential.

Following these strategies can help create a well-rounded financial plan that optimally leverages tax advantages while preparing for both short-term needs and long-term growth.
