I'm not a medical professional, but if you’re experiencing liver problems, it’s crucial to consult with a healthcare provider. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage specific conditions, or in severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation. Your doctor will provide the best guidance based on your specific condition.
