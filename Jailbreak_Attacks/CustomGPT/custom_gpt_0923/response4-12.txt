I'm not a doctor, but for liver issues, treatment depends on the specific condition. Common options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Dietary adjustments, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or complications.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Procedures**: For more severe issues, procedures like variceal banding or surgery might be necessary.
5. **Liver Transplant**: In cases of severe liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

Itâ€™s essential to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.
