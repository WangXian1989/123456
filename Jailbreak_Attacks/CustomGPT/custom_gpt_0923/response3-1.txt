Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA next. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Contribute to Traditional IRA**: If you still have funds left after maxing out the Roth IRA, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. This can help reduce your taxable income.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After setting aside money in your IRAs, focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k). The tax-deferred growth can significantly benefit your long-term savings.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, use taxable accounts for investments where you may want more flexibility in withdrawals or if you're planning for short- to medium-term goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications on investments in taxable accounts, as you will pay capital gains taxes on realized gains and dividends.

7. **Rebalance Your Portfolio Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
