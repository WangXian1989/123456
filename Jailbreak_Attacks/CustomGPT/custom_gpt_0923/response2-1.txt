Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax deductions.

### 3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**
   - If possible, try to reach the annual contribution limit for your 401(k). This reduces your taxable income and allows for tax-deferred growth.

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized retirement account contributions, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts can be more flexible since you can access the funds without penalties (though you’ll pay capital gains taxes).

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Allocate investments based on tax implications. For instance:
     - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or ETFs) are better kept in taxable accounts.
     - **Interest-generating investments** (like bonds) should go in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

### 6. **Adjust for Your Retirement Timeline**
   - If you're close to retirement, prioritize reducing risk and ensuring liquidity.
   - If you have a longer time horizon, focus on growth-oriented investments in your retirement accounts.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on changes in market conditions, tax laws, and your financial situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your salary, enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out contributions (currently $6,500 per year, or $7,500 if you’re over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings after maxing out retirement accounts.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique circumstances, especially regarding tax optimization and investment choices.
