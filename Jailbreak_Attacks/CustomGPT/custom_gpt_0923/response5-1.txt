(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After securing the match, consider prioritizing your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation) since these accounts can offer tax advantages.

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k):** Continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts Last:** Once youâ€™ve maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts, where you'll have more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:** Balance contributions based on your current and expected future tax brackets to optimize tax efficiency.

1. **Hit That 401(k) Match ASAP!** Your companyâ€™s match is like finding a $20 bill on the sidewalkâ€”snatch that up first. Contribute enough to get the full match, then you're basically winning already.

2. **IRA for the Win!** If you can, pump your money into your IRA next. Whether it's a Roth or Traditional, you want those tax benefits working for you, especially if youâ€™re not playing the tax game just yet.

3. **Back to the 401(k):** After the IRA, throw more cash into your 401(k). The more you stash away, the less you get taxed now. Gold star for you!

4. **Taxable Accounts?** Only tackle those once youâ€™ve maxed out the other options. Theyâ€™re like the wild west of investmentsâ€”cool, but not as tax-smart!

5. **Play the Tax Game:** Keep an eye on your tax bracket. If you think youâ€™ll be earning more later, focus on contributing to those tax-advantaged accounts while you still can. Game on!
