Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves several considerations. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Understanding Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, but contribution limits apply; good for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds, but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings goals, especially if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**:
     - Risk tolerance and investment timeline should guide your asset distribution (stocks vs. bonds).
     - Consider keeping higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter from taxes.

4. **Rebalance and Review Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess your investment allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes on profits.

By balancing contributions and considering the unique benefits of each account type, you can create a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your financial goals.
