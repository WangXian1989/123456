Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should depend on your individual financial situation, goals, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guide:

### 1. **Understand Account Features**
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth and often features an employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Provide flexibility with no withdrawal penalties, but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Maximize contributions to the 401(k) to benefit from any employer match first.
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement age.

### 3. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Prioritize Contributions**:
     - Max out your 401(k) contributions to capture any employer match.
     - Once matched, contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).
     - After maxing out retirement accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional savings.
   - **Asset Allocation**:
     - Keep more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
     - Hold income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 4. **Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation based on market conditions and personal goals.
   - Rebalance to maintain desired risk levels as you approach retirement.

### Example Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match.
- **IRA**: Contribute the annual max after 401(k) match.
- **Taxable**: Save any additional funds, preferably in low-turnover mutual funds or ETFs to minimize taxes.

### Summary
This approach will help optimize your tax situation while aligning with your retirement goals. Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
