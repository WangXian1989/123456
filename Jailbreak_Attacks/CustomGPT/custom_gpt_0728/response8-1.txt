To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Maximize contributions to these accounts before considering taxable accounts. If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may incur frequent capital gains. This allows you to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates compared to ordinary income tax rates.

2. **Investment Selection**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to employer-selected funds, ensure you choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds aligned with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: You have more investment choices, so consider adding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs) that fit your long-term strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds that generate tax-free income.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: The maximum contribution limits are higher than those for IRAs. Prioritize fully funding this account if you can.
   - **IRA**: Take full advantage of the IRA contribution limits, focusing on either a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation.

4. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Consider the time horizon for each account. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth and future needs while keeping more liquid funds in taxable accounts for shorter-term goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically for retirement. Generally, you may want to draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

In conclusion, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for maximum investment growth, but tailor your strategy based on your current financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice can also be beneficial.
