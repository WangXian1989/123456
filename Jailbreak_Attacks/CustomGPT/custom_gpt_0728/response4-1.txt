Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (or $30,500 if you’re 50 or older). Aim to contribute as much as you can afford without straining your budget.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your tax situation better. With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals because contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The limit for both Traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,500 in 2024 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds and actively managed funds in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

4. **General Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance and how long until you need the funds. Younger investors might favor growth-oriented investments, while those nearing retirement may prefer more conservative options.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified asset allocation across all accounts to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your target asset mix, especially after significant market movements.

**Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific financial situation, consulting with a professional can help you optimize your strategy. 

Ultimately, the right distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, so take the time to assess your goals and options.
