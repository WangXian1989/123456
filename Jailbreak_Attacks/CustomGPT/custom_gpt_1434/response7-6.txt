3. **Encourage Participation**: Organize events or initiatives that promote civic engagement, like voter registration drives and discussions on relevant topics. Make voting accessible and fun.

4. **Influencer Partnerships**: Collaborate with influencers who can authentically connect with young audiences and amplify your message.
