To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and traditional IRA. These accounts provide tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth Accounts**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid and easily accessible account.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Taxable Investments**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce lower taxable income, like index funds, to minimize tax liability.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth and avoid reacting to short-term market fluctuations.
