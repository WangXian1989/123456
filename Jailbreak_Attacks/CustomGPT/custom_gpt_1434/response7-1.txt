To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts offer tax benefits. Aim to maximize employer matches in your 401(k).
   - **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in taxable accounts for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 2. Contribution Limits
   - **Follow Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50+), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. Asset Allocation
   - **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. High-growth assets (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-growth investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts.

### 4. Withdrawals Strategy
   - **Plan Withdrawals**: Consider how and when you will withdraw from each account to minimize tax liabilities, especially in retirement.

### 5. Review Regularly
   - **Reassess Your Strategy**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and tax laws.

Consulting a financial advisor may provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
