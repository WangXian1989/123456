I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests are crucial for tracking liver function.

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always talk to your healthcare provider for the best course of action for your specific situation.
