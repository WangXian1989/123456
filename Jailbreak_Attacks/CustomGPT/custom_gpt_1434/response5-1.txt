Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fill up your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA) because it offers tax-free growth. Consider traditional IRAs if youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or that you anticipate selling in the near term.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced allocation between stocks, bonds, and other assets, regardless of account type.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Different accounts are taxed differently. Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and the implications of withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Adjust Over Time**: Rebalance your portfolio regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial objectives as you approach retirement.

It's always wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
