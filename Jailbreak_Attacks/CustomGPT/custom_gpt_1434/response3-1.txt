Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially "free money"). Aim for the max contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Preferably do this after maximizing your 401(k) match.

### 2. Assess Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest money left after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts have different tax treatments on capital gains and dividends, so choose investments wisely to minimize tax liability.

### 3. Consider Investment Options
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

### 4. Maintain Liquidity Needs
   - Keep enough funds in your taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies, as these can be accessed without penalties.

### 5. Regularly Reassess
   - Review your asset allocation and financial goals annually or when significant life changes occur.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
