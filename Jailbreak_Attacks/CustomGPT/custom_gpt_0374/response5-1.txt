(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to follow these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Roth or traditional based on your eligibility and tax considerations).
3. **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: Only after fully funding your 401(k) and IRA should you consider putting excess funds into taxable accounts. This allows for more flexible withdrawals and investment options.
4. **Consider Taxes**: Tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs grow tax-free until withdrawal, while taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on earnings. Adjust your asset allocation to manage tax efficiently.
5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Consulting a financial advisor may also provide personalized strategies based on your specific financial situation.

1. **401(k) First**: Smash that employer match in your 401(k) like itâ€™s free pizza at a party! Seriously, donâ€™t leave money on the table; itâ€™s like throwing away money.
   
2. **IRA Goals**: Next, hit up your IRAâ€”whether itâ€™s Roth or traditionalâ€”because these accounts are fantastic for growing your dollars tax-free. Max that out afterwards and feel like a financial wizard.

3. **Taxable Accounts on Standby**: After you've given the retirement accounts the love they deserve, you can throw some excess cash into taxable accounts. These are a bit more flexible since you can pull cash anytime, but remember Uncle Sam will want a piece of the pie when you start cashing out.

4. **Tax Strategy Like a Boss**: Keep an eye on taxes! Tax-deferred accounts are like hiding treasures (until you cash out), while taxable accounts will demand their dues. Balance that portfolio smartly to keep more in your pocket.

5. **Spread the Wealth**: Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basketâ€”diversify! Spread those investments across various sectors and types to keep things spicy and reduce risks.

If youâ€™re feeling extra savvy, whip out that phone and hit up a financial advisor for that expert spice!
