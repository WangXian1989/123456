When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. The current limit (as of 2023) is $22,500, or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA next. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may reduce your taxable income today.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Utilize taxable accounts for additional investments once maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. They offer more flexibility and access to your funds without penalties, allowing for liquidity when needed.

5. **Investment Strategy**: For tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in higher-growth assets (like stocks) for long-term growth, as these accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free. In taxable accounts, prioritize investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from these accounts. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals can be tax-free if done correctly.

7. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all types of accounts to balance risk and optimize returns.

Ultimately, your personal circumstances, investment goals, and tax situation will guide your distribution strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also be helpful for personalized guidance.
