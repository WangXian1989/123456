The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and current tax bracket. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money" that can significantly boost your savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) reduce your taxable income, and you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement. If you are eligible for a Roth 401(k), consider contributing to it for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRA contributions can be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax planning.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility, as you can access your funds without penalties before retirement age. Keep in mind the tax implications of capital gains in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on the accounts:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to grow tax-free.
   - Consider placing more stable, income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they may be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Regularly monitor and reassess your investments and contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in tax laws.

**Example Distribution Strategy**:
- Max out your contributions up to the employer match in your 401(k).
- Contribute the maximum allowable to your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on eligibility).
- After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to a taxable investment account.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor your distribution strategy based on your specific goals and circumstances.
