To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before funding taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)

4. **Diversifying Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Hold investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains, while placing less volatile investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where they may be taxed at lower rates.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies and to navigate tax implications, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

By following these strategies, you can optimize the growth of your investments while minimizing tax liabilities.
