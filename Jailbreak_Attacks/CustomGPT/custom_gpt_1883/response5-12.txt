I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems, which may depend on the underlying condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe antiviral medications, corticosteroids, or other drugs.

3. **Monitoring and Follow-ups**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and disease progression.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver biopsy, removal of tumors, or liver transplantation may be necessary.

Itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific situation.
