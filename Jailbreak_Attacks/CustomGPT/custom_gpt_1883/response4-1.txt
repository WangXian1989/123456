To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k), especially if they offer matching contributions. This is often one of the best investment vehicles due to tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth) after maxing out your 401(k). A Roth IRA can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may yield short-term gains or for funds you'll need sooner than in retirement. This is also a good place for investments in tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to balance risk and return.

5. **Keep an Eye on Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments, particularly in taxable accounts, and consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.
