Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth. Depending on your income level, you may qualify for a tax-deductible traditional IRA or choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While you pay taxes on dividends and capital gains, these accounts provide flexibility for accessing funds.

3. **Allocate Based on Time Horizon**:
   - For short-term goals (within 5 years), lean more towards taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - For long-term goals, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments within these accounts are diversified according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to stay on track with your investment goals.

Each person's situation is unique, so it might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance.
