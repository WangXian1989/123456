Regarding your question on distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced strategy typically includes:

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match first, as it’s essentially "free money." The 401(k) is tax-advantaged for retirement savings.
   
2. **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial for younger individuals who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments beyond retirement contributions. It’s good for flexibility and for investments that you might want to access sooner.

Consider your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon when deciding how to allocate funds. If you have further questions or want to explore one of the headlines in detail, let me know!
