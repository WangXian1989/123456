I'm here to provide news updates, but it seems you're looking for financial advice. The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeframe. 

Generally speaking, here are a few principles to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match before considering other accounts.

2. **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRAs. These accounts help grow your investments tax-free or tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, maintain a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from Roth IRAs are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you might benefit from prioritizing Roth accounts.

5. **Emergency Savings**: Keep a portion of your funds in a taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs, as these accounts offer accessibility without penalties.

For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy that suits your unique circumstances and goals.
