The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowed if you're not already doing so, especially if it offers a match.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA next. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This allows for more flexibility, as you can access your funds without penalties (though you'll pay taxes on gains).

4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Investments in taxable accounts might generate capital gains taxes, while investments in tax-advantaged accounts defer tax obligations. 

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Reassess Regularly:** Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial situation or retirement goals.

It's recommended to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically for your circumstances.
