When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, itâ€™s important to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider your current tax bracket and retirement goals. If your employer offers a Roth 401(k), this could be a good option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **IRA**: Max out your contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect your income (and tax rate) to rise in the future. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have higher turnover and tax implications, like actively managed funds, or when you want access to your money before retirement without penalty. Also, consider using these accounts for investments that produce qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **General Strategy**: Aim for a balanced approach that aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Make sure to also maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you create a personalized strategy that fits your specific financial situation.
