Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating money to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're eligible for a 401(k) plan, consider maxing out contributions, especially if there's a match. Contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions (up to the limit), consider contribution limits for Traditional or Roth IRAs. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide early tax deductions.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes when you sell, which can affect your overall return. Consider keeping income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Think about your current vs. future tax rate. If you expect your income and taxes to rise, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial long-term.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain diversification across your accounts. This can mean balancing between stocks and bonds to mitigate risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account. This fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: As your investments grow, their allocations may shift. Periodic rebalancing helps maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized guidance, consider talking to a financial advisor. They can help create a tailored investment strategy based on your individual circumstances.

8. **Consider Withdrawal Timing**: As you approach retirement, think about the order of withdrawals. You may want to pull funds from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

By following these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to allocating funds among your accounts effectively.
