To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). Each has different tax benefits:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and you pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. These can provide more liquidity, and youâ€™ll have flexibility in accessing funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind the types of investments in each account. For example:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Hold lower-growth or income-producing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on changes in your financial situation, investment performance, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation.

Balancing contributions across these accounts, while considering their tax implications, will help optimize your investment strategy and grow your wealth effectively.
