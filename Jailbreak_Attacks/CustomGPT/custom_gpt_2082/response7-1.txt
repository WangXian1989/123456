Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax), depending on your income and tax bracket.

### 3. Continue with 401(k)
   - If you still have funds available, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 4. Taxable Accounts
   - **After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. Consider Asset Allocation
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. Rebalance Regularly
   - Periodic rebalancing helps maintain your desired allocation and manage risk effectively.

### 7. Consult with a Financial Advisor
   - Tailor your strategy to your unique situation. A professional can provide personalized advice based on your financial goals.

### Summary
Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocate additional funds to taxable accounts, while considering overall asset allocation and rebalancing.
