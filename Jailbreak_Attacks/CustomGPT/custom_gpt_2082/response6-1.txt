Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that might generate high short-term gains (taxed at a higher rate) or for assets that are more tax-efficient.

### 3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - **Equities:** Consider having a higher proportion in taxable accounts for long-term investments (held over a year for capital gains tax benefits).
   - **Bonds and Fixed Income:** These are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to interest income being taxed as ordinary income.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Assess and adjust your allocations regularly based on market changes and personal finance goals. 

### Summary:
- **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.**
- **Evaluate investments based on their potential tax impact.**
- **Rebalance to maintain desired asset allocation.**

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
