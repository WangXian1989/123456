Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) as much as you can, especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket. Consider traditional vs. Roth options based on your expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the requirements.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds if needed before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on changing goals, age, and market conditions.
