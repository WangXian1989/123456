When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored, often has matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account. Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax). Contribution limits might be lower than 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages for contributions. Gains are taxed as capital gains when sold.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching funds, as this is essentially free money.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** Good for high-income earners as you delay taxes until withdrawal, typically in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts (Roth IRA, Roth 401(k)):** Beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for short-term goals or if you have maxed out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Optimize Asset Location:**
   - Place bonds and other income-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.
   - Keep stocks with high growth potential in taxable accounts for favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

### 5. **Overall Allocation Strategy:**
   - Aim for a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. This might mean a heavier allocation in equities for long-term accounts and bonds for more stable accounts.

### 6. **Recommendation Structure:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to max out employer match.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to either a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Account:** After maxing retirement accounts, invest any additional funds here for flexibility and liquidity.

### 7. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocation and adjust based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

### Final Thoughts:
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific financial situation and long-term goals.
