Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it's free money.
   - Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it, as 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA.
   - A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Allocate funds here if you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts.
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse mix of investments across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing circumstances and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance can also be beneficial.
