Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:
     - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
     - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. Max out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts before investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon:
     - **Long-Term Goals** (retirement): Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to maximize growth potential.
     - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a well-balanced portfolio across all accounts. Diversification helps manage risk.

6. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that takes advantage of the benefits offered by each account type.
