To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. Aim to max out your IRA contributions if you are eligible.

3. **Consider Tax Impact**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you may benefit from tax deductions now or tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. Use these accounts for investments that may produce income or for money you might need before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Distribute your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for potential growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments to mitigate tax implications from frequent trading.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, aiming to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can help optimize your specific situation, especially regarding tax implications and investment choices.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
