1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Dietary modifications, such as a balanced diet low in fat and sugar.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can harm the liver.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Treatments for underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes management).

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests.
   - Screening for liver cancer in high-risk individuals.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek a healthcare provider for the appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
