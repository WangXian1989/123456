Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s free money!
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax; ideal for investments you plan to access before retirement.

3. **Investment Horizon**:
   - If you’re investing for retirement (long-term), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.
   - For short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), a taxable account may provide more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Different accounts can hold various asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation and make adjustments based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your needs.
