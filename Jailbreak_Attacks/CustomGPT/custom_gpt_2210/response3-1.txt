The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; this is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k)**: Ideal for tax-deferred growth. Focus on domestic and high-growth investments.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth; consider holding investments expected to appreciate significantly here.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for more liquid, shorter-term investments. Prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax impact.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon for each account type. Generally, higher-risk investments should go in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Withdrawals Planning**
   - Plan your future withdrawals to minimize taxes. For example, defer taxes on retirement accounts until withdrawal age.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach often yields the best results. Tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
