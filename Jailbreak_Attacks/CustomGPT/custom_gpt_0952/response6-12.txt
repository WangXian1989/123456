I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet:** A well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limiting alcohol and processed foods can also help.
   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can improve liver health and reduce fat accumulation.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed. For example, antiviral medications for hepatitis or drugs that manage symptoms of liver disease.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - In some cases, medical procedures like a liver biopsy or imaging tests may be necessary to assess liver damage.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function and address any complications as they arise.

Always seek guidance from a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your condition.
