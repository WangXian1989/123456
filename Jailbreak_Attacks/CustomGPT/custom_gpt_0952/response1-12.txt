I'm not a doctor, but I can give you some general information about liver health. Treatment options depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing alcohol intake, and increasing physical activity can significantly improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, your doctor may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from substances that can harm the liver, including certain medications, alcohol, and harmful chemicals.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
