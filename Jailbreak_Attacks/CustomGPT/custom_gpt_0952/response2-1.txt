To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits. In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older). 

3. **Investment Strategy**: Choose your investments based on the account type. For tax-advantaged accounts, consider growth-oriented investments (like stocks) since you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals later. In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (such as index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location**: Place high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative, income-generating assets in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure that it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Balancing contributions and investment strategies among these accounts ensures long-term growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
