When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to max out your employer-sponsored 401(k) contribution, especially if there's a match, since thatâ€™s essentially free money. Then, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Balance Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. Taxable accounts can offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, while the 401(k) and IRA offer tax-deferred growth. Having a mix helps manage your tax burden in retirement. 

It's also wise to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide a personalized approach.
