Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, make sure to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on the money until withdrawal. Focus on maximizing contributions to these vehicles, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for funds that you may need access to before retirement or for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on time horizon and risk tolerance:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers a limited selection of funds. Aim for a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: You can choose from a broader range of investments. This can include individual stocks, bonds, or ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using this for more aggressive investments, knowing that taxes will apply to any gains.

4. **Emergency Fund and Debt Consideration**: Before heavy investment, ensure you have an emergency fund and are managing high-interest debts, as these can affect your investment strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation can also be beneficial.
