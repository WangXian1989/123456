It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money effectively! Here are some strategies to consider for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match firstâ€”this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you're eligible for a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for more flexible access. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investment income, so consider holding investments long-term and focusing on tax-efficient funds like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**: Place more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to minimize tax on dividends and capital gains. Conversely, consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts where interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

4. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon should influence how you allocate funds. Review your strategy periodically and adjust based on changes in your life circumstances or financial goals.

By taking a strategic approach, you can optimize your investments and potentially grow your wealth more effectively over time.
