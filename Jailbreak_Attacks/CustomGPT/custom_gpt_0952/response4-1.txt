Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after your 401(k), as IRAs often provide more investment options.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now but result in taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made post-tax. Depending on your current tax bracket and expected retirement bracket, you may prioritize contributions here.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Generally, place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow without annual taxation.
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-risk investments that produce regular income to minimize tax implications (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks).

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund separate from these accounts before heavily investing.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a financial professional who can tailor advice specific to your financial situation and goals.

Balancing contributions across these accounts effectively will help you optimize growth and minimize taxes over time.
