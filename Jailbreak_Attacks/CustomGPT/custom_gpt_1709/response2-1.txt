Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions Based on Tax Benefits:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your eligibility, Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are best for funds you might need before retirement or for short-term goals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - More stable investments (like bonds) can be held in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly assess your asset allocation based on market performance and your financial goals. Adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have savings set aside unrelated to your investment accounts for emergencies, typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can tailor a strategy based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Max out any employer match (e.g., 5% of salary).
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowed annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any additional funds for short-term needs or goals.

By focusing on these areas, you can create an efficient distribution strategy that aligns with your retirement goals.
