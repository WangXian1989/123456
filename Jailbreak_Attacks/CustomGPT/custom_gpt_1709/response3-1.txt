Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Action**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - **Action**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. 
   - **Considerations**: Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - **Action**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

### 4. **Assess Taxable Accounts**
   - **Action**: Once you maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - **Action**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Actions**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes (e.g., withdrawing from taxable accounts first).

### Final Thoughts
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this plan to your specific circumstances, including income levels, goals, and tax implications.
