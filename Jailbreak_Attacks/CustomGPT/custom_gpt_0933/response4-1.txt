When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—that’s free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out an IRA (traditional or Roth) after your 401(k). Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Place investments with the highest potential returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, as these can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.
   - Keep fixed-income investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they can generate interest that’s taxed at your ordinary income rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Typically, it’s better to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue to grow.

4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Keep an eye on your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate a higher tax rate during retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund in a liquid account to avoid early withdrawals from retirement accounts, which can incur penalties.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess and rebalance your investments based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your personal circumstances.
