Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, lowering your taxable income for the year.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Prioritize Roth Accounts**
   - If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. It can provide tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to minimize risk.

### 5. **Consider Age and Retirement Goals**
   - Younger investors might lean more towards growth-oriented investments, while those closer to retirement may prefer more stable options.

### General Strategy:
1. Max out the employer match in your 401(k).
2. Contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if eligible).
3. Overflow back to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you anticipate exceeding contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

### Continuous Review
- Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation and goals change.

It's advisable to consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
