Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you can, max out your contribution. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like stocks or mutual funds, ideally those held long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates. Keep more income-generating securities in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

### 3. **Asset Location Strategy:**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.
   - Hold high-growth potential investments in tax-advantaged accounts (such as your 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes on gains.

### 4. **Balance Risk and Liquidity:**
   - Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and access needs. Emergency savings should be separate and easily accessible, while retirement accounts can be more aggressively invested.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts. Market fluctuations can lead to misalignment with your goals. Rebalance as necessary.

### 6. **Long-Term Perspective:**
   - Focus on your long-term retirement strategy rather than short-term market trends. Revisit your distribution strategy periodically (at least annually).

### 7. **Seek Professional Advice:**
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.

These steps can help you optimize your investment strategy, balancing growth potential and tax efficiency.
