Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) after maximizing your 401(k) match. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting money into taxable accounts. This is beneficial for short-term savings or investments that may need to be accessed before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across these accounts. Different accounts can hold various asset types — for instance, keep high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. In a taxable account, consider holding investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends to reduce your tax burden.

6. **Retirement Timeline**: Your age and retirement timeline will also influence how much you should allocate to each account. Younger investors might be more aggressive in their 401(k) and IRA investments, while those nearing retirement might prioritize stability.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your financial situation, and shifts in tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
