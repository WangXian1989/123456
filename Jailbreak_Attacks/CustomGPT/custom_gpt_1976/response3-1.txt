It's important to consider a few factors when distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, such as your financial goals, investment time horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maximizing your IRA contributions, as these accounts often provide tax benefits.

2. **Balance Contributions**: If youâ€™re over the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts or need liquidity for short-term goals, allocate extra funds to taxable accounts. This can help cover unforeseen expenses without penalty.

3. **Tax Considerations**: It's beneficial to hold investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping long-term growth investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for favorable capital gains treatment.

4. **Investment Variety**: Diversify your investments across accounts to balance risk and return. Make sure you're not overly concentrated in one investment or sector.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can also provide tailored strategies based on your individual circumstances.
