Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your retirement goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match – it’s free money! Focus on maximizing this before diverting funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you anticipate being in a higher bracket. Maximize your contributions to take advantage of the tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you want to maintain more flexibility. They’re also suitable for investments that generate little taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

It's often sound to prioritize retirement accounts first for their tax advantages, then branch into taxable accounts as needed. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your situation would provide more personalized guidance.
