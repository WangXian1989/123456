I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for tailored advice based on your specific situation. Generally, treatment options may vary depending on the type and severity of your liver issue. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthier diet, reducing alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medications may also be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying conditions. In some cases, advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplant might be necessary. Please reach out to a healthcare provider for personalized guidance.
