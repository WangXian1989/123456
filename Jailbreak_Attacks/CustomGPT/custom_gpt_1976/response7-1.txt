The most effective way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contributions to a 401(k) and IRA can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions in these accounts first before investing in taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Roth Options**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k). This strategy allows your money to grow tax-free, providing tax advantages in the future.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure youâ€™re diversifying across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk effectively.

5. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Avoid short-term gains as they are taxed at a higher rate.

6. **Stay Flexible**: Review your distribution strategy regularly, especially after major life changes like marriage, having children, or nearing retirement to ensure it aligns with your goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: Lastly, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor a distribution strategy to your unique financial situation.

Adjusting your strategy as your financial situation changes is vital for optimizing your investments.
