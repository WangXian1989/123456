The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. This can provide tax advantages and help you grow your retirement savings.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have high-income years and want to lower your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access before retirement or for additional savings. This can also be suitable for investing in assets that are more tax-efficient (like index funds).

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be aware of the tax implications for withdrawals from each account type and strategize your distributions accordingly.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation.
