Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, prioritize paying that off before allocating more to investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings that are not tied to retirement. They offer flexibility but are taxed on gains. Consider using them for shorter-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes. This can help manage risk.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts may have tax consequences. Plan accordingly for your future tax situation.

7. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Tailor your contributions based on your retirement age, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Review your situation periodically and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
