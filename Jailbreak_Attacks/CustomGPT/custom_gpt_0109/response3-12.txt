1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eating a balanced diet low in saturated fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol Limitation**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.
   - Medications to manage symptoms and complications.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options such as liver transplant may be considered.
