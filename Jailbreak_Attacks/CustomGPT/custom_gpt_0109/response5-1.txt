To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Be mindful of withdrawal tax implications; prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts for short-term needs.
   - Plan your retirement withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor a distribution strategy that fits your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investment growth while managing taxes effectively.
