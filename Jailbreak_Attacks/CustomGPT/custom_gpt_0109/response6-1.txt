To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it maximizes your return on investment.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, otherwise, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.

### 2. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in low-tax investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, as taxes on gains are deferred or potentially tax-free.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced allocation across all accounts to manage risk while pursuing growth.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for distributions based on tax implications; withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
