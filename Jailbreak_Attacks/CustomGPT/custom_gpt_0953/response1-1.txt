When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if there are employer match opportunities in your 401(k). This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free (especially with a Roth IRA).

2. **Consider Tax Impact**: Withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) are taxed as ordinary income, while investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax. For long-term growth, hold investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate frequent income (like bonds) to minimize tax impacts.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Allocate based on your financial goals. For long-term goals, lean heavily on tax-advantaged accounts. For short-term needs, maintain liquidity in taxable accounts.

Balancing these factors can help you optimize your overall tax situation and investment growth. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
