Balancing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. If you have both a Roth and a Traditional IRA, you might choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Generally, higher-growth investments (like stocks) should go into tax-advantaged accounts, while more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts. This helps minimize tax liability since gains in tax-advantaged accounts are not taxed until withdrawal.

3. **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep some money in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergencies. This can provide flexibility without the penalties associated with withdrawing from retirement accounts.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and market conditions change, periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
