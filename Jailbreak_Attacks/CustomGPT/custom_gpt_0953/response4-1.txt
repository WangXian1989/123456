Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Consider maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s before investing in taxable accounts. For 2024, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older).

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** Funds in 401(k) and IRA accounts grow tax-deferred, so they’re generally better for higher-growth investments. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Withdrawal Strategy:** Once you start withdrawing funds in retirement, having a mix of account types allows for strategic withdrawals to manage your tax bracket effectively. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility without penalties, while tax-advantaged accounts might be used more strategically.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** As you approach retirement, it’s important to reassess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that takes into account your unique situation.
