To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out employer match first; it's essentially free money. This account grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions now but are taxed later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you might need to access before retirement, focusing on tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Prioritize retirement accounts for tax benefits. Diversify with stocks for growth.
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more to a taxable account if you plan to access funds within 5-10 years. Keep safer investments like bonds or high-yield savings.

Adjust contributions based on your income, tax bracket, and investment horizons for optimal balance. Regularly review your allocations based on market conditions and personal goals.
