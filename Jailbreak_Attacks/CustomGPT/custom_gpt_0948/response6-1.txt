When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider the tax implications and your overall investment strategy. Here's a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.” Evaluate if you should contribute to a traditional 401(k) for immediate tax benefits or a Roth 401(k) for future tax-free withdrawals.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limits may vary, so check the current limits for the specific tax year.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider using strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

3. **Balance and Diversification:**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Different asset classes may react differently in varying market conditions, so maintain a balanced portfolio.
   - Review and adjust your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market performance.

4. **Consider Time Horizons:**
   - Align investments with your time horizon for each account. Longer-term accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) might be more aggressive, while shorter-term funds in taxable accounts might lean towards more conservative investments.

It's always good practice to consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
