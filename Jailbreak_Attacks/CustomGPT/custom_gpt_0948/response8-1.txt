To create a balanced distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - Focus on maximizing contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). 

2. **Diversify Between Account Types:**
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement savings since these accounts offer tax advantages on contributions and growth.
   - Utilize taxable accounts for more flexible investments and shorter-term financial goals, as you can access these funds without penalties.

3. **Tax Implications:**
   - Be aware of the tax implications when withdrawing funds from different accounts. Traditional accounts (like a traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA) will be taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Consider your current and expected future tax bracket when deciding how much to contribute to each account.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Depending on your age and risk tolerance, allocate more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, where the growth is tax-deferred or tax-free, and use more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities from capital gains.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Periodically review your investment performance and contributions. Adjust your strategy as needed based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

For a personalized approach, it's best to consult a financial advisor who can consider your individual goals and financial circumstances.
