When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your overall financial goals, tax implications, and individual circumstances. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money. If possible, aim to max out your 401(k) contributions.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income, you can contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider this option for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  
2. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, you'll owe taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Any gains realized in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. However, you have more flexibility here for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Consider Time Horizon and Risk:**
   - Funds in tax-advantaged accounts are often set aside for retirement. If you have a longer time horizon, consider more aggressive investments in these accounts.
   - For taxable accounts, consider more conservative investments, especially if you may need access to these funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to balance risk and reward.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly reassess your allocations based on your changing financial situation, investment performance, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure about how to allocate your funds, consider getting personalized advice from a financial planner who can take your entire financial picture into account.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so tailor your strategy to fit your specific needs and circumstances.
