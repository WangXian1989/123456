(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, it's advisable to take advantage of employer matches in your 401(k) first, then max out your IRA contributions since these accounts offer tax advantages. Beyond that, taxable accounts can be used for additional investing once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. A diversified investment strategy considering your risk tolerance is essential. Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor the distribution to your personal circumstances.
