Distributing your money among a 401(k), an IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here is a general approach to consider:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, which may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: This can be either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while withdrawals are taxed. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not offer any tax advantages, but they provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching program, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into your IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

3. **IRA Contribution**: After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA. If you qualify, aim for a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for both short-term and long-term goals and can provide quick access to cash without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when allocating investments across these accounts. Generally, growth-oriented investments (like stocks) may be placed in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be kept in taxable accounts.

6. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals, risk tolerance, and any changes in tax laws.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure about the best approach, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your particular situation.

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's essential to consider your circumstances before making decisions.
