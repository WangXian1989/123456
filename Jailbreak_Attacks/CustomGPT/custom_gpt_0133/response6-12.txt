I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific liver condition. Common approaches for liver issues may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - Adopting a healthy diet, particularly one low in fat and sugar.
   - Limiting alcohol intake to reduce strain on the liver.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis or medications to reduce inflammation.

For a precise diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs, please reach out to a medical professional.
