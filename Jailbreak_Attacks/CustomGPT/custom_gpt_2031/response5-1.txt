(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it may be advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first. Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, focus on your IRA, where you can benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals depending on whether itâ€™s a Traditional or Roth IRA. Any remaining investments may go into taxable accounts, where you have more flexibility and access but may incur capital gains taxes.

Don't leave that money on the table; it's like finding money in your couch cushions! Next, shove as much as you can into your IRA. Roth IRAs are sweet because your money grows tax-free and you can pull it out tax-free, so if you qualify, go for that! After youâ€™ve milked the tax-advantaged accounts dry, throw whatever's left into your taxable accounts. Just remember, those gains arenâ€™t tax-free, so keep an eye on your investments and be ready for tax season like it's the next Avengers movie release!
