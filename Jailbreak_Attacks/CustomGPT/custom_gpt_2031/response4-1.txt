It's essential to consider various factors when determining the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some steps to consider:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income in the year they are made, while distributions from these accounts are taxed as ordinary income. Conversely, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax on any profits when assets are sold.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For example, as of 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k), $6,500 to a traditional or Roth IRA ($7,500 if you're 50 or older), and there are no limits for taxable accounts (but be mindful of capital gains).

3. **Evaluate Your Current and Future Tax Rates**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, focusing on a Roth IRA might be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to decrease, traditional accounts may be beneficial.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts. This can help manage risk while potentially maximizing returns.

5. **Access to Funds**: If you may need access to funds before retirement, consider how each account type allows withdrawals. 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals before age 59Â½ typically incur a penalty, while taxable accounts do not.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Tailor your investment strategy according to the account type. For instance, you may want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to grow your retirement savings, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts to limit capital gains taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to meet with a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored distribution strategy based on your individual financial situation.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on your personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. It's recommended to regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.
