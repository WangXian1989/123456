The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account:
   - 401(k): $20,500 for 2022 ($27,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - IRA: $6,000 for 2022 ($7,000 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits as a 401(k) if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in these for flexibility; there are no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. For accounts with tax advantages, consider holding higher-growth assets like stocks. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liability.

5. **Age and Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments should be, particularly in tax-deferred accounts where you're more likely to withdraw soon.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Financial needs and market conditions change over time, so regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions accordingly.

In summary, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, then consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, followed by maxing out your IRA. Finally, invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and additional growth opportunities. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
