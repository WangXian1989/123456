The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. It’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs (Traditional or Roth) once you’ve secured your 401(k) match. This can help reduce your taxable income or grow your investments tax-free.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are not overly concentrated in one type of investment or asset class. Diversifying across different accounts can be beneficial.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Money in taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains and dividends, so you may want to place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) into tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Money in taxable accounts is easier to access without penalties. If you anticipate needing cash in the near term, keep that in mind.

6. **Long-Term Strategy**: Think about your long-term financial goals; if you plan to retire comfortably, ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your retirement timeline.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your investment allocations and adjust based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a good idea to shape a strategy that’s tailored specifically to your individual circumstances.
