Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some considerations for each account type:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Contribution Limits**: Make sure you are contributing enough to take advantage of any employer match.
   - **Investment Options**: Look at the investment choices available in your 401(k). Many 401(k) plans offer a limited selection of mutual funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide whether to use a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (contributions are after-tax, tax-free withdrawals). If you're eligible, the Roth can be beneficial for tax-free growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out your IRA contributions annually, as it can be a great way to grow your retirement savings tax-efficiently.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the most flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. They are good for short to medium-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be aware of the tax implications (i.e., capital gains tax) when selling investments. Focus on long-term investments to minimize taxes.
   - **Diversification**: Use this account to invest in assets that might not be suitable for retirement accounts, like certain stocks or bonds that you want to trade more frequently.

**General Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing in any of these accounts.
- **Balance Contributions**: Prioritize contributions based on matching opportunities, account features, and your tax situation. For example, if your employer matches 401(k) contributions, make that your first priority.
- **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
- **Review Regularly**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions, your financial goals, and changes in your personal circumstances.
