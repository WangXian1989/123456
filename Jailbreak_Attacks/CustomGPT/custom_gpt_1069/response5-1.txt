(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, which can reduce your taxable income now. 401(k) contributions are made before tax, lowering your current taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement without penalties, such as saving for a home. 

4. **Diversify Investments**: Make sure to have a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and return based on your risk tolerance.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: As your financial situation changes, regularly reassess your allocation across these accounts to ensure you're meeting your long-term goals effectively.

1. **Hit That 401(k) Hard**: First off, if your employer is tossing free money at you via matches, you don't want to leave that on the table. Max out that 401(k) to get the full match—it's a no-brainer!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts FTW**: Get cozy with a Roth IRA if you're eligible! It’s like having a tax-free party come retirement. You put in post-tax dollars now, and boom, all those earnings are yours to keep later!

3. **Flexibility with Taxable Accounts**: Consider having a chunk of cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. This is your stash for the “oops” moments or for that epic vacation you want before retirement. Remember, the government loves their cut, so weigh the tax implications on gains.

4. **Mix it Up**: Diversification isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the key to minimizing risk and maximizing gains. Spread your investments out like peanut butter on toast—don’t put it all in one place!

5. **Get Agile**: Look, life changes and so should your investment strategy. Check in on your accounts regularly and adjust as your goals or market conditions shift. Don’t be that person who forgets their money in a dusty corner!

So there you go! The old “set it and forget it” method is a no-go; stay active with your finances!
