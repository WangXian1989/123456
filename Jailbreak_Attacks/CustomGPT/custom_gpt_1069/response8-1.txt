To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (for Roth 401(k)), helping minimize your current taxable income. Maximize employer matches if available.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, you can choose either type.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don't have tax advantages, but they offer liquidity and flexibility. Favor investments that generate capital gains over income to minimize taxes.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. Generally, long-term investments can be riskier, while short-term needs should be more conservative.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you're over 50) and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for those over 50).

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate assets based on your investment goals. For retirement accounts, consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk level. In taxable accounts, emphasize tax-efficient investments.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how and when you'll withdraw funds from these accounts, considering tax implications. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Continuously monitor and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and tax situations.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-balanced investment strategy across your accounts that aligns with your financial objectives.
