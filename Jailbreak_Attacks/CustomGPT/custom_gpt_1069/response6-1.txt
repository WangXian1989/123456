Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions; it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year, making it a beneficial option for high earners.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Tax-Deferred or Tax-Free Growth**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (which offers tax deferral) or a Roth IRA (which grows tax-free), your choice will affect when you pay taxes on contributions and withdrawals.
   - **Flexible Investment Choices**: IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, potentially allowing for better personalization of your portfolio.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on profits and how dividends are taxed. Invest in tax-efficient funds (such as index funds) to minimize tax burdens.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- **Contribute to IRA**: Next, contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, if you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, invest in a taxable account for liquidity and access to investments.

### **Final Tips**
- **Review Annually**: Reassess your contribution levels and account distributions each year to adapt to changing financial circumstances.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

By balancing contributions across these accounts, you can optimize your investments for growth, tax advantages, and financial flexibility.
