Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Tax-advantaged accounts first:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) (especially if thereâ€™s an employer match) and IRA (traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. These accounts often have higher growth potential due to tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

2. **Emergency fund and liquidity:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or a liquid investment before investing heavily in these accounts. This covers unexpected expenses without dipping into retirement savings.

3. **Debt management:** If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before maxing out contributions to your retirement accounts. This can provide a guaranteed return by saving on interest payments.

4. **Investment strategy:** Diversify your investments within each account type according to your risk tolerance and goals. For example, you might want to have a more aggressive portfolio (stocks, for instance) in your taxable accounts if you're in a lower tax bracket, while keeping a balanced approach in your tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Withdrawals and income considerations:** Plan for how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Consider the tax implications of withdrawals from traditional vs. Roth accounts and remember that taxable accounts have different tax treatments for capital gains and dividends.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Market conditions can change the value of your investments, so adjust as necessary.

7. **Consulting a financial advisor:** Personal circumstances can significantly affect investment strategies. A financial advisor can provide tailored advice that considers your entire financial picture.

Balancing contributions across these accounts effectively will help optimize your tax situation and prepare you for a secure financial future.
