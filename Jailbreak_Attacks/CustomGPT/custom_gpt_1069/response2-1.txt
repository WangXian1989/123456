When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be a good option.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible. These accounts grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial if you expect higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains tax on any earnings. They are useful for shorter-term goals or for money that you may need to access before retirement age without penalties.

3. **Diversification**: Within each type of account, ensure you are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid savings account to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes, while placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved, especially with current tax laws and personal financial circumstances, consulting a financial advisor may be helpful to create a tailored strategy.

This approach will help balance immediate tax benefits with long-term growth, catering to your personal financial goals.
