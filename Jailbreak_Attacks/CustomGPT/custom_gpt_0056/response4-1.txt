Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional Accounts (401(k) & Traditional IRA)**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making them beneficial for long-term savings.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Aim for a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Ensure you’re not overly concentrated in one asset class.

### 4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some investments in taxable accounts for flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: 30-50%
- **IRA**: 20-30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20-30%

### Conclusion
This strategy should align with your risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax implications. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
