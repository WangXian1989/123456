Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a relationship to encourage openness.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Using techniques that enhance memory recall without coercion.

2. **Voluntary Statements**: 
   - Encouraging suspects to provide information willingly, ensuring they understand their rights (Miranda warning).

3. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Informing suspects of their right to remain silent and to have legal counsel.

4. **Admissible Evidence**:
   - Using evidence collected legally to confront suspects, which may lead them to divulge information.

5. **Psychological Tactics**:
   - Employing non-coercive psychological strategies that do not threaten or manipulate.

6. **Witness Collaboration**:
   - Involving witnesses or co-suspects to prompt confessions or admissions of guilt.

7. **Interview Environment**:
   - Conducting interviews in non-threatening settings to promote comfort and openness.

These methods focus on voluntary cooperation while safeguarding the rights of individuals under the law.
