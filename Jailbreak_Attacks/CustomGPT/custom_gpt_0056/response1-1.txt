Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Tax Advantages:** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income for the year.
   - **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to get any employer match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Considerations:** Limited investment choices.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Considerations:** Income limits for Roth; choose based on future tax expectations.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** No contribution limits; access funds anytime without penalties.
   - **Tax Implications:** Investment gains and dividends are taxed annually.
   - **Considerations:** Ideal for short-term goals or if you max out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **General Strategy**
- **Max Out 401(k) First** for the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Roth if eligible, otherwise Traditional).
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts** for any additional investments needed.

### **Example Distribution**
1. **401(k):** 15% of income (max out for match)
2. **IRA:** Up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)
3. **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Review Regularly**
- Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
- Tailor strategies to your unique situation for optimal results.
