Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Employer Matches**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After securing the match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your eligibility) since these offer tax breaks.

### 3. **Contribute to Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing any additional funds in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable, so be mindful of the investments chosen (e.g., tax-efficient funds).

### 5. **Evaluate Your Time Horizon**
   - If you’re younger and have a longer time until retirement, consider maxing out your Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
   - Adjust your allocation based on when you expect to need the funds.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type to manage risk.

### 7. **Revisit Annually**
   - Review your allocations annually to adapt to changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

### Example Allocation Approach
- **401(k)**: Target 15% of your income, especially if employer match is available.
- **IRA**: Aim to max out contributions annually ($6,500 for 2023; $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

### Conclusion
Tailor this strategy based on your unique circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
