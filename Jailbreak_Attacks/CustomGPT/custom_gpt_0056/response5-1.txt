To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth or traditional IRA depending on your tax situation.

### 2. **Diversify Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate lower-taxed income (like qualified dividends) or tax-exempt bonds.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In lower brackets, you might benefit from Roth IRA contributions since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - In higher brackets, traditional IRAs may offer upfront tax deductions.

### 4. **Know Contribution Limits**
   - Keep track of annual contribution limits to maximize each account type.

### 5. **Plan for Withdrawals**
   - Consider the tax implications of withdrawals when you retire. Keeping funds in tax-advantaged accounts longer can help grow your assets more efficiently.

### Example Strategy:
1. **401(k):** Maximize employer match, then contribute up to the IRS limit if possible.
2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Contribute the maximum after meeting your 401(k) goals.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use any remaining funds for investments that offer flexibility and liquidity.

### Regularly Review and Adjust:
Monitor and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### Conclusion
Craft a balanced approach prioritizing tax-advantaged spaces while also considering your investment timeline and risk tolerance.
