I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopting a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to check liver function.
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

Consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
