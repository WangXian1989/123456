The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If you're eligible, also contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides additional tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes when you withdraw funds.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings are taxed annually, so consider using these for long-term investments to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for assets expected to appreciate significantly (like stocks).
   - Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) from 401(k) and traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

### 5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your asset allocation and contribution levels regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Sample Distribution:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Account:** 20%
