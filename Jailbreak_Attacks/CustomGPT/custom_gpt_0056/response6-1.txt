Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; consider maxing it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth is generally better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Diversify Investments Based on Account Type**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Invest in higher-growth assets (stocks) since withdrawals are taxed later.
   - **Roth IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments; qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability from capital gains.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can maximize your income while minimizing tax impact.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Personal Goals**
   - Align your allocation with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial objectives.

### Summary
- Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, diversify investments wisely, and plan for tax-efficient withdrawals. Regularly review and adjust your strategy as needed.
