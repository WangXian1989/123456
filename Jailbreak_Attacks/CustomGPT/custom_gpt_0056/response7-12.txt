I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid alcohol and high-fat foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help improve liver function.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor may prescribe medications.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine liver function tests and imaging studies can help track the progression of liver disease.

4. **Treating Underlying Conditions**: Managing related health issues like diabetes or obesity can significantly benefit liver health.

5. **Avoid Harmful Substances**: Stay away from toxins that can worsen liver health, including certain medications and supplements.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
