To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**

- **401(k):** 
  - Pre-tax contributions, reducing taxable income.
  - Employer matching can boost savings.
  - Limited investment options based on your plan.

- **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
  - **Traditional IRA:** Pre-tax contributions; taxes due upon withdrawal at retirement.
  - **Roth IRA:** Post-tax contributions; tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
  - Flexible investment choices.

- **Taxable Accounts:**
  - No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.
  - Taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Start with your 401(k) until you reach the employer match for immediate returns.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your income, consider a Roth for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.
3. **Back to the 401(k):** Max out contributions to your 401(k) after utilizing IRA benefits.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**

- **401(k):** Use for long-term, growth-focused investments.
- **IRA:** Balance between growth and stability; consider more aggressive investments here.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals or more liquid investments. Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

### 4. **Tax Considerations:**

- Place **high-growth investments** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferral.
- Keep **bonds or high-dividend stocks** in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact, as qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate.

### 5. **Rebalance and Review:**

- Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your risk level and investment strategy.

### Conclusion:

Each individualâ€™s situation varies, so consider your goals, time horizon, and tax implications while crafting your strategy. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
