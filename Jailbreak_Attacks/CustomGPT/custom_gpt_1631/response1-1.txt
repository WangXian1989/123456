Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible now, but withdrawals are taxed later. Roth IRAs are funded with post-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and can be ideal for investments you might want to access before retirement without penalties, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Long-Term Growth**: Consider putting higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax-free growth.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes and sectors, regardless of the account type.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. For example, you might withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts to manage your tax bracket.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in income, retirement plans, and tax laws.
