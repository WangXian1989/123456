Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax Benefits**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, focusing more on your 401(k) can be beneficial since contributions are pre-tax.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current tax rate vs. your expected rate in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you’re aware of the contribution limits for each type of IRA and prioritize funding them, especially if you qualify for a Roth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility and can be useful for goals that are shorter-term than retirement. They are also beneficial for managing tax liabilities, such as capital gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Be strategic about what you hold in taxable accounts—consider investments that generate qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### General Strategy:
- **Diversify Tax Exposure**: Aim to have a mix of pre-tax, tax-deferred, and after-tax accounts to give you flexibility in managing taxes in retirement.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity outside these accounts before maximizing contributions.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly assess your investment performance and goals, adjusting your strategy as needed.
