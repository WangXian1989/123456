Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax obligations. Here’s a strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Choose a mix of growth-oriented investments based on your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may also be tax-advantaged. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.
   
3. **Emergency and Short-term Savings**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies. Keep 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings or money market account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and potential growth. These can hold investments that may generate lower capital gains tax rates (e.g., long-term investments).

5. **Diversification**: Across all accounts, maintain a diversified investment strategy, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your specific situation and goals.
