Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the timing of your withdrawals. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k) and associated fees.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers tax advantages now.
   - Choose based on your expected future tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need before retirement age, as they don’t have early withdrawal penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Balancing Your Portfolio**:
   - Diversify across all accounts to manage risk.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for higher growth investments due to tax deferral or tax-free growth.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
   - Factor in required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your 401(k) and Traditional IRA when planning.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your allocations and adjust as needed based on market conditions and personal changes.

It’s often wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
