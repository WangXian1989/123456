To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, making it a good option for higher-income earners. Consider maxing this out first if you're receiving a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth. A Traditional IRA is tax-deductible, which is great if you're in a higher tax bracket now. Prioritize contributions based on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While taxes apply to dividends and capital gains, these accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Use these for short-term goals or after-tax contributions if you've reached limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to balance risk and return. Common strategies include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, it's advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation and goals.
