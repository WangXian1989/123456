To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**: Determine your financial goals, such as retirement savings, tax minimization, or short-term investment strategies.

2. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically has higher contribution limits and may include employer matching. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages as well, with traditional IRAs being tax-deferred and Roth IRAs offering tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility. You'll pay capital gains tax on returns when you sell investments.

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA if you have not yet maxed out annual contributions in your 401(k).
   - Finally, allocate surplus funds to your taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Adjust your investment strategy based on account type: place high-growth, potentially higher-volatility investments (like equities) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or avoidance. Use more conservative investments for taxable accounts to minimize short-term capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind that withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts will be taxed. Plan your distributions to minimize tax impact in retirement.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies in taxable accounts, such as tax-loss harvesting.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically, adjusting for changes in income, investment performance, and life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial planner to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial goals.
