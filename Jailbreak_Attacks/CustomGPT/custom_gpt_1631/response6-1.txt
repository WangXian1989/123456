Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Immediate Needs vs. Long-Term Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Savings:** If you need liquidity or expect to withdraw funds soon, allocate more towards taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Funds in tax-advantaged accounts can grow tax-free (or tax-deferred for Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s), so prioritize these for long-term investments.

3. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding investments that generate lower tax liabilities (e.g., index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts. This allows for more tax-efficient growth.

4. **Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance:**
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on how much risk you’re willing to take. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) can be better suited for long-term, tax-advantaged accounts.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% of total investment
- **IRA:** 30% of total investment
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20% of total investment

This balance may vary based on personal circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice is often beneficial.
