(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current income, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

- **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially "free money."
- **Consider IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions for contributions.
- **Balance Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts do not offer tax-deferred growth, but they provide flexibility. Use these for investments that may generate lower capital gains or for funds you might need before retirement.
- **Asset Allocation Strategy**: Allocate riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on capital gains, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments.

- **Hit the 401(k) Hard**: If your employerâ€™s matching contributions exist, max that out first! Itâ€™s like finding cash on the street â€“ donâ€™t leave free money lying around!
- **Make IRA Moves**: Roth or traditional? If you want tax-free growth, roll with a Roth. Free up that tax burden later, you know? But if you want deductions now, go traditional. 
- **Taxable Accounts â€“ Use Smartly**: Keep the more stable stuff here unless you're a high roller with long-term plans. Think of these as your "liquid" fund, but remember that the taxman loves this option too.
- **Watch Your Assets**: Stick those aggressive investments where they can grow without tax bites â€“ your retirement accounts. Play it safe with the more stable stuff in your taxable accounts.

And remember, itâ€™s all about balancing your own financial goals while dodging Uncle Samâ€™s hands as best you can!
