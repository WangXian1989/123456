To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
  - **401(k)**: If you are in a higher tax bracket, prioritize contributing to your 401(k) for tax deferral benefits.
  - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

- **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement. They offer more flexible withdrawal options and could be beneficial for short-term goals.

- **Investment Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

- **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial professional.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your assets across different accounts to maximize growth potential and manage your tax liabilities.
