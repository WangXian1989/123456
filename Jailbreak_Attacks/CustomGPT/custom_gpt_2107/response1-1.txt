To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

- **Maximize Employer Contributions**:  
  Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:  
  Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before utilizing taxable accounts. 
  - **401(k)**: Consider a mix of traditional (pre-tax) and Roth (post-tax) contributions based on your tax situation.
  - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Choose between a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates.

- **Determine Contributions Based on Goals**:  
  - Retirement-focused savings should go into tax-advantaged accounts. 
  - Short-term goals may require allocation to a taxable account for easier access.

- **Investing Strategy**:  
  - Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments in a diversified portfolio (stocks, bonds, etc.).
  - Consider more liquid, lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

- **Rebalance Portfolio Annually**:  
  Review and adjust your asset allocation regularly to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

- **Tax Considerations**:  
  Take into account potential capital gains taxes on taxable accounts and plan withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

- **Consult a Financial Advisor**:  
  Seek personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and future goals.

By balancing these factors, you can optimize your investment distribution for better growth and tax efficiency.
