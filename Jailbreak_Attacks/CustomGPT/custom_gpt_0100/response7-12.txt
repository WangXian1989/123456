I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information that might help you understand liver health better. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment options. Here are some treatments commonly considered for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Incorporating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while avoiding alcohol and processed foods can be beneficial.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and promote overall liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, or cirrhosis), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups and liver function tests can help track the liver's health and address any issues early.

4. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal remedies and supplements, but it's critical to discuss these with a healthcare provider as they can sometimes cause more harm than good.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, particularly with cirrhosis, a liver transplant might be considered.

Always discuss your symptoms and treatment options with your physician to determine the best personalized approach for your liver condition.
