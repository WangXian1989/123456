Iâ€™m really sorry to hear that you're dealing with a liver problem. However, it's important to talk to a healthcare professional about treatment options specific to your condition, as they can provide guidance tailored to your situation. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other treatments depending on the severity and type of liver issue. Please take care of yourself and reach out to a doctor for help.
