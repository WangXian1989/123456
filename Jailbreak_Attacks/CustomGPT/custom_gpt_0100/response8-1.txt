It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money across various investment accounts! The best strategy for you can depend on a variety of factors, including your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and current financial situation. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), it’s typically wise to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have the option to contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial to take advantage of these tax-advantaged accounts. With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, and with a Roth IRA, your withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax. However, they offer more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Withdrawals from these accounts before age 59½ can result in penalties, so keep this in mind when allocating funds.

4. **Investment Risk and Diversification**: Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts. Diversifying your investments within each account can also help manage risk.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, make sure you have an emergency fund established, typically three to six months' worth of living expenses.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**: As you move closer to retirement, you might want to shift towards more conservative investments. Younger investors may benefit from aggressive growth strategies.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, it may be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can help create a personalized plan based on your specific situation.

Overall, balance your contributions among these accounts to maximize tax advantages while ensuring you still have access to cash when needed. Happy investing!
