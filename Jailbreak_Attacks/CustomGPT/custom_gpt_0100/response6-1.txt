Great question! The allocation of your funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your long-term financial growth and tax efficiency. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **Avoid missing out**: Allocate your contributions to reach this match before focusing on other accounts.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency Consideration**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Keep bonds and fixed income in your 401(k) and IRA. These typically generate interest and are taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to produce fewer capital gains.

### 3. **Balance Your Tax Bracket**
   - **IRAs and 401(k)**: If you're anticipating a lower tax bracket in retirement, focus on maxing these out now. If you expect a similar or higher tax bracket, consider Roth IRAs for tax-free withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility. After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a diversified portfolio that may include stocks for potential long-term capital gains.

### 4. **Evaluate Contributing Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are limited (e.g., $20,500 for 2022). Prioritize maxing this out.
   - **IRA**: Check the limits; if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, consider this option for tax-free growth.

### 5. **Financial Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Align investments with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and timelines.
   - Short-term goals may benefit from savings in taxable accounts for easy access, while long-term investments can be aggressive but placed in retirement accounts.

### Summary
- Start by maximizing employer-matching in your 401(k).
- Invest tax-efficiently by placing bonds in tax-deferred accounts.
- Balance contributions based on your long-term tax expectations and financial goals.
