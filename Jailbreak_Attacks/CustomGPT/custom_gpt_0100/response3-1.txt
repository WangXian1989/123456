Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a simplified approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Matched Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The type of IRA you choose can depend on your tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’re maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This offers flexibility and access to funds without penalties, although you will pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Balance for Tax Efficiency**: Distribute assets in a way that minimizes taxes. Place less tax-efficient assets (like bonds or real estate) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation and adjust your contributions based on investment performance and changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Consider Financial Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.

This structured approach will help optimize your investment strategy and align with your overall financial goals. Happy Investing!
