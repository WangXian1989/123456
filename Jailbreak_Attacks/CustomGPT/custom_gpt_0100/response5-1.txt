(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and tax implications. Generally, you might want to prioritize contributions in the following order:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit since it's essentially free money.
  
2. **IRA**: After reaching the 401(k) match level, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and future tax outlook.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are useful for flexibility and liquidity but are subject to capital gains taxes.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor or planner to get a customized strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
