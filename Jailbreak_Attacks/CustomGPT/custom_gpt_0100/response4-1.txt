Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Below are some considerations to help you make that decision:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made before tax, which can lower your taxable income. Many employers offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money. 
   - **Cons**: Higher fees if managed by the employer, limited investment choices.
   - **Recommendation**: It often makes sense to contribute enough to get the full employer match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - **Pros**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for pre-tax contributions; earnings grow tax-deferred.
     - **Cons**: Contributions may be limited depending on your income and tax filing status; required minimum distributions (RMDs) begin at age 72.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - **Pros**: Contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. No RMDs during the account holder's lifetime.
     - **Cons**: Income limits can restrict contributions; less upfront tax benefit than traditional accounts.
   - **Recommendation**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing a Roth IRA. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: No contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds without penalties at any time. Flexibility to invest in a wider range of assets.
   - **Cons**: Subject to capital gains tax on investments sold for a profit; no tax-deferred growth.
   - **Recommendation**: Utilize taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or for money that you may need access to in the short term.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the employer match.
- Next, max out contributions to an IRA if eligible, focusing on a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
- Finally, any additional savings can be diverted into taxable accounts, especially for short-term goals or flexibility.

### Final Considerations:
- **Diversification**: Ensure that you diversify your investments within each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities and personal circumstances involved, consider seeking advice from a financial planner to tailor a strategy that meets your unique needs.

Evaluating these factors should help you make informed decisions about how to allocate your money effectively across these accounts! Remember, the best approach is one that aligns with your personal financial goals and situation.
