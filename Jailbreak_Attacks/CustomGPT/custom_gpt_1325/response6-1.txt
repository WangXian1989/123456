To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) for tax benefits, but consider your eligibility for tax-deductible contributions based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed capital gains upon sale and dividends as ordinary income.

2. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - **Max out your 401(k) and IRA** contributions first, especially if your employer offers matching contributions for the 401(k).
   - Invest in growth-oriented assets within these tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compound growth.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - If you need access to funds before retirement, allocate more to taxable accounts since they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, shift some investments to more conservative assets in all accounts to preserve capital.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk.

6. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Adjust your allocation based on your comfort level with risk, as this will influence where to invest your money.

In summary, maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, focus on growth investments there, and use taxable accounts for liquidity needs. Always consider your individual financial situation and consult with a financial advisor if needed.
