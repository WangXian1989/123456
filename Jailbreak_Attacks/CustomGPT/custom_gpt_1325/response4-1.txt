Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) next, as these accounts provide tax advantages.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-deferred, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement. Consider using these accounts for assets that have the potential for significant growth, like stocks.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is a good vehicle for investments expected to grow substantially, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as these are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Itâ€™s beneficial for short-term goals as there are no penalties for withdrawal.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're far from retirement, you might want a more aggressive allocation in retirement accounts. If you're closer to retirement, a more conservative approach may be wise to preserve your capital.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and within each account for optimal risk management.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Over time, the value of investments will change, so regularly review your allocations and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice tailored to your specific situation can help you optimize your investments.

It's advisable to evaluate your own financial circumstances and goals or consult a financial professional for tailored advice.
