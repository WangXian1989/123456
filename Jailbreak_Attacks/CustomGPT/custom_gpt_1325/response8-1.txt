When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits**: Take advantage of higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want potential tax deductions now, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for more immediate financial goals.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Consider holding investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **Max out the 401(k) contributions** to take advantage of employer matches first.
- **Contribute to an IRA** (Traditional or Roth) based on your tax situation.
- Finally, invest in taxable accounts for greater liquidity and flexibility.

### Important Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Align your allocation with your financial goals (retirement, short-term savings, etc.).
- **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger individuals can afford to take more risks; older individuals might want to balance their portfolios toward more conservative investments.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific situation.
