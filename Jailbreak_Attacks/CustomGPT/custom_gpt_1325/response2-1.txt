The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Higher Contribution Limits**: 401(k) plans generally allow for higher contribution limits compared to IRAs, so if available, prioritize contributions to this account.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide if you want a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes paid on withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (contributions made after-tax, tax-free withdrawals). Your current and expected future tax rate can influence this choice.
   - **Tax Diversification**: Having both a traditional and Roth IRA can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexible access to your funds without penalties or required minimum distributions (RMDs) at any age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Contribute first to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, then fund your IRA to maximize your tax-advantaged savings, and finally invest in taxable accounts for additional savings.
2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts; long-term capital gains tax rates are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.
3. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy periodically, especially as your financial situation and tax laws change.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor your investment strategy based on your specific circumstances and financial goals. They can provide insights into your overall financial plan, tax situation, and market conditions.
