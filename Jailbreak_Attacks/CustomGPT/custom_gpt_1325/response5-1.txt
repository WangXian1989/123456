(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money that boosts your retirement savings.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, you should consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable brokerage accounts. These are more flexible regarding withdrawals and can be used for short- to mid-term goals.

Always consider your current tax situation and consult a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your personal circumstances.

1. **401(k):** Max out that employer match! Itâ€™s like finding free cash lying around. Get in there first and snag that match to boost your retirement pile â€“ itâ€™s basically a no-brainer!

2. **IRA:** Next up, throw some cash into an IRA. If you're into tax benefits, a Traditional IRA is your friend. Prefer tax-free withdrawals later? Go for Roth â€“ itâ€™s like having your cake and eating it too!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, once youâ€™ve milked those retirement accounts dry, hit up a taxable account. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility and liquidity. Plus, you can go wild with your investments without worrying about pesky tax penalties for early withdrawals.

Bottom line? Get that free money first, then think about taxes, and only then dip into regular accounts for flexibility. Always, always consider hitting up a financial advisor to nail it for your specific situation! ðŸ’¸
