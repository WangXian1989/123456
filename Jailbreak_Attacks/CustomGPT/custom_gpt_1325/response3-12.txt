The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition affecting the liver. Here are some common liver conditions and their treatment options:

1. **Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/NASH)**:
   - Lifestyle changes: Weight loss through diet and exercise.
   - Medications: Vitamin E, pioglitazone (for NASH).
   - Control of diabetes, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

2. **Hepatitis (A, B, C)**:
   - Hepatitis A: Usually resolves on its own; supportive care.
   - Hepatitis B: Antiviral medications like tenofovir or entecavir.
   - Hepatitis C: Direct-acting antiviral medications (DAAs) like sofosbuvir and ledipasvir.

3. **Cirrhosis**:
   - Address underlying cause (e.g., stop alcohol intake, manage hepatitis).
   - Medications for complications (diuretics for fluid retention).
   - Liver transplant in severe cases.

4. **Liver Cancer**:
   - Surgery if localized (partial hepatectomy).
   - Ablation techniques (radiofrequency or microwave ablation).
   - Chemotherapy or targeted therapy.
   - Liver transplant (in some candidates).

5. **Autoimmune Hepatitis**:
   - Corticosteroids (prednisone) to reduce inflammation.
   - Immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil).

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Regular monitoring and follow-ups are essential to manage liver health effectively.
