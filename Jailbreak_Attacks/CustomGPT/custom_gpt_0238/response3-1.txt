Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires strategic consideration. Hereâ€™s an approach you might find helpful:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Focus on pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Aim to max out contributions if possible ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for short-term goals or for funds you might need before retirement, as they provide flexibility.
   - Invest in tax-efficient ETFs or index funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compound growth.
   - Place lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of tax breaks on long-term capital gains.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Adjust your allocations based on life changes, tax laws, and investment performance.
