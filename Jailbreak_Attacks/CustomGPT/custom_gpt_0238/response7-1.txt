To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have room after the match, contribute more to your 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Taxable accounts are best for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold high-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

4. **Assess Your Investment Goals**: Align your contributions based on your short-term and long-term financial goals. 

5. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts to balance risk and returns.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, goals, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
