Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**: Once you've funded your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings or investments once you've maximized your retirement accounts. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency. Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes effectively.

6. **Reevaluate Annually**: Regularly review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.
