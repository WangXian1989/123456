When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matchingâ€”this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing the employer match, focus on your IRA (Traditional or Roth). This can offer tax benefits depending on your income and future tax expectations.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: If you still have room to contribute, continue to invest in your 401(k) beyond the match, especially if it offers good investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any savings beyond your tax-advantaged accounts. These can be more flexible, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Investment Choices**: In tax-advantaged accounts, consider holding assets that generate high returns or dividends (which are taxed at a higher rate in taxable accounts), while placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investments with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

Consulting a financial advisor is also a good idea for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
