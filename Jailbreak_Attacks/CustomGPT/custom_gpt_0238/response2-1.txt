To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. If eligible, a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Consider your current tax bracket; if you're in a lower bracket now, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

### 3. **Balance Between Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have cash set aside in a taxable account to cover emergencies.

### 4. **Consider Investment Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically has limited investment options; choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Offers a wider range of investment choices; consider diversifying across stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains.

### 5. **Review Regularly**
   - Periodically assess your allocation based on market conditions and personal financial goals. Adjust contributions accordingly.

### 6. **Long-Term Goals**
   - Focus on long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping more liquid investments in taxable accounts.

### Conclusion
A balanced approach, maximizing tax advantages and aligning your investments with your financial goals, will help you distribute your money effectively across your accounts. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
