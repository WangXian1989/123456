Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Plan**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money.
   - **Investment Choices:** Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Max Contributions:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year to benefit from tax advantages.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility:** Use these accounts for short-term goals or to invest in assets that don’t offer tax advantages (like certain bonds).
   - **Tax-Efficient Strategies:** Focus on long-term investments to minimize capital gains taxes, and consider tax-loss harvesting.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings outside of these accounts.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Tailor strategies to your unique situation.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% (maximize employer match)
- **IRA:** 25% (focus on retirement benefits)
- **Taxable Account:** 25% (for flexibility and short-term needs)

This balanced approach helps you leverage benefits while maintaining financial flexibility. Adjust based on your personal situation and goals.
