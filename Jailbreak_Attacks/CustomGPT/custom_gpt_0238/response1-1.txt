Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out if possible, especially if you have a high income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Before maxing out your taxable account, ensure you have contributed adequately to your 401(k) and IRA. Tax-advantaged accounts can reduce your taxable income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds) within each account to reduce risk. Consider your age and risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, use taxable accounts first for short-term needs to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold bond funds and high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher taxes on income.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
