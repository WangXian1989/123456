To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Typically has tax advantages; consider maxing out employer match.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Offers tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals; choose based on current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for short-term investments; subject to capital gains tax.

### 2. **Distribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
     - Max out IRA contributions if eligible.
   - **Balance Taxable Accounts:**
     - Use for investments that generate lower taxable income (e.g., index funds).
     - Keep high-turnover investments (e.g., actively managed funds) out to minimize taxable events.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-deferred accounts.
   - Keep higher-yielding assets (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 4. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and life changes to maintain your target risk level.

By following these principles, you can create a tax-efficient investment strategy that caters to your financial goals.
