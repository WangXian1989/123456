Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contribute as much as possible to these tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if you have an employer match in your 401(k). Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds) or for assets you plan to hold for a longer time, benefiting from long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Consider keeping higher-growth assets like stocks in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Allocate less volatile investments, like bonds, to taxable accounts since they generate regular income that can be taxed at your ordinary tax rate.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Think about your liquidity needs. If you might need access to your money before retirement, maintain a portion in taxable accounts.
   - Plan your withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts strategically during retirement to minimize taxes.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market changes and your risk tolerance.

5. **Consulting a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Always tailor your approach to your unique circumstances and consider both your current financial situation and future goals.
