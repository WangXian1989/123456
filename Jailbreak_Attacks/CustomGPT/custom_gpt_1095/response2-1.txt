Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Short-term Goals**: Savings for near-term needs should be in more accessible, lower-risk investments (e.g., taxable accounts).
   - **Long-term Goals**: Retirement-focused investments should benefit from tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you don’t pay taxes until withdrawal, which is good if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 4. **Risk Diversification**
   - Balance your asset allocation among stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance.
   - Typically, more aggressive investments should be held in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Keep 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in an accessible form (like a savings account) before heavily investing.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then direct additional funds to an IRA if eligible.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if feasible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on tax-efficient options like index funds or ETFs.

### 7. **Consult a Professional**
- A financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation and goals.

This balanced approach will help you optimize your savings while accounting for tax implications and investment growth potential.
