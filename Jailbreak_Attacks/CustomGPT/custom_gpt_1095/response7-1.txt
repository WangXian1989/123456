Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching. Contributions reduce your taxable income, but you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but with potentially different contribution limits and investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; you pay capital gains taxes on profits. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Consider Your Financial Goals**:
   - If your primary goal is retirement savings, prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then consider maxing out your IRA contributions.
   - For short-term goals (like saving for a house), focus on taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Generally, invest in tax-advantaged accounts first. Max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to reduce your taxable income.
   - Use taxable accounts to manage investments that may have lower capital gains taxes, like index funds or ETFs.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Higher-risk assets might perform better in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your strategy and make adjustments based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute up to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions if eligible (e.g., $6,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any remaining funds in diversified assets.
