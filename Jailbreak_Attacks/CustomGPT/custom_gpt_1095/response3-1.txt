Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), consider contributing at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now. Withdrawals are taxed as income in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income in taxable accounts is subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding investments for longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before maximizing retirement contributions. This typically covers 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - If you’re closer to retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts that offer growth (e.g., Roth IRA).
   - If you have a long investment horizon, a mix of tax-deferred and taxable accounts can be beneficial.

5. **Diversification**: Use a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, these are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50)

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you’ll withdraw from these accounts in retirement. Generally, it’s advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally, tax-free accounts like Roth IRAs.

**Example Distribution**:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) for the employer match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility.
