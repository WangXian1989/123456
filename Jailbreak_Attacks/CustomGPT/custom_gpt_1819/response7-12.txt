I'm not qualified to provide medical advice, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem and explore appropriate treatment options. They may recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies based on your specific condition. Always prioritize professional medical guidance for health-related issues.
