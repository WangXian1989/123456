To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax benefits while you defer taxes until withdrawal. Often, employers provide matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Also offers tax advantages, either tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA). Contributions have limits, and withdrawals rules vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes but offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your investment time horizon and liquidity needs. Long-term goals can lean towards retirement accounts, while short-term needs might require cash in taxable accounts.

3. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) for investments with higher taxes on dividends and capital gains. Hold lower-turnover investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Utilize IRA Options**:
   - If eligible, consider putting contributions into a Roth IRA for future tax-free withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

6. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. The aggregate portfolio should align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Review Contributions Annually**:
   - Review and adjust contributions as needed, especially if there are changes in income, tax laws, or investment opportunities.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal advice tailored to your situation can provide insights based on your unique financial goals and circumstances.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that looks at both tax efficiency and your long-term financial strategy will help you effectively distribute your money across these accounts.
