To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Identify your retirement goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Are you saving for short-term needs, or are you focused on long-term growth?

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50), and there are no limits on taxable accounts.

3. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - *401(k)*: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes on the money until you withdraw it in retirement.
   - *IRA*: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - *Taxable Accounts*: You'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, ensure that you have a well-diversified portfolio. This may include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As you contribute more to these accounts, regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. 

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you have specific financial circumstances or complexity, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers your current financial situation, future goals, and the unique benefits of each account type will yield the best results.
