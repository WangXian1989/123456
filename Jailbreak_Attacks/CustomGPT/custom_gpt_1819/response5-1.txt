(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Typically, the general advice is to prioritize contributions to accounts with the most tax advantages first. For many, this means maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money." After reaching any employer matching limit, consider funding your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals. Lastly, you can contribute to taxable accounts with any remaining funds, which provide flexibility and access to your money at any time but typically don't offer the same tax advantages as the other accounts.

First, go all in on that 401(k), especially if your employer's matching youâ€”it's free cash, baby! Max that out! Next, look at your IRA; if youâ€™ve got a choice between a Traditional and Roth, think about whether you want taxes now or later. If you like the idea of tax-free cash flow in retirement, lean towards a Roth. After you've knocked out those tax-advantaged accounts, sprinkle whatever's left in your taxable accounts. Just remember, they may not come with the sweet tax breaks, but they give you liquidity and instant access. It's like having a stash of cash for your spontaneous adventures! Get it right, and your future self will thank you! ðŸ’¸
