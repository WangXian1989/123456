Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, current income, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals. If you’re in a lower bracket now, a Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction upfront.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Keep tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-sheltered accounts (401(k) and IRAs).
   - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: 
   - If retirement is far off, focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - As you near retirement, gradually shift to more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a taxable account before maxing out retirement accounts. Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations at least annually based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your specific circumstances.
