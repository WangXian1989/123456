The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to reduce your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you have a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts based on your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes when selling.

### 4. **Retirement Timeline**
   - **Near Retirement**: Shift focus towards safer, income-generating investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented assets in your taxable accounts if you have a longer time horizon.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s wise to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, to manage tax implications.

### Conclusion
Tailor your contributions based on these factors, regularly reviewing and adjusting your strategy as your financial situation or goals change. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
