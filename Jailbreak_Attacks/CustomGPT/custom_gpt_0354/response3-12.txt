I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet low in fats and sugar; include fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs** for hepatitis.
   - **Steroids** for autoimmune liver disease.
   - **Diuretics** for fluid retention.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoid Alcohol**:
   - Abstaining from alcohol helps prevent further liver damage.

5. **Supplements**:
   - Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.

6. **Surgery**:
   - In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
