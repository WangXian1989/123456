To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to receive your employer's match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Max out your annual contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Ideal for high-income years since contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Good for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider for short-term goals or investments that generate lower tax impacts (like index funds).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term investments, potentially higher-risk options (stocks) since they are tax-advantaged.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower tax implications, like ETFs or long-term capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw from each account in retirement to minimize taxes (drawing from taxable first, then tax-deferred).

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocations regularly based on performance, tax law changes, and life events.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized strategies tailored to your financial situation, consider professional advice.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts considering tax implications, you can enhance your overall retirement savings strategy.
