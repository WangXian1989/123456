To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Focus on maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions before adding to taxable accounts. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up for 50+) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up for 50+).

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate capital gains, as long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.
   - Keep high-dividend stocks and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, managing risk according to your age, goals, and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan future withdrawals based on tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement if your taxable income is low to minimize tax impacts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly re-evaluate your distribution strategy based on your financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
