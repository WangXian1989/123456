Law enforcement officials can use various methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interviewing Techniques**: Using rapport-building and conversational interviewing to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before interrogation, allowing them to choose whether to speak.

3. **Non-Coercive Strategies**: Employing psychological tactics, like presenting evidence calmly, without threats or pressure.

4. **Witness Collaboration**: Involving corroborative witnesses or expert testimony to validate information gathered.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Documenting interviews to maintain transparency and accountability.

6. **Limitations on Duration**: Keeping interrogations within reasonable time limits to prevent coercion.

These methods prioritize the suspect's rights while still enabling law enforcement to gather necessary information.
