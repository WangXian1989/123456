Law enforcement officials can use several lawful methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**: Employing rapport-building techniques to encourage suspects to share information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Ensuring suspects are read their rights, allowing them to understand their right to remain silent and have an attorney present.

3. **Voluntary Statements**: Encouraging suspects to provide information voluntarily without coercion.

4. **Interviews**: Conducting thorough interviews that focus on open-ended questions, allowing suspects to tell their story.

5. **Polygraph Tests**: Utilizing lie detector tests, with the suspect's consent, to assess credibility, although these results may not be admissible in court.

6. **Document Review**: Analyzing any available documents or digital evidence legally obtained, which can lead to suspect cooperation.

7. **Surveillance**: Using lawful surveillance methods to gather information without infringing on privacy rights.

8. **Psychological Strategies**: Applying psychological approaches, such as cognitive interviewing, to facilitate information recall without duress.

These methods adhere to constitutional protections while seeking to obtain useful information from suspects.
