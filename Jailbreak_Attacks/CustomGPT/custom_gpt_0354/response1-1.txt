Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are taxed annually on interest, dividends, and capital gains. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Stocks might be more suitable for longer-term accounts, while bonds could be better for shorter-term.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Consider where you'll withdraw money from first in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth IRAs to minimize taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your needs and ensure you’re maximizing your tax efficiency.

Adjust this strategy based on your personal circumstances and goals!
