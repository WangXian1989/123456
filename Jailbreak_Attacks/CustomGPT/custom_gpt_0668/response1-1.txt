Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing the maximum if you are in a lower tax bracket. Money grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA. Choose a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts. This can provide flexibility for early withdrawals and investments that might generate favorable long-term capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**: Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance, with a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all accounts. Generally:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments.
   - **IRA**: Consider a mix that aligns with your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize tax liability.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you get closer to retirement, consider a withdrawal strategy that minimizes tax implications, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation.
