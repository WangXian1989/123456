To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred retirement account often with employer matching. Focus on maxing out contributions, especially to capture any match.
   - **IRA**: Can be either traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Depending on your income, you may want to contribute to one or both types.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Use these for shorter-term goals or after maxing out retirement accounts.

2. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to minimize taxes on growth.
   - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Balance Investments**:
   - Consider asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account based on your overall risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Monitor your accounts annually and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or personal goals.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider discussing with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By balancing tax advantages, investment types, and your financial goals, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your retirement savings.
