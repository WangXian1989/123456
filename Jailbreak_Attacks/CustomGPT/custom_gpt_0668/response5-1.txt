(🔒Normal Output) Distributing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially since contributions are tax-deferred.

2. **IRA**: Invest in an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions in the contribution year.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate frequent capital gains or income (like dividends) since these are taxed differently than retirement accounts. Consider holding assets with lower turnover here.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your individual circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First off, you definitely want to snag that free employer match like it's a last slice of pizza! Go for the max contribution if you can. It's tax-deferred, so you're investing pre-tax dollars—which is a win-win situation.

2. **IRA**: Next up, think about IRAs. If you can swing a Roth IRA, do it! Your future self will high-five you when those tax-free withdrawals roll in. Just remember, a Traditional IRA can also be a solid option if you need a tax break now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, stash some cash in a taxable account for flexibility. This is your “I want money now” zone. Just be smart about it—stick to ETFs or index funds with low turnover to avoid getting nailed by taxes on every little gain.

Mix it up, and don’t hesitate to consult a financial wizard to craft your ideal strategy! 🤑✨
