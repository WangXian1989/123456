To determine the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:** Define your short-term and long-term financial goals, such as retirement savings, buying a home, or funding education.

2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for that year. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal, typically in retirement when your tax rate may be lower.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Contributions are made after-tax, and you will pay capital gains taxes on earnings when you sell investments. Interest and dividends are also taxable in the year they are received.

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:** Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is typically $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while an IRA has a limit of $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Consider Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It’s essentially “free money.”

5. **Diversify Investments:** Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in both retirement and taxable accounts.

6. **Balance Savings Across Accounts:** Depending on your goals:
   - Prioritize higher contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) up to the limits and employer match.
   - Allocate remaining funds to your taxable account for more immediate liquidity and flexibility, especially if you have short-term goals.

7. **Reassess Periodically:** Investment needs and financial situations change. Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on changing goals or market conditions.

Based on these factors, tailor your distribution strategy to maximize tax efficiency and meet your financial goals effectively.
