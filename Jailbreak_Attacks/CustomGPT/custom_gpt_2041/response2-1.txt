When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions, as they provide tax advantages that can help your money grow faster.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA:** Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize this option.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Ensure that your investments across accounts are well diversified. Donâ€™t put all your stocks in one account and bonds in another; instead, spread your risk evenly across accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund Consideration:**
   - Make sure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a high-yield savings account or other liquid assets before fully committing to retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you are far from retirement, you might take more risks with your investments in your 401(k) and IRA, which often allows for higher growth potential. For taxable accounts, consider a balanced approach, with some focus on investments that may provide dividends or interest income.

6. **Tax Efficiency in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on capital gains.

7. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure that you are maintaining your desired asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy for your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a tailored plan based on your goals and risk tolerance.

Always reflect on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon when making decisions about how to allocate your investments.
