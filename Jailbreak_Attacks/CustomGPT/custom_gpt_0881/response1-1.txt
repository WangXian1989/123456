Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer matches contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing that out for tax-free growth. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, which can also be beneficial.

2. **Balance contributions based on tax implications**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use these for investments beyond your retirement accounts but be mindful of capital gains taxes. Theyâ€™re good for short-term goals or after-tax investments.

3. **Consider your investment strategy**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Put more stable income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Review regularly**: Your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals may change, so revisit your allocation periodically.

For a more personalized strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations based on your unique circumstances.
