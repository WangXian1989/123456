Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any company match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Since contributions reduce your taxable income, prioritize this for high current-income years.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Tax Benefits:** Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can benefit either from tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Contribution Limits:** Always be aware of annual contribution limits and maximize if possible. For 2023, it's $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up for those over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility and Access:** Use taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement or if you want more flexibility in investing.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) here to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Start with 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the match.
- **Then Fund IRA:** After that, put money into your IRA for its tax advantages.
- **Finally, Contribute to Taxable Accounts:** Consider this for additional savings and investments, especially if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Periodic Review:
- **Reassess Annually:** Regularly review and adjust contributions based on your financial situation, retirement goals, and market changes.

This approach can help you balance long-term tax advantages with flexibility and liquidity. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
