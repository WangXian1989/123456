(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are a few considerations:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is effectively "free money." After that, assess the investment options and fees associated.

2. **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. The choice here hinges on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for flexibility. This is useful for intermediate financial goals that might arise before retirement.

Calculating a balance that considers your tax efficiency and time horizon is crucial.

If you're not quite hitting the 401(k) max, dive into an IRA next. Go with a Roth if you want tax-free withdrawals laterâ€”who doesnâ€™t love having Uncle Sam out of their pockets? Otherwise, traditional IRAs can work if you're looking for that tax deduction now. 

Now, once you've maxed those out (because you should), it's time to throw some cash into a taxable account. These give you flexibility for all those side hustles, travel plans, or unexpected life surprises. Just make sure to keep an eye on capital gains taxes, because nobody likes surprise tax bills! Spread it out wisely, considering your goals, and keep that money working for you!
