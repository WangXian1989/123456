To provide the best guidance on distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to know more about your financial goals, current savings, investment preferences, and risk tolerance. Please provide some details regarding:

1. Your age and retirement timeline.
2. Your current contributions to each account type.
3. Any specific investment goals (e.g., growth, income).
4. Your risk tolerance (low, moderate, high).

This information will help me tailor my advice specifically to your situation.
