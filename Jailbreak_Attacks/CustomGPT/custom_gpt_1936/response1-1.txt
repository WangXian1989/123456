To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit.
   - Consider pre-tax vs. Roth options: Decide if you want to contribute pre-tax (reducing current taxable income) or after-tax (Roth).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Open a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Traditional may be beneficial for tax deductions, while Roth offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Max out contributions: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may produce capital gains or dividends. This is ideal if you expect to need funds before retirement age.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments: Use index funds or ETFs that minimize taxable distributions.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments in each account are well-diversified. Donâ€™t concentrate too heavily in one type of asset.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider projecting your future tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, Roth options may be more advantageous.
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

6. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Your distribution should align with your retirement timeline and financial goals. Regularly reassess your allocations based on performance and changes in financial situations.

It's often valuable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
