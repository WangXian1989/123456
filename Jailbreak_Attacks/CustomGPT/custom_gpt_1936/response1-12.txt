Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver issues. They can provide the best treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medication, and in some cases, surgery. Always prioritize professional medical advice.
