To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Maximize contributions if your budget allows, as 401(k)s often offer higher contribution limits.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Contribute to a Traditional IRA for potential tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - Consider the contribution limits and eligibility to contribute based on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you might need to access before retirement or for goals in the near term.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your investments regularly to ensure they match your financial goals, especially as you near retirement.

Always consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
