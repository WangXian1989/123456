I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Follow a healthy diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis.
   - **Immunosuppressants**: For autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Limiting or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, especially with liver damage, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
