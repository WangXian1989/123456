When distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—it's free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: These accounts grow tax-free until you withdraw in retirement. Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible access to funds. They’re also beneficial for investments that generate long-term capital gains, which may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk. Consider mixing stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA) to take advantage of tax brackets.

5. **Consider Roth Accounts**: If available, Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them an excellent option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations annually to maintain your target asset mix.

7. **Professional Advice**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation and retirement goals.

By carefully considering these aspects, you can optimize your investment distribution effectively.
