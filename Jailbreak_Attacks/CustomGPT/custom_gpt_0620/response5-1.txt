(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, investment timeline, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Generally, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These can grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type of account.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate higher short-term capital gains or for funds you might need in the near future since you can access them without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where your earnings won't be taxed until withdrawal.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice suited to your specific circumstances.
