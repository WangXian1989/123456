Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. For 2024, consider the annual contribution limit ($23,000 for those under 50 and $30,000 for those 50 and older). 
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 for those under 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need before retirement or for investments that create lots of taxable income (like bonds). They’re also useful for investments that can appreciate over time and be sold at a lower tax rate (capital gains).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, holding more aggressive investments (e.g., stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your portfolio and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

5. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Understand the tax implications of withdrawing from taxable versus tax-advantaged accounts.

In summary, maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first, consider your overall tax situation, diversify your investments across all accounts, and adjust as needed based on your goals and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your situation.
