Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limit**: Be mindful of contribution limits ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxed on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (taxed upfront but tax-free withdrawals). This choice can impact your tax strategy.
   - **Yearly Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits (up to $6,500 for 2024, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to in the near term, as they don’t have the withdrawal restrictions of retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain an appropriate asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type, adjusting for the tax implications of each.
   - **Tax-Deferred vs. Taxable**: Place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compounding, while using taxable accounts for more stable income-producing investments.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - **Adjustments**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.
