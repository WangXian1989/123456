Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in your taxable account to cover unexpected expenses (typically 3-6 months of living expenses).

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions (up to the annual limit) while taking advantage of any employer match. The tax-deferred growth can be beneficial, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice depends on your current tax bracket and retirement plans.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may need to access before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains tax.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across different asset classes—such as stocks, bonds, and real estate—to spread risk.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your specific circumstances.
