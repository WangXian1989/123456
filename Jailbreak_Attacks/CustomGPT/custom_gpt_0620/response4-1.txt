Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your investment goals, tax situation, and timeline for accessing the funds. Hereâ€™s a general approach to think about:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize employer match first: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Focus on tax-deferred growth: Contributions to a 401(k) reduce your taxable income, providing tax benefits while your investments grow.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions: If you qualify, contributions to a Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Roth IRA for tax-free growth: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, where you pay taxes upfront but enjoy tax-free withdrawals later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use for goals that are shorter-term: Taxable accounts are best for savings goals that you might want to access before retirement (like buying a house).
   - Be mindful of taxes on gains: Investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider placing investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep an eye on asset allocation across all accounts to ensure diversification.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth and more volatile investments, while more stable investments can go in taxable accounts.

5. **Revisit Annually**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.

Each person's situation is unique, so it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances and financial objectives.
