To provide a tailored strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider your individual financial situation including your income, retirement goals, tax bracket, and investment objectives. 

Generally, a good approach could be:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
  
2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Once youâ€™re getting the full match in your 401(k), consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (if eligible). This account can provide tax advantages depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.
   
3. **Continue Contributing to 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This also helps reduce your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need access to before retirement or for investment strategies that may not suit tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains from taxable accounts can be taxed at different rates.

7. **Review Annually**: Reassess your strategy yearly to adjust for changes in your financial situation or retirement goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor could provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
