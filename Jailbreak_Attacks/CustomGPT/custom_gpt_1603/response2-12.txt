I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems as they can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments may vary depending on the underlying cause of liver issues, such as lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgery. Please reach out to a medical expert for the best guidance.
