When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach based on a few factors:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, contributions could be tax-deductible or made after-tax, affecting your tax situation at retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You'll pay capital gains tax on earnings when you sell investments, so consider using this account for investments you'll hold long-term or for shorter-term goals.

3. **Retirement Goals**: Think about your long-term goals. If you're aiming for retirement, the 401(k) and IRA are designed specifically for that purpose, while taxable accounts can provide greater flexibility for other financial goals.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to spread risk. Each account can have different investment options and tax strategies.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. Make sure to allocate your funds accordingly to maximize your contributions without exceeding these limits.

6. **Time Horizon**: Consider when you'll need the money. Funds in retirement accounts are generally intended for long-term use, while taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that incorporates your financial situation, tax implications, and retirement goals will be most effective. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your circumstances.
