Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any company match, as this is free money. If you can afford to, consider contributing the maximum allowed to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth). With a Traditional IRA, your contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax money but grow tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributions from 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAs and certain taxable accounts may have different tax implications upon withdrawal or sale of assets.
   - Holding investments for over a year in taxable accounts can qualify for long-term capital gains tax, which is typically lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate more volatile investments (like stocks) to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as they can benefit more from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Keep more stable assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of potentially lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Periodically review and adjust the asset allocation among these accounts to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
   
5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an appropriate amount of liquid assets available in your taxable accounts for emergencies before maximizing contributions to retirement accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every financial situation is unique. Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your overall financial picture.

Ultimately, regularly contributing to these accounts while considering the associated tax implications will help you build a more secure financial future.
