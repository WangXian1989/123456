The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Bracket**: Distributing funds according to your current tax rate can be advantageous. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA are tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income in the present but are taxed upon withdrawal. In contrast, Roth contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, making them a good option for investing money you might need before retirement. They can also provide tax efficiency through long-term capital gains if you hold investments for over a year.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments based on risk tolerance. Place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to benefit from tax-free growth, while more conservative investments might work better in a taxable account.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to maximize tax efficiency. For example, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Continually assess your investments and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized strategy that takes into account your specific circumstances and objectives.
