Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: Consider maxing out your employer’s match if available. This is essentially free money. Depending on your age and income, you may want to prioritize these accounts, especially if they offer good investment options with low fees.

2. **IRA Accounts**: You can contribute to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in a taxable account. These accounts offer more flexibility with no contribution limits or early withdrawal penalties, but keep an eye on capital gains taxes.

4. **Considerations**: 
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before heavily investing.
   - **Debt**: If you have high-interest debt, focus on paying that off first.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Keep in mind your overall investment strategy (risk tolerance, time horizon). Diversification is key across all accounts.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.
