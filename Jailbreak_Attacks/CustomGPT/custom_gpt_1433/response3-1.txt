The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After taking full advantage of the employer match, consider contributing more to your 401(k) if you can. This account has higher contribution limits than IRAs and grows tax-deferred.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, contributing to an IRA can be beneficial. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Decide which is best based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - If you qualify, prioritize maxing out a Roth IRA for its tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you're younger or expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, but remember that you'll owe taxes on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks with a higher allocation to stocks, while those closer to retirement may need to reduce risk with more bonds or fixed income.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and investment performance.

In summary, start with the employer match in your 401(k), then maximize contributions in both your 401(k) and IRA based on tax implications, and use taxable accounts for additional savings. Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual needs.
