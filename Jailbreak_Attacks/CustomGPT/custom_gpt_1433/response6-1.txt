To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement. Consider maxing out employer matches to maximize benefits.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you prefer tax savings now or later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed during the year as capital gains or dividends are realized. This is where you can invest in more liquid and higher-risk assets without penalties for early withdrawal.

2. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a mix of stocks and bonds suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Target-date funds can be a good option for liability matching.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a wider range of investment options (ETFs, individual stocks, bonds) compared to a 401(k). This flexibility can enhance diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Aim for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds or index funds, which typically produce fewer taxable events.

3. **Goal-Oriented Allocation**:
   - Assess your blend based on when you plan to access the funds:
     - **Short-term (0-5 years)**: Focus on liquid, safer investments in taxable accounts.
     - **Medium-term (5-10 years)**: Consider a balanced approach with moderate growth investments in IRAs and taxable accounts.
     - **Long-term (10+ years)**: Prioritize growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for maximum compounding.

By thoughtfully allocating your investments among these accounts with consideration to tax implications, investment vehicles, and your specific financial goals, you can craft a strategy that aligns with both your immediate and long-term financial needs.
