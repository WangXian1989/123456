When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment preferences. Here is a balanced approach:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Contribute to Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (taxed contributions, tax-free withdrawals). This depends on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If you're able, contribute the maximum allowable limit to your 401(k) after your IRA contributions. This can be particularly beneficial if you are in a high tax bracket, as it reduces your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investment goals. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices but be mindful of potential capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline:
    - Place more growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.
    - Consider placing more stable investments (like bonds and dividends) in taxable accounts, where taxing can be more favorable.
  
6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investments and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Overall, prioritizing tax-advantaged accounts first, especially if your employer offers a match, generally leads to more efficient wealth accumulation over the long term. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy that fits your unique circumstances.
