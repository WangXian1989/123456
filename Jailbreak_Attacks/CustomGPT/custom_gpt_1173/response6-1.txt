Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach to maximize tax efficiency and investment growth. Here are some considerations to guide your allocation:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the full match from your employer; this is essentially "free money."
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth Options**: Decide whether a traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (post-tax) 401(k) is more beneficial based on your current tax bracket and expected future income. 

2. **IRA Allocations**:
   - **Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), choose between pre-tax and post-tax contributions based on your retirement timing and tax strategy.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for both Traditional and Roth IRAs to avoid penalties.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term investments or goals that may require quicker access to funds.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes, and hold onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Overall Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (which may incur significant taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) or IRA) while using taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments.
   - **Regular Rebalancing**: Reassess your investment allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

By employing these strategies, you can optimize your investments across each account type for long-term growth and tax efficiency. For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor.
