Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Max out employer-sponsored plans**: If your 401(k) offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money!

2. **Consider tax implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k) in that contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you follow the rules. This can be beneficial if you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments grow and are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. They can be more flexible for withdrawals but lack the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Diversify investments**: Within each account type, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes to manage risk.

4. **Set investment goals**: Your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline play a big role in how aggressively you should invest in these accounts.

5. **Rebalance regularly**: Over time, your asset allocation may shift due to market performance, so it’s essential to review and adjust your investments periodically.

6. **Consult with a financial advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

Always keep your long-term goals in mind, and consider how contributions to each account can help you achieve those goals efficiently from a tax and growth perspective.
