(Î±) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your age, income, tax situation, and investment goals. Here are some general tips to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to take full advantage of that match before allocating money to other accounts. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, contribute to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility. These accounts offer potential tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Balance Contributions**: Once you've met your goals for tax-advantaged accounts, consider how to distribute remaining funds between your 401(k) and taxable accounts based on your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and liquidity needs.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes when sold, while tax-advantaged accounts have different tax treatments.

Ultimately, itâ€™s best to tailor your strategy to your specific financial situation. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance.
