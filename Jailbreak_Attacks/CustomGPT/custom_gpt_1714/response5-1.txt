Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Consider maximizing your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Traditional or Roth IRA, aim to max out this account. The Roth offers tax-free growth, while a Traditional IRA may give you a tax deduction now.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out the tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - Balance contributions according to your current tax bracket. Higher earners might benefit more from traditional options to defer taxes.

### 4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Longer-term investments can typically go into the 401(k) or IRA, while shorter-term goals might be better served with taxable accounts due to easier access.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering asset allocation and risk tolerance.
