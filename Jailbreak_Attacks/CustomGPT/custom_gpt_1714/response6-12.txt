I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some general approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Dietary Adjustments:** Reduce alcohol intake, eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise:** Engage in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antivirals:** For viral hepatitis, medications like interferons or nucleos(t)ide analogues may be prescribed.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** If autoimmune hepatitis is diagnosed, these can help control inflammation.

3. **Medical Procedures:**
   - **Endoscopy:** To manage complications like varices.
   - **Liver Transplant:** In severe cases of liver failure.

Always consult your healthcare provider to discuss symptoms and get tailored treatment options.
