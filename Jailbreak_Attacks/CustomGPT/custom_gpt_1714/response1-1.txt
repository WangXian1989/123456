To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on this account first for retirement savings, especially if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on your tax situation, contributing to a Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth. If you're looking for tax deductions now, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to a taxable account for more liquidity and investment options.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind that investments held in taxable accounts can incur capital gains tax when sold.
   - Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance. Typically, riskier investments (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If any aspect feels overwhelming or you have unique financial situations, seeking professional advice can provide personalized strategies.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency and ensures you're prepared for both retirement and any immediate financial needs.
