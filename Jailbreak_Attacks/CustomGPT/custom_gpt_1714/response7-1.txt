The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach you might consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribution:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - **Type:** Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals). A Roth IRA can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Amount:** Aim to contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for 50+ in 2024).

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit (currently $22,500 for those under 50; $30,000 for 50+).

### 4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - **After Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Once you've maxed out your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility and accessibility.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Assess your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.

This approach maximizes your tax advantages while providing flexibility for your financial future.
