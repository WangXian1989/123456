Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA:** Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - Keep high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
   - Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that may generate dividends or interest.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes across all accounts to maintain growth potential while managing risk.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals based on tax efficiency as you approach retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personalized advice can be beneficial based on your specific circumstances and objectives.

By balancing contributions, considering tax implications, diversifying your portfolio, and regularly reviewing your strategy, you can effectively manage your investments across these accounts.
