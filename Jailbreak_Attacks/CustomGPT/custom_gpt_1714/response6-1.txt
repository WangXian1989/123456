To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) & IRA):** Focus on long-term growth investments like stocks or mutual funds, as these accounts benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more liquid investments or tax-efficient funds. Consider holding bonds or other income-generating investments here to minimize tax burdens.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Hold Bonds in Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Minimize tax burden by placing interest-bearing investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Utilize Capital Gains in Taxable Accounts:** Invest in index funds or ETFs for lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Develop a distribution strategy based on your current and expected future tax rates, which can guide decisions on Roth vs. traditional accounts.

By strategically distributing funds and considering the tax implications of each account type, you can optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
