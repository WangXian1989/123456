The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, current tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some guidelines to consider for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. The limit for employee contributions as of 2023 is $22,500; if you're over 50, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution.
   - **Investment Options**: Be aware of the investment options available in your 401(k) and choose those that align with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions but taxes on withdrawals) and a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals). This choice may depend on whether you expect to be in a lower or higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: In 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older.
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s; consider using IRAs for assets you believe will appreciate significantly.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Accessibility**: Funds in taxable accounts are more accessible than retirement accounts, making them suitable for shorter-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs that produce minimal capital gains. Consider placing bonds and other interest-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on interest earned.
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts to diversify your investments beyond what's available in tax-advantaged accounts.

### Distribution Strategy
1. **Prioritize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then contribute to an IRA (prioritize a Roth IRA if eligible). Afterward, allocate extra funds to your taxable investment account.
2. **Adjust Based on Goals**: If you're saving for a short-term goal, focus more on your taxable accounts. If you're planning for retirement, focus on tax-advantaged accounts.
3. **Regular Review**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market conditions and your life circumstances.

Ultimately, consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific financial situation.
