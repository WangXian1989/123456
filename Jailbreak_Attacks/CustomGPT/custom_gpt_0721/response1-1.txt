Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. It's essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Also tax-deductible in the contribution year, with taxes paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can access your money anytime without penalties. Consider the capital gains tax rates when investing in this account.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses) in a liquid account.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across accounts, depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Consider having more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and less aggressive ones in taxable accounts to manage capital gains tax effectively.

### 5. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Align your contributions with your short-term and long-term financial goals. If retirement is far off, you can be more aggressive. If you're nearing retirement, consider reallocating to safer investments.

### 6. **Regular Review & Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or retirement goals.

### Sample Allocation Strategy:
- Max out 401(k) up to the match.
- Consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if eligible.
- After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account for flexibility and access.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation and objectives.
