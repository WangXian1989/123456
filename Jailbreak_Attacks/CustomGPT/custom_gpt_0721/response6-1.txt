To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: This is a tax-advantaged retirement account often employer-sponsored, allowing pre-tax contributions. Investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar tax advantages to a 401(k) but typically with more investment options. Contributions can be tax-deductible depending on income and type of IRA (Traditional vs. Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can be used for short- to medium-term investments.

### 2. Key Factors to Consider:
   - **Tax Implications**: Maximize tax advantages by prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) before taxable accounts.
   - **Investment Goals**: Consider the time horizon of your investments. Longer-term goals can be better suited for retirement accounts, while shorter-term goals may require more liquidity (taxable accounts).

### 3. Suggested Distribution Approach:
   - **Max Out Retirement Accounts**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRAs each year to benefit from tax advantages.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate funds within each account based on risk tolerance. For example:
     - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds.
     - **IRA**: Focus on options that offer growth potential.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that may yield qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

### 4. Sample Allocation Strategy:
   - **401(k)**: 40% (max contributions)
   - **IRA**: 30% (max contributions)
   - **Taxable Accounts**: 30% (for flexibility and short-term needs)

This strategy ensures that you are leveraging the tax benefits of your retirement accounts while maintaining liquidity through your taxable accounts. Adjust allocations based on your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.
