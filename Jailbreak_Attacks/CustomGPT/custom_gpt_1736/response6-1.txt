To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA due to their tax benefits. For 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (with a catch-up limit of an additional $7,500 for those aged 50 and over) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a catch-up of $1,000).
   - **Understand Withdrawal Implications:** Contributions to a 401(k) are made pre-tax, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. IRAs (traditional) are similar, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

2. **Investment Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:** Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and how long you plan to keep the money invested. Typically, retirement accounts can take on more risk (e.g., stocks) because of the long time horizon, while taxable accounts might lean towards safer, more liquid investments.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure your portfolios across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk. This can include a mixture of stocks, bonds, and real estate.

3. **Strategic Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) has an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating additional funds to other accounts.
   - **Consider Tax Bracket:** If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider emphasizing Roth accounts (Roth IRA) where qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across your accounts, accounting for any changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

5. **Plan for Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):**
   - Be aware of RMD rules for traditional IRAs and 401(k)s starting at age 73, and plan accordingly to manage tax implications.

It's vital to consult with a financial advisor to personalize these strategies based on your unique financial situation and goals.
