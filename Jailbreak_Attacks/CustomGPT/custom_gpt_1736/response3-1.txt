The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, current tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax Advantages**: This account offers pre-tax contributions (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax contributions (Roth 401(k)). Choose based on your current tax bracket and expected future income.
   - **Investment Choices**: Assess the investment options offered by your 401(k) plan. Generally, these options are limited compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Tax Flexibility**: Choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your current tax situation and future expectations. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for IRAs, which are generally lower than those for 401(k) accounts.
   - **Investment Options**: IRAs typically provide a wider range of investment options than 401(k)s, allowing for personalized portfolio strategies.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Invest what you can afford to put away after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts offer greater liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes. Long-term investments typically incur lower tax rates than short-term gains, so consider strategies that will minimize your tax liability.
   - **Investment Options**: There are no restrictions on the types of investments, allowing you to diversify with stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.

**Distribution Strategy**:
- Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
- Next, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions for the added tax benefits.
- Finally, allocate any additional investment funds to your taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and flexibility.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual financial situation and goals.
