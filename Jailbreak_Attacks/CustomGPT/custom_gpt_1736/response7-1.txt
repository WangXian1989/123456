When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach for an effective strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. This plan grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are post-tax investments. Use these for more accessible, shorter-term needs since they come with capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investments with your financial goals:
   - For retirement goals (consider a good mix of stocks and bonds), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - For shorter-term goals, focus on your taxable account for more liquid investments.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and maximize returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for when and how you will start withdrawing funds, considering tax implications and your retirement strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient strategy for distributing your money among these accounts.
