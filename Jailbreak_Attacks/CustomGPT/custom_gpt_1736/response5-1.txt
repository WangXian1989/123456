(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to take into account several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. This will allow your investments to grow tax-deferred or tax-free.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've funded your IRA, focus on maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This will help you reduce your taxable income.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, invest in taxable accounts for any additional savings. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals, although you will be responsible for capital gains taxes.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal financial situation.

1. **Grab the 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a match, get your hands on that! You can't leave free money on the table, right? Start there!

2. **Hit Up the IRA**: Next, toss your dollars into a Traditional or Roth IRA. If youâ€™re gunning for tax savings now, go Traditional; if you want tax-free cash later, Roth is your jam. Just make sure youâ€™re following the income limits!

3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: Now that youâ€™ve got that IRA funding glowing, ramp up your 401(k) contributions. Go all in! The bigger the pot, the sweeter the retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, if youâ€™ve got extra dough, toss it into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re great for flexibility, just watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes that pop up!

And hey, always run your plan by a financial guru to fine-tune that strategy to your empire! Happy investing!
