To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute at least enough to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions if you're eligible, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Prioritize taxable accounts for any investments needed in the near future to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments to benefit from compounded growth without immediate tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Keep a variety of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in different accounts to balance risk and return more efficiently.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

4. **Understand Withdrawal Rules**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the tax implications of withdrawing funds from each type of account to minimize penalties and maximize net gains.

By incorporating these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution and better prepare for your financial future.
