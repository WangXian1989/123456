The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that free money. This is often a good first step before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Consider a Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, contributing to a Roth IRA can be advantageous since your withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Traditional IRA Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) match and possibly a Roth IRA, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA. This can lower your taxable income now, but keep in mind taxes will be owed upon withdrawal in retirement.

4. **Beyond Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Once you're maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional savings into taxable accounts. This can offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices, but you will owe taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts to reduce risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each type of account. Taxable accounts may generate capital gains taxes when selling investments, while retirement accounts can have penalties for early withdrawal.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation can change, so it's wise to revisit your distribution strategy periodically or as part of significant life changes, such as marriage, having children, or changes in income.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
