To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, aim to max out your IRA contributions, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it grows tax-free.

2. **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, assess how much you can contribute to your taxable account. This approach allows for flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Your risk tolerance and investment time frame should influence how you allocate funds among these accounts. Generally, long-term investments can be more aggressive, while short-term needs may require a more conservative approach.

4. **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Use your taxable account for investments that may generate income and thus be taxed annually.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across all accounts to spread risk and take advantage of different investment vehicles.

By following these steps, you can develop an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and maximizes tax efficiencies.
