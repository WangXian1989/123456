Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Contributions**:
   - In 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50) and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). Aim to maximize these if possible.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are good for flexibility but come with taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place investments that are expected to generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

5. **Rebalance and Diversify**:
   - Reassess your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. 

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies in a savings account before heavily investing.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances and goals.
