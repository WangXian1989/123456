The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing at least enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - Maximize contributions up to the annual limit if you can afford it, as contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for a Roth 401(k)), lowering your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - If youâ€™re eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation (traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - Consider the income limits for IRA contributions to ensure eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high short-term capital gains, which are taxed at your regular income tax rate.
   - Also, consider keeping investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in these accounts since they are typically taxed at lower rates.

4. **Investment Goals & Timeline**: 
   - For short-term goals, such as saving for a house, a taxable account might be appropriate since it offers more liquidity.
   - For long-term growth (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax deferral.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts and adjust your investments based on individual account tax implications (e.g., place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Given the complexity of tax laws and individual circumstances, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice that fits your specific situation.

Implementing a strategy that aligns with your longer-term financial goals while minimizing taxes over time will often yield the best outcomes.
