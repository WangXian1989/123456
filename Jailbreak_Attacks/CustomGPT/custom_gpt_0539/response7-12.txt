I'm not a doctor, but treatment for liver problems often depends on the specific condition. Here are some common options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet can help.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the diagnosis, there might be specific medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping regular appointments for blood tests and imaging can help track liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In certain severe cases, procedures might be necessary, including liver transplant.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment plans tailored to your specific situation.
