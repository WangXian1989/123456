Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a strategic approach you might consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, consider whether a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA is better for you. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA can lower your taxable income now.

### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that have favorable tax treatment, such as long-term capital gains on stocks held for over a year or municipal bonds.
- **Asset Location Strategy**: Place bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-deferred accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

### 3. Consider Liquidity Needs
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough cash in liquid accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses before locking up funds in retirement accounts.
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, useful for early retirement or unforeseen expenses.

### 4. Diversify Investments within Each Account
- **Risk Assessment**: Balance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance across all accounts, ensuring you’re not overly aggressive or conservative in any one account.

### 5. Regular Rebalancing
- **Review Annually**: At least once a year, review and adjust your allocations to stay on track with your long-term goals and changing market conditions.

This strategic distribution will help optimize your savings for both growth and tax efficiency while also ensuring that you have liquidity when needed.
