When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Taxes are deferred until withdrawal, usually in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The choice affects your current tax situation and future tax liabilities.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax in the year they are realized. Consider the impact of your investment strategy on your tax bill.

2. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - 401(k) and IRA accounts have annual contribution limits. Make sure to maximize employer matches in a 401(k) first since that’s essentially free money.

3. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. In contrast, 401(k) and IRAs have rules regarding early withdrawals.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Define your short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals due to their liquidity, while 401(k)s and IRAs can be focused on long-term growth.

5. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance to determine how aggressive or conservative your investment choices should be across these account types.

6. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider what types of investments (stocks, bonds, real estate) are best suited for each account type based on tax implications. For example, holding high-growth stocks in a tax-advantaged account might be beneficial to avoid paying capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
1. Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if there’s an employer match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth.
3. Invest remaining funds in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

### Regular Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your goals, tax situation, and market conditions.
