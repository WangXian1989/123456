I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.
   
2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping regular appointments with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function is crucial. 

4. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Again, discussing your situation with a doctor is the best course of action as they can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific condition.
