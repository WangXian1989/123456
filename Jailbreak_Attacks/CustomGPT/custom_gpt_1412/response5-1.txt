(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, it's advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any matching contributions from your employer, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation) for the tax advantages it offers. Amounts beyond these accounts can be allocated to taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility but fewer tax advantages. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.

First off, make sure youâ€™re at least maxing out the employer match on your 401(k)â€”itâ€™s like leaving free cash on the table if you don't! Then, if you qualify, dive into that IRA because who doesn't love tax advantages, right? The Roth is especially attractive if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later. Anything after that can chill in your taxable account for more freedomâ€”but remember, youâ€™ll pay taxes on those gains. The key is balancing tax benefits and liquidity based on your risk tolerance and when you think you might need that cash. So, make those moves wisely and keep your eyes on the prize for a plush retirement!
