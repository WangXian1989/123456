Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, strive to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation). IRAs can provide tax advantages that can boost your savings.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, continue to maximize your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This can provide significant tax-deferral benefits.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable investment account. This should be used for funds you may need before retirement (as these can be accessed without penalties). Taxable accounts offer flexibility but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risks.

6. **Review Tax Implications**: Understand that funds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) will be taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts provide tax-free withdrawals. Ensure you're managing your tax liabilities effectively.

7. **Adjust According to Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors might allocate more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may prefer a conservative approach to preserve capital.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

Remember, this is just a framework. Personal financial situations vary significantly, and it's crucial to evaluate your own needs and goals thoroughly.
