Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations and a general approach to help you decide:

1. **Understand the Account Types**:
    - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matching contributions and has higher annual contribution limits. Contributions may be pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
    - **IRA**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth) but has lower contribution limits compared to a 401(k).
    - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages but offer flexibility in withdrawals and investment choices.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, it's usually best to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
    - **Tax Bracket**: In lower tax brackets, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. In higher brackets, a traditional IRA or 401(k) may provide immediate tax benefits.
    - **Withdrawals**: Understand how withdrawals will be taxed from each account type during retirement.

4. **Diversification**:
    - Use your 401(k) for long-term investment strategies and consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.
    - IRAs can also be diversified similarly but may have unique investment options.
    - Taxable accounts can be great for more liquid investments, such as stocks or bonds, especially if you might need access to funds before retirement.

5. **Investment Goals**:
    - If youâ€™re closer to retirement, prioritize stability and capital preservation in your 401(k) and IRA.
    - For long-term growth, consider aggressive investments in your taxable account, since capital gains may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Regular Review**: Revisit your distribution strategy periodically or as your financial situation changes (e.g., changes in income, expenses, or tax laws).

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique circumstances and goals.

A potential distribution strategy might look like the following:
- Max out your 401(k) contributions to at least the employer match.
- Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify and have room in your budget.
- Allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account for flexibility and diversification.

It's essential to tailor your strategy to fit your specific financial situation and retirement goals.
