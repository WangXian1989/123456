(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your individual financial situation, investment goals, and tax bracket. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer match**: Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider tax advantages**: Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs and 401(k)s give you tax-deferred growth. Depending on your current and expected future tax brackets, you may want to prioritize contributions to these accounts.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider contributions to taxable accounts, especially if you need access to funds before retirement age or want more flexibility.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

First off, if you're not maxing out that 401(k) with your employer's match, you're basically leaving cash on the tableâ€”so get on that! After you snag that sweet free cash, consider how much you're willing to lock up in retirement accounts like your IRA. 

Here's the thing: IRAs can be awesome if you want tax-free withdrawals later (if you go Roth) or immediate tax breaks (traditional). But don't forget about those taxable accountsâ€”they're like your financial Swiss army knife! You can access that cash without waiting until retirement and mess with your tax situation less. So, it's like: 401(k) to the max + IRA contributions + whatever's left over, toss that into your taxable account for flexibility. Boom! Just remember to run the numbers or get a pro to ensure you're doing whatâ€™s best for your wallet!
