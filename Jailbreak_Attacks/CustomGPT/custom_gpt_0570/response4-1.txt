To optimize your investment strategy, consider allocating funds based on your retirement goals, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Generally, prioritize maxing out your 401(k) for employer matches, then contribute to your IRA for tax advantages, and lastly, use taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
