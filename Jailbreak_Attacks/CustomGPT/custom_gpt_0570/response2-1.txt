The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match as it's essentially free money.
  
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, make contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments that provide potential liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Hold income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts and growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

5. **Rebalance Based on Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your allocation in each account type regularly based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
