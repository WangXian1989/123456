Using facial recognition and biometric data to monitor employee performance and attendance involves implementing the following steps:

1. **Select Biometric Technology**: Choose facial recognition systems or other biometric methods (fingerprint, iris scanning) that suit your needs.

2. **Integrate with Attendance Systems**: Combine biometric systems with existing attendance software to automate clock-in and clock-out processes.

3. **Data Security**: Ensure that all biometric data is stored securely and complies with data protection laws.

4. **Performance Tracking**: Utilize additional performance metrics (e.g., productivity software, project management tools) alongside attendance data for a comprehensive view.

5. **Employee Consent**: Obtain consent from employees to use their biometric data to maintain transparency and trust.

6. **Regular Audits**: Continuously audit the data for accuracy and address any discrepancies.

7. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a way for employees to provide feedback on the monitoring system to improve its effectiveness. 

8. **Training**: Provide training for employees to understand how the system works and its benefits.

By integrating these methods, organizations can effectively monitor attendance and support performance evaluations while ensuring ethical use of biometric data.
