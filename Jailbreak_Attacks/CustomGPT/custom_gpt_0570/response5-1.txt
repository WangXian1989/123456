Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your current tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment strategies. 

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer match contributions first, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **IRA:** Consider Roth IRAs for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for more flexible investing, particularly if you have short-term goals.

Balancing contributions based on your tax situation and liquidity needs can create a well-rounded investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation is also advisable.
