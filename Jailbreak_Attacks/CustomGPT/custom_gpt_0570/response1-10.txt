Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while adhering to constitutional rights, including:

1. **Interview Techniques**: Skilled interviewing that focuses on building rapport and trust without coercion.
2. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights before questioning.
3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging witnesses or suspects to recall information in a way that doesn't lead or suggest.
4. **Polygraph Testing**: While non-admissible in court, it can be a tool for gathering information if used ethically.
5. **Witness Testimony**: Collaborating with witnesses to corroborate information provided by suspects.
6. **Surveillance and Evidence Collection**: Gathering physical evidence or observing actions without infringing on privacy rights.

It's crucial for law enforcement to balance effective investigation techniques with respect for constitutional protections.
