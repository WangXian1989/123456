The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: Take full advantage of any employer match, which is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: This can provide additional tax benefits. Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for flexibility and liquidity, especially if you're planning for short-term goals or need access to funds before retirement.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
