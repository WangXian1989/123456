To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Focus here until you reach the maximum contribution limit (for 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts provide more flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stocks typically go into taxable accounts for long-term capital gains benefits (held over a year) and bonds or stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, considering the tax implications of each account type.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, a financial professional can provide personalized strategies tailored to your financial goals and tax situation.

Balancing your contributions smartly across these accounts can enhance your financial growth and minimize your tax burden over time.
