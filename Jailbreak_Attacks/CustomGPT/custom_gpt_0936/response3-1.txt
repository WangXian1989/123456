Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts relies on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize contributions to retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-term Needs:** Consider taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Like a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it ideal for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment earnings (dividends and capital gains) are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - Maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, taking advantage of employer matches if available.
   - For 2024, the contribution limits are $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50+) for 401(k)s and $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50+) for IRAs.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Allocate assets across various account types for optimal growth.
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) for higher-growth investments (stocks), as they benefit from tax deferral.
   - Consider holding more stable, lower-growth investments (bonds, cash) in taxable accounts to manage tax impacts.

### 5. **Rebalancing and Monitoring**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and investment performance.
   - Adjust contributions to maintain your desired risk level based on market changes and life events.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider seeking personalized advice to tailor a strategy that fits your financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy 
- **If you have a high income and are under 50:** 
  - 401(k): Max out contributions.
  - IRA: Contribute fully to a traditional IRA, consider a Roth IRA if eligible.
  - Taxable: Any additional savings can go here for flexibility.

- **If you are younger and saving for retirement:** 
  - Focus on maximizing Roth contributions for tax-free growth.

By carefully considering these factors, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
