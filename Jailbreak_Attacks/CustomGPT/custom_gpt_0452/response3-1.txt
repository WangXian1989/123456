Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Maximize contributions to these accounts since they often offer greater tax benefits.
   - Assess whether a traditional or Roth IRA is best for you based on your current tax bracket and expected tax situation in retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide flexibility, as funds can be withdrawn without penalties.
   - Use tax-efficient investment strategies, such as investing in index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, stocks are better suited for long-term growth within tax-advantaged accounts due to their potential for higher returns (and the associated tax implications on gains).

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a liquid account before investing substantial amounts in retirement accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution strategies to ensure they align with your financial goals and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, financial objectives, and market conditions.
