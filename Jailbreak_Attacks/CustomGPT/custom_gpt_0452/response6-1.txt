To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Max out employer match**: Start with your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to IRAs**: After maxing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to IRAs (both traditional and Roth), depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

### 2. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) & IRA)**: Focus on growth investments (stocks) here, as taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax implications.

### 3. **Rebalancing Regularly**
   - Keep track of your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Withdrawals**: Be aware of tax impacts for each account type during withdrawals in retirement. Prioritize withdrawals from taxable accounts first for tax efficiency.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment distribution based on your financial goals and tax situation.
