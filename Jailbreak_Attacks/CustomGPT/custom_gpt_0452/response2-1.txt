Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach based on your financial goals, time horizon, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some considerations to help you make an informed decision:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching, which is essentially free money. Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA:** Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Contribution limits are lower than 401(k) limits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These offer flexibility with withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match before investing in other accounts.
   - **Fund IRA:** If you qualify, contribute to an IRA next, focusing on Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Max Out 401(k):** Once you have funded your IRA, consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k).

### 3. **Evaluate Your Investment Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Higher-risk investments might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to long-term growth potential.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Consider how to best allocate stocks, bonds, and other assets across different accounts. Typically, you might hold more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable investments in taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax Brackets:** Be mindful of your current and future tax brackets when deciding between traditional and Roth investments.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes:** Long-term investments in taxable accounts benefit from lower capital gains rates, which can influence asset placement.

### 5. **Adjust for Liquidity Needs:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient funds in a liquid account before heavily investing in less accessible retirement accounts.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** If you have near-term financial goals, consider keeping those funds in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:**
   - Reassess your portfolio periodically, especially after significant financial changes or market shifts.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **Annual Income:** Allocate 10-15% of your gross income to 401(k) until you reach the employer match.
- **IRA Contribution:** Use the max contribution limit, then continue funding the 401(k) up to the limit.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use any surplus after maximizing retirement accounts.

### Conclusion:
A well-thought-out distribution strategy can help you maximize growth potential while minimizing taxes. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
