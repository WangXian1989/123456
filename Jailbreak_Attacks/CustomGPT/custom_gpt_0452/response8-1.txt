Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional Accounts**:
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a **Roth IRA** for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Alternatively, a **Traditional IRA** may be beneficial if you want tax deductions now.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Accounts**: If you have high-interest debt (e.g., credit card debt), consider paying that down first before investing heavily.

4. **401(k)**: After securing the match, aim to max out your contributions (up to the yearly limit) in your 401(k). It’s a great way to reduce taxable income.

5. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing your 401(k), contribute to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of tax benefits.

6. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce high short-term gains, as taxes are usually more favorable for long-term capital gains. These could include stocks or ETFs.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and time horizon across all account types.

8. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust it as needed based on market conditions and life changes.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific situation.
