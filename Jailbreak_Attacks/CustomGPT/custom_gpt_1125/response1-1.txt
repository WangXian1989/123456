Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts don’t offer tax advantages like 401(k)s and IRAs but provide more flexibility. They’re ideal for short-term goals or if you might need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified. This can help mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Long-term Focus**: Consider your long-term goals and time horizon. Generally, the longer you can leave your money invested, the more it can grow.

It's often wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation.
