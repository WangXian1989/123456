To determine the best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax. It's great for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits for traditional IRAs (pre-tax), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Taxes are paid on capital gains and dividends. 

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure youâ€™re maximizing contributions to employer-sponsored plans (401(k)) for potential employer matches.
   - Be aware of IRA contribution limits and eligibility for tax deductions.

3. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align each account based on your financial goals (e.g., short-term vs. long-term).
   - Consider risk tolerance and time horizon for investments.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs since 401(k) and IRA funds typically have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations based on market conditions and life changes.

A balanced approach, focusing on tax efficiency and your specific financial situation, will help optimize your investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance.
