The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - After the match, consider funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional) since these offer tax benefits. If you can, contribute to both accounts within IRS limits.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income upfront, while Roth accounts provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings to taxable accounts. This gives you more access to your funds without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: 
   - Within all accounts, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: 
   - Regularly review your distribution strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and investment opportunities change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
