Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) next. This can provide tax advantages that a taxable account doesn’t.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred; you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Tax treatment varies (traditional vs. Roth). Consider your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You’ll owe taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains, so be mindful of your investment choices here.

4. **Prioritize Emergency Savings**: Before allocating large sums, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Diversification**: Allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to reduce risk.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on performance and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
