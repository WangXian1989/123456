Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are key considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Benefits**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer match.
   - **Strategy**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match. If youâ€™re approaching retirement, consider shifting more into conservative investments.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred growth; taxes paid on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free (if rules are met).
   - **Strategy**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize a Roth IRA. Otherwise, use a Traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Benefits**: Flexible access; no contribution limits.
   - **Strategy**: Use for short-term goals or to invest in assets that can be more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs). Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

### **General Allocation Tips**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings before heavily investing.
- **Age-Based Strategies**: Younger investors might lean more towards equities, while those closer to retirement should prioritize safer investments.
- **Diversification**: Across all accounts, diversify your investments to mitigate risk.

### **Conclusion**
- Start with maximizing your 401(k) match, then consider IRAs based on your tax situation, and finally use taxable accounts for additional savings and investments. Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.
