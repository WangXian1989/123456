Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as it reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it's beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) or traditional IRA) to lower your taxable income.
   - In a lower tax bracket, contributing to Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)) can be advantageous.

3. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility and quicker access to funds without penalties, useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a mix of assets (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider your overall asset allocation in all accounts collectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Align investments with your financial objectives. Use 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, while taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, helping to optimize your strategy.

By balancing these considerations, you can create an effective investment strategy tailored to your financial objectives.
