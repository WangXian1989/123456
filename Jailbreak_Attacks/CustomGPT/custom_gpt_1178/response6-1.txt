To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Place higher growth or risk assets (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower taxable income, like municipal bonds, or holdings you plan to sell in the near term to avoid capital gains.

### 3. **Account Type Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute up to the limit if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing 401(k) contributions, contribute to an IRA depending on your tax situation (Roth for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate extra funds here for flexibility and immediate access.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy across all accounts, maintaining a diverse asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically review your distribution and reallocate as needed based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Key Takeaways
- **Prioritize employer contributions.**
- **Choose asset types wisely for tax efficiency.**
- **Balance investments across accounts for growth and liquidity.**

Implementing these strategies can help maximize your retirement savings and achieve your financial goals effectively.
