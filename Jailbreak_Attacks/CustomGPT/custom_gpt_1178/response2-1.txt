To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Maximize your contributions to either, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contributions to traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) reduce your taxable income now but are taxed upon withdrawal. Roth accounts have no upfront tax benefit but offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate when deciding where to allocate funds.

3. **Diversify Account Types**:
   - Maintain a mix of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts to provide withdrawal flexibility in retirement, especially to manage tax implications over time.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Invest for growth in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) since these can compound without annual taxes. 
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burden.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid withdrawing from retirement accounts prematurely.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your investment strategy and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

By strategically distributing funds and taking advantage of tax benefits, you can enhance your long-term financial growth. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
