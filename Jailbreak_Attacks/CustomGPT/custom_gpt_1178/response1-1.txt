Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, tax situation, and financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you qualify for a tax-deductible IRA, consider contributing to this next, especially if you want tax-deferred growth.

3. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-advantaged accounts** (401(k) and IRA) are preferable for long-term investments to grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Taxable accounts** can be beneficial for short-term goals since you can access funds without penalties, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth, high-volatility investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like municipal bonds or broad market ETFs.

5. **Consider Your Future Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be beneficial for the tax-free withdrawals.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a balanced portfolio among different asset classes to spread risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

It's often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
