To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce taxable income if a traditional 401(k) is used. Consider maxing out contributions if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: Choose a Traditional IRA if you want immediate tax benefits; choose a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits. If you're eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider tax-efficient investments such as index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds) to manage risk.
- **Time Horizon**: Align your investment choices with your time horizon. Longer-term investments can take on more risk.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies outside your retirement accounts.

### Summary:
1. Max out 401(k) contributions, especially to receive any employer match.
2. Contribute to an IRA based on your tax situation and goals.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional savings and investing flexibility.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal circumstances.
