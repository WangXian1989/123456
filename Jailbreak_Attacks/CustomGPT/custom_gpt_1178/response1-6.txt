2. **Focus on Issues**: Highlight issues that resonate with young people, such as climate change, student debt, and social justice.

3. **Leverage Influencers**: Collaborate with relatable influencers to boost credibility and reach.

4. **Interactive Campaigns**: Create engaging, interactive experiences, such as polls and quizzes, to involve young voters.

5. **Community Outreach**: Organize events in local areas, including concerts or volunteer opportunities focused on relevant causes.

6. **Mobile Engagement**: Use text messaging and apps for direct communication, as younger voters prefer mobile-friendly options.
