Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider for effective distribution:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**  
   If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be prioritized.

2. **Take Advantage of Tax-Deferred Accounts:**  
   Contribute to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, as these allow your investments to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal, potentially leading to greater long-term growth compared to taxable accounts.

3. **Consider Roth Accounts:**  
   If you have a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), consider making contributions there as well. Since withdrawals from Roth accounts in retirement are tax-free (given certain conditions), they can be advantageous for long-term tax planning.

4. **Balance Taxable Accounts:**  
   Allocate any remaining funds into taxable accounts, especially if you anticipate needing access to these funds before retirement. Taxable accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals but come with capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Investment Strategy:**  
   Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts but tailor your investments to the tax implications. For example, consider holding more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and more tax-efficient assets (like index funds or qualified dividends) in taxable accounts.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:**  
   As you near retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes. This often involves withdrawing from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally leveraging tax-free withdrawals from Roth accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**  
   Every individual's financial situation is unique. A financial advisor can help tailor a distribution plan based on your personal financial landscape, goals, and tax situation.

Regularly review your asset allocation and contribution levels to ensure that they align with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
