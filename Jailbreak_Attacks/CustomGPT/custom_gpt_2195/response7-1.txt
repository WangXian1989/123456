The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Beyond that, evaluate the investment options within your 401(k) for growth potential and fees.

2. **IRAs**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which may suit you if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement. Maximize your IRA contributions after reaching your employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are ideal for funds you may need before retirement or for short-term goals. Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider the tax implications of selling investments within this account.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Annual Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs, and adjust your distributions accordingly to make the most of tax-advantaged accounts before funding taxable accounts.

6. **Financial Goals**: Regularly review and adjust your investment strategy based on changing life circumstances, goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your situation. 

Ultimately, maintaining a balanced approach among these accounts while focusing on your long-term financial objectives is crucial.
