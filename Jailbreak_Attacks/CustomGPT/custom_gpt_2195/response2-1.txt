The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment strategy, and time horizon. Here are some considerations to help guide your distribution:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each type of account has different contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) plans (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those aged 50 and older) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and older). Maximize contributions to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals during retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and like a 401(k), withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. 
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free, making it a great option for tax diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider placing investments expected to appreciate at a higher rate in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) or have high growth potential (like stocks), as these accounts shelter investments from immediate taxation.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income tax.

4. **Time Horizon**: 
   - If you're investing for long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriateâ€”though any investments intended for the short term should be invested conservatively.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy remains diversified across different asset classes regardless of the type of account.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on your investment performance and changing financial circumstances.

It can be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored investment strategy that aligns with your overall financial situation and goals.
