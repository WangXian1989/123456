Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - **IRA:** After contributing to your 401(k), consider opening or contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either Traditional or Roth. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. You'll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, meaning you pay taxes now, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Unlike retirement accounts, you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains in the year they are realized.

3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals:** If you're saving for retirement, it might make sense to keep more of your investments in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, like buying a house or starting a business, a taxable account may be more appropriate.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Consider how you allocate different types of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) amongst these accounts based on their tax treatment and your overall risk tolerance. Typically, higher growth investments (like stocks) can be more tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to potentially earn tax-free growth.

4. **Rebalancing and Adjustments:**
   - Regularly review your investment distribution and adjust according to changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

5. **Consulting a Financial Advisor:**
   - It's often beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that meets your unique circumstances, particularly for tax implications and estate planning considerations.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and being mindful of your overall financial strategy, you can effectively distribute your money across these different accounts. Always keep in mind your long-term financial goals and how each account type can help you achieve them.
