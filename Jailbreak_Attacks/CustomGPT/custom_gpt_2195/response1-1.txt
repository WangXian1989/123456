The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax breaks that can enhance your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Use these for short-term goals where tax implications matter less.

4. **Diversification of Investments:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to mitigate risk. This includes having a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to minimize taxes. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-advantaged accounts as needed.

6. **Adjust for Age and Goals:** Younger investors might favor aggressive growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more conservative allocations.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances is also advisable.
