Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are the key considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your employer's plan, especially if they offer a match. This reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred.
  
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you'll need access to before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

Balance your contributions based on immediate needs, long-term goals, and tax implications to maximize your overall returns. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.
