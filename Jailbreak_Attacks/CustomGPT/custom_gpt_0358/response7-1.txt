To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out contributions here as well for tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Allocate more to taxable accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement or if you need flexibility with withdrawals.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient ones (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Keep enough liquidity in taxable accounts to cover emergencies without tapping into retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and goals. Short-term goals (less than five years) might be better suited for safer investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and market conditions.

Itâ€™s always wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.
