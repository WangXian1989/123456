To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions here as well, especially if it's a Roth IRA, allowing for tax-free growth.

2. **Investment Options**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Often, employer plans have limited options, so select the best performing funds available.
   - **IRA**: Use a broader range of investment options. Focus on low-cost index funds or ETFs for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider investments that are tax-efficient, like ETFs or municipal bonds, reducing your taxable income.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on assets with high growth potential since you’ll eventually pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in assets that can be more tax-efficient to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are well-diversified to reduce risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments in accounts you won’t tap into for many years, while being more conservative in funds needed sooner.
