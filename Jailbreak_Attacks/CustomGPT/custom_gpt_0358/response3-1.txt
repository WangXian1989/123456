Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, taking advantage of tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and access.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments based on risk tolerance. Generally, stocks can be held in taxable accounts for better after-tax returns, while bonds may fit well in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:** Adjust allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor is also a great way to tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation.
