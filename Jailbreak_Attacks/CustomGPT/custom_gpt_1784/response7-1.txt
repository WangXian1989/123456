The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Traditional 401(k) and IRA contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts are funded with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments, so consider placing higher-growth investments in taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon should also influence your asset allocation. Younger individuals might prefer more aggressive investments (stocks) in their retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement may focus on less risky investments (bonds, cash).

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Ensure you are diversifying your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. This may mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments in each type of account.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your accounts grow and markets fluctuate, itâ€™s important to rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.
