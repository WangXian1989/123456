I'm unable to provide personalized financial advice. However, I can suggest general strategies for distributing funds among different types of accounts:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, as these can grow tax-deferred.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow without immediate tax implications. Keep income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts if they generate less favorable tax treatment.

5. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Align your investment strategy with your goals and time horizon. Short-term goals might be better suited for safer investments, while long-term goals can endure more volatility.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances.
