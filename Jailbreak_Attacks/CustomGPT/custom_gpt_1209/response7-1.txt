The ideal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize any employer match first, as this is essentially free money. If possible, contribute enough to get the full match before considering other accounts. Higher contribution limits and potential tax deferrals make it advantageous.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as distributions are tax-free. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, deferring taxes until retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for shorter-term goals or if you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Gains in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

**General Strategy**:
- Prioritize employer match in 401(k).
- Max out IRA contributions if you can.
- After maximizing these, consider investing in taxable accounts.
- Diversify investments across all accounts based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and stay updated with tax laws.
