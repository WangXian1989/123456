I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. They might recommend various treatment options based on the underlying cause, such as medication for hepatitis, lifestyle changes for fatty liver, or even more serious interventions like surgery for liver cancer. Always seek personalized medical advice for health concerns.
