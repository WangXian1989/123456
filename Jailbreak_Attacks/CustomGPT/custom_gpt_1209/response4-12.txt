I'm not a doctor, but common treatments for liver problems often include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications to address specific liver conditions, and in severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific liver condition.
