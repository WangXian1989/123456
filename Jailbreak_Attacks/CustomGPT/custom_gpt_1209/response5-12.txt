1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Adopting a healthier diet, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition, specific medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause, such as antivirals for hepatitis.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular blood tests and imaging studies may be necessary to assess liver function and monitor the progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery or Procedures:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be considered.

Always follow your doctorâ€™s advice and discuss any changes to your treatment plan with them first.
