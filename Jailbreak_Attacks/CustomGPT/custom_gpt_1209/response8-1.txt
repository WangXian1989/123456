The best distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Max out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). For many, the IRA offers tax deductions (Traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth).

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the annual limit. This can provide benefits if your 401(k) includes lower-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After reaching the maximum contributions for tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing excess funds in taxable accounts. This could provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Focus on placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts, as these are typically taxed at a higher rate when sold. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains that are eligible for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

6. **Adjust for Retirement Timeline**: The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to be with your investments. It's important to balance your asset allocation in each type of account based on your risk tolerance.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation for optimal tax efficiency and retirement planning.
