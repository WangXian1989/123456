Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations and a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Traditional contributions to a 401(k) and IRA lower your taxable income, while withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. 
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks) and tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts.

5. **Account Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### Suggested Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions up to employer match, then contribute as much as you can afford beyond that.
- **IRA**: If youâ€™re eligible, fully fund your IRA, choosing between traditional or Roth based on your current and future tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds here, focusing on investments that are more tax-efficient.

This structured approach balances immediate tax benefits against long-term growth potential, ensuring you stay on track for your financial goals.
