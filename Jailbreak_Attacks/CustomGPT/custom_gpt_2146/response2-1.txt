Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify for tax deductions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000, and the IRA limit is $6,500 (with a catch-up option for those 50+).

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts don’t have those benefits but allow for more flexibility and access.

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure each account type has a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 

6. **Consider Withdrawals**:
   - Plan for when you might need to access funds. Taxable accounts allow for easier withdrawals without penalties, while 401(k)s and IRAs have age limits and potential penalties.

7. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts when you're in a higher tax bracket. In lower brackets, particularly for Roth accounts, tax-free growth may be more beneficial.

8. **Yearly Review**:
   - Regularly reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual situation.
