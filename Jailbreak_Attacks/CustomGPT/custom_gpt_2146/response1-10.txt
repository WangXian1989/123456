Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Rapport Building**: Establishing a connection to encourage cooperation.
   - **Cognitive Interviewing**: Allowing the suspect to recall events without leading questions.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Ensuring suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

3. **Voluntary Confessions**:
   - Encouraging suspects to share information freely, without coercion or pressure.

4. **Forensic Evidence**:
   - Using physical evidence, like DNA or fingerprints, to corroborate or contradict a suspectâ€™s statements.

5. **Witness Testimonies**:
   - Gathering information from witnesses to build a case and confront the suspect with inconsistencies.

These methods prioritize legality and ethics while striving for effective information gathering.
