Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts** (401(k) and Traditional IRA): Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-free Accounts** (Roth IRA): Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Good if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or to manage tax implications of investments.

### 3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After meeting your employer’s match, prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible. If you’ve maxed that out, return to the 401(k) or consider taxable accounts.
   - Assess the contribution limits: For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with catch-up contributions possible if you’re over 50).

### 4. **Investment Choices**:
   - Diversify investments within each account type. Consider the overall balance of stocks, bonds, and other assets to mitigate risk based on your timeline and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Withdrawals and Timing**:
   - Plan for retirement withdrawals by considering which accounts to draw from first, often starting with taxable to minimize tax implications.

### 6. **Regular Review**:
   - Revisit your distribution strategy regularly, especially as your income, expenses, and market conditions change.

### Conclusion:
Creating a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation is key. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance specific to your situation.
