Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider IRA Contributions**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

### 3. **Tax-Efficient Investment in Taxable Accounts**
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) within taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Prioritize Based on Tax Brackets**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth. In higher brackets, focus on Traditional IRAs or 401(k)s for immediate tax benefits.

### 5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk and align with your risk tolerance.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can be tax-efficient, followed by tax-deferred accounts.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: Max out to the employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds, focusing on long-term growth.

### Conclusion
Always tailor your strategy based on personal circumstances and consider consulting a financial advisor for a plan that suits your goals.
