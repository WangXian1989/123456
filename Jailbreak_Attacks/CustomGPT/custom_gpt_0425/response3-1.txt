Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and no contribution limits.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially “free money.”
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, especially if you want tax-free growth (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional investments or short-term goals, as they offer more flexibility.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Goals:** Consider your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Generally, higher-risk assets (like stocks) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) can go into taxable accounts to minimize taxes on gains.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Hold tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts, and keep higher-turnover strategies or bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your portfolio and rebalance to maintain your desired allocation. This prevents overexposure to a single asset class and helps manage risk.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation, helping you optimize your retirement savings.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals:**
   - Plan your future withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. For example, consider drawing from taxable accounts first in retirement to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, aligning with your retirement goals and tax considerations.
