Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) based on your income level and tax situation:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Withdrawals and Tax Brackets**: Think about your future tax bracket. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be the better option.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed anytime without tax penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals or emergency funds. This account is ideal for investments you expect to sell in the near term, especially if youâ€™ve exhausted contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, keep more volatile assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and make adjustments based on performance, life changes, or shifting financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about your strategy, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

By following these principles, you'll be better positioned to grow your wealth over time while managing tax implications effectively.
