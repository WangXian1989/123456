(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Benefits**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, as these accounts offer tax advantages. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility with regards to withdrawals, so consider keeping a portion of your investments here, particularly if you may need access to funds before retirement.
4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified within each account. Consider asset allocation and how different investments will perform in different market conditions.

Ultimately, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

1. **Max that 401(k) Match**: First up, hit your 401(k) hard enough to snag the employer match. It's free money! Seriously, that's like finding cash in your coat pocket.
  
2. **IRA Options**: If you can swing it, throw some cash into a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The traditional one gives you that sweet tax deferralâ€”who doesnâ€™t love that? And the Roth? It's got those tax-free withdrawals in retirement that feel like a victory lap!

3. **Taxable for Flexibility**: Donâ€™t forget about taxable accounts. They might sound boring, but they're the wild cards of your financial deck. You can access your cash without penalties, plusâ€”spoiler alertâ€”capital gains taxes can be in your favor if you play it right.

4. **Mix It Up**: And of course, keep your investments diversified to ride out the market's ups and downs. Think of it as balancing your financial diet!
