Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income level and tax preferences. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth on withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Balance Contributions**
   - Once you meet the employer match in your 401(k) and contribute to an IRA, you can consider additional contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers lower fees and a good range of investment options.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you’ve reached the contribution limits of your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you’re in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement, contributing to a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be beneficial. Conversely, a Roth IRA may be better if you anticipate a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be beneficial for short-term needs or goals.

### 5. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Consider where to place different types of investments:
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Prefer investments with lower turnover to minimize capital gains taxes (like index funds).
     - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place high-growth or income-generating investments (like REITs or bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or retirement timeline.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Tailoring your strategy to your specific circumstances with a professional can provide personalized insights and help optimize your investment allocations.

Always assess your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance when deciding how to allocate your investments across different accounts.
