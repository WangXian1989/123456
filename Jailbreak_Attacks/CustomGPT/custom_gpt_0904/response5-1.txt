Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match as it’s essentially "free money." Consider maximizing contributions, especially if you're in your peak earning years.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After taking advantage of your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A traditional IRA can provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals. They allow for withdrawals without penalties, though you’ll pay capital gains tax on any profits. 

### Strategy:
- **Maximize 401(k) match** → Contribute to IRA → Invest in taxable accounts.
- **Balance risk**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for more volatile investments and safer, income-generating assets in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

### Regular Review:
Adjust contributions based on performance and changing financial goals, and consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
