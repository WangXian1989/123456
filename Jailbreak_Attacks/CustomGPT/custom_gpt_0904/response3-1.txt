Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer-Matched Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great return on investment.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) & IRA:** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Consider contributing here if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts offer flexibility but don't have the same tax advantages. Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they occur.

### 3. **Diversify Your Investments:**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon:
     - **Stocks:** Better for long-term growth.
     - **Bonds:** Typically safer, suitable for lower risk tolerance.

### 4. **Factor in Your Timeline:**
   - If you’re decades away from retirement, a higher allocation in growth-oriented assets (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA may be appropriate.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards less volatile investments.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Plan:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, then 10-15% of your salary.
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional depending on your tax situation):** Maximize contributions (currently $6,500, $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Accounts:** Any additional funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**
   - Individual circumstances can greatly influence the best strategy for you. A tailored plan can help optimize your distribution strategy.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions across these accounts depends on your situation, so regularly reassessing your allocations based on your goals and financial landscape is key.
