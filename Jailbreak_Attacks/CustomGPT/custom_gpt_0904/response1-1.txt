Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Contribute to Employer Match**: Max out your contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to this if you have a good employer match. Traditional 401(k)s offer tax benefits now, while Roth 401(k)s provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might want to contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts can offer flexibility and access to your funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Balance risk and growth according to your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks in stock assets, while those closer to retirement may want to shift towards more stable investments.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can help tailor a strategy specific to your situation, especially regarding withdrawals and the tax implications.

Regularly review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation or goals change.
