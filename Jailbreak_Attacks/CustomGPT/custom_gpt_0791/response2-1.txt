Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to help you decide on the best allocation:

### 1. Understand Each Account Type
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with tax-deferred growth. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, and many employers offer matching contributions.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account offering tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions (tax-deferred), while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts where you pay taxes on earnings, but you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties.

### 2. Consider Contribution Limits
- **401(k)**: For 2024, the limit is $23,000 (additional catch-up contributions for those 50 and older).
- **IRA**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 with a catch-up contribution of $1,000 for those 50 and older.
- These limits impact how much you can save in each account.

### 3. Assess Your Tax Situation
- Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, especially if you receive a company match in your 401(k).
- Consider your current and expected future tax rates. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth accounts (Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).

### 4. Create a Diversified Investment Strategy
- Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
- Generally, consider more aggressive growth investments in accounts with longer time horizons (like retirement accounts) and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

### 5. Allocation Strategy
- **Prioritize contributions**: Max out employer-match contributions in your 401(k) before moving on to IRAs.
- After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts.
- If you have surplus funds, consider using a tax-efficient investment strategy, like investing in index funds or tax-managed funds in your taxable account to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. Rebalance Regularly
- Periodically review your allocations and adjust as necessary to ensure alignment with your financial goals and changing circumstances.

### Summary
1. Prioritize 401(k) (especially for employer match) and IRA contributions for tax advantages.
2. Maximize contributions within annual limits when possible.
3. Maintain a diversified investment approach across all accounts.
4. Review and adjust your strategy regularly.
