Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. Understand Account Types
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer match; tax-advantaged for retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Tax benefits vary; Roth allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages; subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
   - **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is free money.
   - **Focus on IRA**: Depending on your income, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for flexible investments, especially if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income like index funds or stocks held long-term to benefit from lower capital gains tax.

### 4. Flexibility and Accessibility
   - Maintain a portion in taxable accounts for liquidity needs, emergencies, or short-term goals.

### 5. Regularly Review and Rebalance
   - Adjust your strategy based on changes in tax laws, personal circumstances, and market performance.

### Conclusion
Evaluating and distributing your investments wisely among these accounts can enhance your long-term savings and minimize taxes. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.
