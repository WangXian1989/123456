Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you're able to.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k)/IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Good for those expecting higher income in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Investment Time Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals (buying a house), a taxable account may be more suitable.
  
### 4. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) in your taxable account to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - Place high-growth or higher-yield investments within tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains.

### 5. **Maintain an Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings outside of these accounts for unexpected expenses. Typically, three to six months’ worth of expenses is recommended.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts. Rebalance regularly to maintain your desired risk level based on market changes and your financial situation.

### 7. **Seek Professional Guidance**
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, especially for complex tax strategies.

By taking these steps, you can create a comprehensive strategy that benefits your long-term financial health.
