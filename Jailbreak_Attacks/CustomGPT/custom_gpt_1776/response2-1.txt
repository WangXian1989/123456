To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, since this is essentially free money. The investment grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments also grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Great for long-term growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility. Consider this for short- to medium-term goals or for funds you might need sooner.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments with high growth potential (like stocks) to maximize tax-deferral benefits.
   - Consider fixed income or bond investments in taxable accounts, as they often produce taxable income.
   - Place dividend-paying stocks in retirement accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Adjust your asset allocation depending on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Prioritize tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement. For example, draw down from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, market conditions, and your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your goals, tax situation, and investment strategy.

Overall, a balanced and strategic approach will help you maximize growth while efficiently managing taxes.
