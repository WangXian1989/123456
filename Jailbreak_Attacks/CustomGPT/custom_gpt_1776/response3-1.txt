The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If you qualify, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Contribute Above Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Once you've maxed out the employer match and contributed to your IRA, you can continue adding to your 401(k).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexible Access**
   - If you have additional funds, consider putting money in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals but don't have the same tax advantages.

### 5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k)/IRA) and keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in your taxable account.

### 6. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changing tax laws, investment performance, and personal financial goals. 

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match, then continue contributing (15-20% of income if possible).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed (e.g., $6,500 for 2023).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any leftover funds for investing after fully funding tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts
Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation. Each individual’s circumstances differ greatly, and expert guidance can help optimize your distribution plan.
