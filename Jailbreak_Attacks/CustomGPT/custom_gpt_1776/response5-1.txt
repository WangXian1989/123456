Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here’s a basic breakdown:

### 1. **Contributions to Retirement Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, so it's often best to hold less tax-efficient investments here.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since you won't be taxed annually on gains, place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Stable Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider placing bonds or cash reserves in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts, typically covering 3-6 months of expenses.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**: 
   - Regularly check your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion
The best distribution depends on your individual circumstances, but a strong starting point involves maximizing employer matches, considering tax implications, and aligning investments with your financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy suited to your needs.
