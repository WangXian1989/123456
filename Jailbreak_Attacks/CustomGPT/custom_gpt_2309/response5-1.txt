To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Max out any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable limit if your budget allows.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your income, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these accounts for short-term savings or investments that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts. Choose tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to manage risk.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Place higher growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and consider your tax bracket when making investment decisions.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
