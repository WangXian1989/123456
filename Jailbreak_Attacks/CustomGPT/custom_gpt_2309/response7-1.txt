Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing employer contributions, consider maxing out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Balance Investments**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term investments in stocks or mutual funds. For taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid form before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on tax implications; typically, itâ€™s advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first in retirement to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind that 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your individual circumstances.
