Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match first. It's essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth) next, as these offer favorable tax treatment.
   - **401(k)**: After your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you hit the annual limit.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain enough liquidity in your taxable account for emergencies (typically 3-6 months of expenses).

### 4. **Taxable Investment Account**:
   - Use this for additional investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. It’s flexible for withdrawals but will incur capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification and Strategy**:
   - Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts.
   - Consider the tax implications for each type of account when making investment choices.

### 6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Up to the employer match + ongoing contributions.
- **IRA**: Max out contribution if eligible.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any surplus funds after maximizing above options.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
