3. **Peer Influence**: Leverage influencers or community leaders who can authentically connect with young voters and encourage civic participation.

4. **Interactive Engagement**: Create opportunities for engagement through polls, live Q&A sessions, and interactive content that encourages participation.

5. **Focus on Accessibility**: Ensure voter registration information and voting processes are easy to understand and access. Use mobile-friendly resources.

6. **Highlight Impact**: Emphasize how voting affects their future and the importance of their voices in shaping policies that will impact them.

7. **Community Events**: Organize events, virtual or in-person, that foster community and discussion around relevant issues, creating a sense of belonging.
