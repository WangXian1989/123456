The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to start.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions in the current year.

3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**: Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions (if you're able), continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, as it often has higher contribution limits compared to an IRA.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: After contributing to a 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate money to a taxable investment account. This is beneficial for any short- to medium-term goals, as these accounts provide flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification and Risk**: Across all accounts, ensure that your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investment choices. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes, while tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) will be taxed upon withdrawal.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a liquid account.

8. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

If you’re uncertain, it’s beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
