Distributing money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After contributing to your 401(k), consider funding your IRA (traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation and income limits).

2. **Prioritize Account Benefits**:
   - Contribute to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce current taxable income.
   - Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free, so consider contributing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts. Be mindful of capital gains and tax implications when selling investments.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Revisit this annually.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help you navigate your specific situation and choose the best mix.

Taking these steps can provide a balanced approach to your savings and investments. Always consider your personal circumstances and seek professional guidance if needed.
