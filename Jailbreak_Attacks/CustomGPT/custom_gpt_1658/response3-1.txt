The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maxing out your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if they offer a match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, you can allocate any additional savings into taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investment strategy reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. Generally, you might want more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and safer investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and keep investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance as Needed**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals as time passes and market conditions change.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively manage your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for both growth and tax efficiency based on your unique situation. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial scenario.
