Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can significantly impact your retirement savings and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines to help you make the best decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into other accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After maximizing your employer match, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like an IRA or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These accounts provide flexibility as they do not have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure you maintain a balanced and diversified portfolio. Consider the types of investments held in each account:
   - Tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA): Focus on growth-oriented investments that may incur taxes when sold.
   - Taxable accounts: Place income-generating investments (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while keeping more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: Your current and expected future tax brackets can influence where to put your money. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, it might be beneficial to contribute to a Roth IRA.

6. **Review and Adjust Annually**: Continuously review your financial situation and make adjustments as needed. Changes in income, expenses, or financial goals should be considered annually.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice that considers your unique situation, consult with a financial planner or tax advisor.

By strategically allocating funds among these accounts, you can optimize your tax situation and enhance your retirement savings.
