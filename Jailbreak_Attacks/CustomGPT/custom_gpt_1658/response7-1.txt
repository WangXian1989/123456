Distributing your money optimally among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If you have a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This essentially gives you free money towards your retirement.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Once you've maxed out the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Roth or Traditional) next. These accounts offer tax advantages that can significantly benefit your long-term growth.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, provided certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, which should be a consideration for short-term versus long-term gains.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts**: Make sure your investments are diversified across all accounts. This helps manage risk effectively. You may want to hold different assets in each account to take advantage of the tax treatments.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation. This ensures you're staying aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For a personalized plan, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific circumstances.

By taking these steps, you can create a well-rounded strategy that maximizes your retirement savings potential while considering your individual needs and situations.
