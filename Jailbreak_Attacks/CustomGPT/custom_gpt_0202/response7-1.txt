To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize IRAs for Tax Benefits**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. Aim to max out these accounts if possible (the maximum contribution limits can vary by year).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and potentially lower long-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy within each account type based on your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
