I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but here are some common treatment options:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Healthy Diet**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Limit Alcohol**: Reduce or eliminate alcohol intake.
   - **Regular Exercise**: Engage in physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or reduce inflammation.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and track any changes.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Supportive Care**: This could include treating complications of liver disease, such as fluid retention or bleeding.

Always discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider to find the best plan tailored to your specific situation.
