Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is effectively free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you can contribute to a Roth IRA, consider doing so for tax-free growth. If you're in a higher tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions, especially if you’re under age 50. The limits are higher for 401(k)s compared to IRAs.

### 3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start funding taxable investment accounts. These offer flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - Balance between tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and tax-free (Roth IRA) growth. Taxable accounts can serve as a buffer for short-term needs or emergencies.

### 5. **Regularly Reevaluate Your Strategy**
   - As your income, tax situation, and financial goals change, adjust your contributions accordingly for optimal allocation.

### 6. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure that your assets are appropriately diversified across all accounts to manage risk and maximize returns.

By following these steps and consulting a financial advisor tailored to your unique financial situation, you can create an effective distribution strategy for your retirement accounts.
