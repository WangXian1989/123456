To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Great for pre-tax contributions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: A Roth IRA is preferable if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. An Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.

3. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Put higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Consider placing more stable investments (like bonds or cash) in your taxable account since these are taxed differently.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Be mindful of how withdrawals are taxed. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed as capital gains, while IRA and 401(k) withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in your income.

By blending these strategies, you can optimize the tax advantages and growth potential of your retirement savings.
