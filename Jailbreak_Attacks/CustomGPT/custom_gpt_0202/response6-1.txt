To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Focus on tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or investments you might need to access before retirement. They offer flexibility without withdrawal penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains distributions.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - In higher tax brackets, prioritize tax-deferred options (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
   - In lower brackets, consider utilizing Roth options to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversity of Investments**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, including stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.
   - Utilize each account's tax advantages based on your investment strategy.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Assess your allocation annually or after significant market changes.
   - Adjust contributions based on performance and shifting financial goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investments across 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts for maximum efficiency and growth.
