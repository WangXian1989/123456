Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if availableâ€”this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed later.
   - **IRA**: Similar benefits apply for a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider using this account for investments that you may need access to before retirement or for holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds).

3. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider placing higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals. Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term retirement savings, and consider taxable accounts for short-term goals or more liquid investments.

6. **Review Annually**: Regularly assess and adjust your allocation as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial adviser can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
