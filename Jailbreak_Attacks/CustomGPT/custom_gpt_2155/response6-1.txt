Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get company match, if available. 
   - **IRA:** Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use for investments that might generate capital gains or dividends, as these are taxed differently than income.

### 3. **Balance Growth and Safety:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds) as these accounts are intended for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable:** Maintain liquidity with a mix of bonds and stocks.

### Considerations:
- Assess your **overall tax situation** to decide on traditional vs. Roth accounts.
- Monitor and **rebalance** your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

This tailored approach can help optimize your retirement strategy while managing tax implications effectively.
