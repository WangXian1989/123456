The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out an IRA next, especially if you qualify for Roth contributions, which can offer tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be beneficial for funds you may need access to before retirement, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

3. **Assess Investment Goals:**
   - For long-term investments (retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - For shorter-term savings, allocate more to taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

5. **Account Types Matter:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high taxes (like bonds).
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to optimize growth.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio according to changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
