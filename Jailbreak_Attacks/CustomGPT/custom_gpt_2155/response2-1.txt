To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Max out employer matching if available. Generally, prioritize it for high-contribution limits and tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** After 401(k), contribute to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

2. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns, like bonds, where capital gains may be more favorable.
   - Consider holding index funds or ETFs for tax efficiency.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Balance asset allocation across all accounts to ensure diversification. Avoid concentrating too much of one asset type in any single account.

4. **Withdrawal Planning:**
   - Plan withdrawals for retirement carefully. Generally, start with taxable accounts, defer tax-advantaged accounts as long as possible.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Periodically assess your allocation and rebalance as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial planner.

Following these strategies can help optimize your investment growth and tax efficiency.
