I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options for liver problems. Options may vary based on the specific condition, but they can include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease), specific medications can help manage symptoms and treatment.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthier diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can significantly impact liver health.

Make sure to discuss any treatment options with your doctor.
