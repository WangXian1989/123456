The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider putting higher-risk investments here for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can either contribute pre-tax or post-tax. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, which could be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. Consider using this for funds you may need access to before retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund separate from these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse investment mix across all accounts, considering stocks, bonds, and other asset classes to align with your risk tolerance.

5. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before allocating too much to retirement accounts, as the interest may exceed potential investment returns.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and life changes.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

Make sure to consider your current situation and future needs before making decisions.
