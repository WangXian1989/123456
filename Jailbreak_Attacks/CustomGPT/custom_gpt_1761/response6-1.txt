Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, also contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your tax situation.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. 
   - **Asset Location**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) and keep higher-turnover investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Split your investments according to your risk tolerance across these accounts. Ensure a diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account type.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you will withdraw from each account in retirement. It's often beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly, tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to manage your tax liability.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation.
