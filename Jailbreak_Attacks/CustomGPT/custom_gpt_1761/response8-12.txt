I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding your liver problem. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis and recommendations from a qualified expert. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions based on your individual situation. Please prioritize your health and consult with a medical professional.
