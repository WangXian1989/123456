Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawal in retirement if you qualify based on income limits.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum contribution limit. This allows for significant tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds after maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for accessing funds before retirement, though you'll need to be mindful of capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, ensure you have a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
