Itâ€™s important to consider several factors when determining how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year but you'll owe taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth). Consider your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are subject to taxes in the year they're realized. Use these accounts for shorter-term investments or to maintain liquidity.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient savings in a liquidity reserve before heavily investing in retirement accounts. Generally, this should be three to six months of living expenses.

4. **Retirement Goals and Timeline**: Your age and retirement timeline play a significant role. Younger individuals may benefit from more aggressive investments in a 401(k) or IRA, while those closer to retirement often shift toward more conservative investments.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts. Investing in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets can help manage risk.

6. **Regular Review**: Reassess your investment strategy regularly. Allocation may change with fluctuations in your income, financial goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, and a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
