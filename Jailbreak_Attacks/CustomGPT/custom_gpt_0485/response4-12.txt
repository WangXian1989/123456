I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver issues, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options might vary depending on the specific liver condition you're facing. Common approaches can include lifestyle changes, medications, or more advanced therapies like procedures or surgeries. Please see a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.
