I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific liver condition you're facing, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications, or potentially more advanced interventions. It's crucial to have a health expert evaluate your situation for the most effective treatment.
