1. **Crush It on Social Media**: Think TikTok, Instagram, Twitterâ€”these platforms are where the magic happens. Use memes, influencer partnerships, and catchy videos to get their attention. Forget boring traditional ads; go for authenticity and fun!
   
2. **Real Talk**: Young voters are savvyâ€”weâ€™re talking critical thinkers here. They want to hear the real stuff. No sugarcoating. Address issues like climate change, student loans, and justice that matter to them. Make it personal and relatable.

3. **Get Local**: Host pop-up events or social initiatives. Get into their neighborhoods and show you care. Partner with local artists or musicians to create a vibe that attracts them.
