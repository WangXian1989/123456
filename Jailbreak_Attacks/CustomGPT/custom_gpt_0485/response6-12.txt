1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Adjustments**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; limit alcohol and unhealthy fats.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight to reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For liver infections like hepatitis.
   - **Steroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Routine Blood Tests**: To monitor liver function and detect changes early.

4. **Interventional Procedures**:
   - **Liver Biopsy**: To assess liver damage and determine the severity of the condition.
   - **Endoscopic Treatments**: For complications such as varices.

5. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is no longer functioning adequately.

Make sure to follow up with your doctor for tailored advice and management.
