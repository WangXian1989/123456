Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some key points to help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide whether you want to contribute pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth) based on your current tax bracket and expected future income.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Use a traditional IRA if you want the tax deduction now.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need access to before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when trading in these accounts; holding investments for more than a year can lead to a lower tax rate on gains.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Short-Term vs. Long-Term**: Fund your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth. Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that may incur taxes.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investment across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation changes or as retirement approaches.

5. **Consult a Professional**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your financial objectives while maximizing tax efficiency and growth potential.
