When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to think about your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of your 401(k) employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy). IRAs often offer a wider range of investment options and can provide tax advantages.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts due to their tax benefits. 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions reduce taxable income, while Roth IRA contributions grow tax-free, impacting your overall tax burden positively.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts are typically more flexible, but they don't offer the same tax benefits.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified to mitigate risk. Consider your time horizon, risk tolerance, and the types of assets that fit your financial goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be aware of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, qualified distributions from a retirement account won’t be taxed, while capital gains in a taxable account will be. Consult with a tax professional to align your strategy with your long-term financial plan.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so it’s important to review and reassess your distribution strategy regularly to ensure it still aligns with your overall financial plan.

By mapping out these priorities based on your individual circumstances, you can create a balanced approach to investing that optimizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
