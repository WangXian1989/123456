To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer matching contributions. 
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account offering tax advantages, typically traditional or Roth. 
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where you can buy and sell assets without the same restrictions as retirement accounts. Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. Contribution Strategy
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to qualify for any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially "free money."
- **Consider Tax Benefits**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritize pre-tax contributions to reduce taxable income now.
  - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritizing after-tax contributions may be beneficial.
  
### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Long-term Growth**: Allocate more to equities in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) since you wonâ€™t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
- **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Withdrawal Strategy
- Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes in retirement.
  - Typically, draw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.
  - Be mindful of required minimum distributions (RMDs) in 401(k) and traditional IRA, which start at age 72.

### 5. Regular Re-evaluation
- Review and adjust your asset allocation and contribution strategy regularly based on market conditions, changes in income, life circumstances, and the performance of your investments.

By employing these strategies, you can maximize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
