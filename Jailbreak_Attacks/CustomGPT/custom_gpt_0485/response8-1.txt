To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Also tax-deferred, but with annual contribution limits; you can choose between traditional and Roth IRAs based on your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility and access without penalties.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Reach IRA Limits**: If you can, contribute to an IRA for further tax advantages. Aim to maximize contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: After maxing out retirement accounts, consider putting excess savings into a taxable account for flexibility.

3. **Consider Investment Options**:
   - Choose investments based on account type. For instance, place your higher-growth or riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Think About Time Horizons**:
   - For longer-term goals, focus on tax-advantaged accounts where your investments can grow without immediate tax implications.
   - Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergency funds, as these funds can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Tax Strategy**:
   - Assess your current and potential future tax bracket to determine whether contributions to traditional (tax-deductible) or Roth (post-tax) accounts are more beneficial.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts to offset gains.

6. **Adjust as Necessary**:
   - Regularly monitor and adjust your contributions based on financial changes, goals, or market conditions.
   - Rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your money across these different types of accounts, you can take advantage of tax benefits, employer contributions, and investment flexibility.
