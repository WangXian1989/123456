To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and future tax considerations.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. On the other hand, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA could save you money on taxes now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, taxable accounts are ideal for short-to-medium-term savings since they allow for more flexibility in withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, ensure your investments are diversified based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly revisit your portfolio allocations and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and investment objectives.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By following these principles, you can optimize your investment strategy across multiple account types, maximizing both growth and tax efficiency.
