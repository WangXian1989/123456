To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max out employer-sponsored 401(k)** contributions, especially to benefit from employer matching.
   - Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) for additional tax advantages.
   
2. **Asset Allocation by Account Type**:
   - Place **higher-growth investments** (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for **more tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or tax-exempt bonds) to minimize taxable distributions.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Invest in a **Roth IRA** if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, allowing for tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use **Traditional IRAs or 401(k)s** for tax deductions if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

By following these strategies, you'll effectively distribute your investments across different accounts to maximize growth potential and minimize tax liabilities.
