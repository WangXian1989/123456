The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, you might prefer it for its tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can consider opening or contributing to a taxable account for more flexible investing. This is especially useful if you may need access to your funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts. For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs), you can hold higher growth investments (like stocks) because you won't pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal (Traditional) or not at all (Roth). In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax bracket. Balancing your contributions can help manage your tax burden over time.

6. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing in these accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

Ultimately, the right distribution strategy will depend on your individual circumstances, so it's crucial to evaluate your options regularly.
