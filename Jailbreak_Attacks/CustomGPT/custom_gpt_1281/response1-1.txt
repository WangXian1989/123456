Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline for allocation:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a mix of stock and bond funds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Younger investors can typically afford more risk and thus might favor stocks.
   - **Tax Considerations**: 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year.

### 2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional vs. Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Like a 401(k), contributions are typically tax-deductible; taxes are due on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be beneficial for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Strategy**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more liquidity and easier access to funds without penalties, making them useful for shorter-term needs.
   - **Investment Choices**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs), and be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling assets.
   - **Asset Location**: You may want to hold investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and lower-turnover investments in taxable accounts.

### 4. **General Recommendations**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified across sectors, asset classes, and international markets.
   - **Regular Review**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with changing market conditions or life circumstances.
   - **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice based on your specific situation, consulting a financial professional can provide personalized strategies.

### Conclusion
A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k), particularly if there's an employer match, then fully fund an IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to a taxable account. Keep in mind your own financial goals and timelines to determine the best strategy for you.
