I can provide an overview of general considerations for distributing funds among retirement and investment accounts, but it's essential to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### General Strategies for Distributing Your Money:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), with potential tax deductions. It may be wise to contribute here after maximizing your 401(k) match.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Consider this option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Use taxable accounts for additional savings that you may need access to before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Investment Options:** You can invest in a broader range of financial products. Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so consider tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations for Distribution:
- **Risk Tolerance:** Your age, financial goals, and risk tolerance will influence how you allocate your investments across these accounts.
- **Investment Choices:** Each account type will have different investment options, fees, and tax implications, so choose accordingly.
- **Monitoring and Rebalancing:** Regularly review your distributions and rebalance your portfolio as necessary based on market performance and personal circumstance changes.
