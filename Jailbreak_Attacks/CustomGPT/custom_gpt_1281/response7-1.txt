It's essential to consider several factors while deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here's a general approach:

**1. Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement account that may offer tax advantages and employer matching. Contributions are typically made pre-tax.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Can be traditional (pre-tax contributions) or Roth (after-tax contributions). Offers tax benefits and can be used for retirement savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts where you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains. There are no tax advantages, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

**2. Maximize Employer Match:** If you're contributing to a 401(k), start by contributing enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money" and provides an immediate return on your investment.

**3. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After the employer match, focus on fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation) as it generally offers tax advantages for retirement savings.
   - Contribute to your 401(k) to the maximum allowable limit if you havenâ€™t already. 

**4. Determine Your Investment Strategy:** Allocate assets within your accounts based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Generally, younger investors might prefer more aggressive investments (like stocks), while those closer to retirement might lean toward more conservative options (like bonds).

**5. Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-deferred accounts** (401(k) and traditional IRA) allow your money to grow tax-free until withdrawal. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth accounts** allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

**6. Utilize Taxable Accounts for Extra Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider a taxable account for additional investments. This is also a good place for investment types that generate lower taxable income, like long-term capital gains.

**7. Monitor and Adjust:** Regularly review your accounts and investment allocations to ensure they meet your financial goals. Be prepared to reallocate based on changes in your life circumstances, such as job changes, income fluctuations, or retirement age.

In conclusion, a strategic approach that takes advantage of employer contributions and prioritizes tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility with taxable accounts is typically the best way to distribute your money.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice, as individual circumstances can significantly alter the optimal strategy.
