When considering how to distribute your investments among a 401(k), IRA (Individual Retirement Account), and taxable accounts, it’s important to evaluate the unique advantages and purposes of each account type. Here’s a comprehensive approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account’s Characteristics:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions.
     - Contributions are often tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:**
     - Individual retirement account offering tax advantages.
     - Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deferred growth, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Investment accounts that do not have tax advantages.
     - Capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:**
     - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits:**
     - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawal. If not, focus on a Traditional IRA for its immediate tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
     - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need access to before retirement, as they provide more liquidity.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Risk Tolerance and Goals:**
     - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to guide your asset allocation across accounts.
   - **Tax Efficiency:**
     - Holding tax-inefficient investments (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) can minimize tax burdens.
     - Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - **Rebalance as Needed:**
     - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and market conditions.
   - **Adapt to Life Changes:**
     - Adjust contributions based on changes in income, eligibility for account types, or retirement goals.

### Conclusion: 
To effectively distribute your investments:
- Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if there's a match.
- Utilize IRAs for additional tax advantages and flexibility based on your current tax situation.
- Allocate any remaining investments to taxable accounts for liquidity and potential growth opportunities.
