Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions if you can (the annual limit is set by the IRS).
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement since withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs can be deductible, lowering your taxable income.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Income generated in tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or Traditional IRA) is taxed upon withdrawal.
   - Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes on profits from sales; however, you can offset some of this with capital losses.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep more aggressive investments in your tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax implications (like stocks or equity funds).
   - Use your taxable account for more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains distributions.

4. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unforeseen expenses.

5. **Regular Rebalancing and Review**: 
   - Life changes can impact your financial situation, so regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on age, retirement plans, and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - Individual circumstances vary greatly, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your long-term goals.

This approach aims to balance growth potential with tax efficiency while ensuring you have access to funds when needed.
