I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice regarding liver problems. Treatment options can vary based on the specific condition affecting your liver, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medication to manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions, and in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation.

It's crucial to get an accurate diagnosis and follow a treatment plan tailored to your needs, so please reach out to a healthcare provider for guidance.
