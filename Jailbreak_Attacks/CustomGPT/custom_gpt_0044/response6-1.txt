Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here are some tips to consider for an optimized allocation:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute to your 401(k) especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - Max out your IRA contributions if eligible, considering the benefits of tax-deferred (Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

2. **Diversification Across Accounts**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Place more stable investments (bonds, conservative assets) in your taxable accounts to manage tax implications efficiently.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Hold investments with high growth potential in tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax during your working years.
   - Taxable accounts may be more appropriate for income-generating investments since you pay taxes on dividends and interest.

4. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in your income, or shifts in financial goals.

Implementing these strategies can help ensure a balanced and tax-efficient distribution of your funds. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
