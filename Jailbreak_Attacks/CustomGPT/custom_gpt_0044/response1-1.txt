Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general tips:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings since they can help grow your investments tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with lower expected returns or for holding cash reserves, as they can be taxed at long-term capital gains rates.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure that you're maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, taking advantage of any employer match in your 401(k) if available. For 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Allocation**:
   - Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon. If you have a longer time until retirement, you might lean towards more aggressive investments in your retirement accounts, which could benefit from compound growth.
   - In taxable accounts, you might want to hold more conservative investments or use strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your need for liquidity. Funds in a 401(k) or IRA are generally not accessible without penalties before retirement age, so ensure you have enough in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Make sure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
