It sounds like you're looking for investment strategies! The best distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are a few key points to consider:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, it's often a good idea to contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money. Additionally, contributions are pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s), which can help reduce your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing any employer match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while contributions to a Roth IRA grow tax-free. Depending on your income level, one may be more beneficial than the other.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you're maximizing your retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility with no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

Consider your overall financial situation, including your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline, to determine the proportionate allocation that makes sense for you. Consulting with a financial advisor may also provide personalized guidance that aligns with your goals.
