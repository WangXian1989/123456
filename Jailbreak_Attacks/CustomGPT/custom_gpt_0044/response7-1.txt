Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to accounts that provide tax advantages. Start with your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. Contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax preference. A traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to a taxable brokerage account. This provides more flexibility, as you can access the money without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Assess Your Investment Strategy**: Diversify across different asset classes within each account. For instance, consider higher-risk investments in your taxable account, where you can manage taxes on capital gains.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your unique situation.
