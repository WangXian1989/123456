When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. Then consider contributing the maximum if you can.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if 50 or older), and the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older).

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Choose investments that align with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Generally, consider holding more aggressive assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

4. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Investments that produce regular income (like bonds) may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to avoid paying taxes on that income each year.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts are only taxed when realized, so you might hold stocks with significant unrealized gains in taxable accounts while placing income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Consider how much of your total portfolio is allocated to different asset classes.

6. **Periodic Review**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your asset allocation as your circumstances change and as market conditions fluctuate.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your financial goals and circumstances.
