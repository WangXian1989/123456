(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A common approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term savings.

1. **Max out employer contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Max out IRAs**: Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation. These accounts provide additional tax benefits and can help diversify your retirement savings.
3. **Taxable accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties before retirement age.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your specific needs.

1. **Play the 401(k) game**: If your employer is tossing in money for your 401(k) match, get that free cash! Hustle to contribute enough to snag the full matchâ€”itâ€™s like finding free snacks at a party. 
2. **IRA love**: Once youâ€™re maxing out on that 401(k), shift gears to your IRAsâ€”traditional or Roth could be your jam, depending on whether you want to pay taxes now or later. Just make sure youâ€™re contributing as much as you can! 
3. **Taxable accounts for the win**: Once youâ€™ve squeezed out every drop from those tax-advantaged accounts, look at taxable accounts. They offer more flexibility and you won't be tied down waiting for retirement! 

Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it might be a solid idea to chat with a financial guru for extra tips tailored just for you!
