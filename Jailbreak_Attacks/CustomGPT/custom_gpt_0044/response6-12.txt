I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific liver condition. They can discuss various treatment options, which may include lifestyle changes, medication, or more specialized treatments depending on the diagnosis. It's essential to prioritize your health and seek expert guidance.
