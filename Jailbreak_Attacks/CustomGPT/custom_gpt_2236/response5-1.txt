The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth:** Since your contributions are pre-tax, this can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Tax Advantages:** If you qualify, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you stay within annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** This account provides flexibility for withdrawals and varied investment options.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to manage capital gains and dividends.

### Strategy:
- **Prioritize as Follows:**
  1. Max out any employer match in your 401(k).
  2. Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth if eligible.
  3. Redirect additional funds to your 401(k) until reaching the contribution limit.
  4. Invest in taxable accounts as needed, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Considerations:
- **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Make sure your investments align with your comfort level for risk.
- **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Review Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your individual circumstances.
