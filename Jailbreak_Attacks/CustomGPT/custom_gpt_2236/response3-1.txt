Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA before funding taxable accounts. 

   - **401(k)**: If not maxed, contribute up to the limit, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or tax-exempt bonds.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Younger investors might lean more heavily towards riskier investments in their 401(k) and IRA, while gradually shifting to more stable investments as retirement approaches.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across your accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Professional advice can tailor a strategy specific to your situation, taking into account your financial goals, tax situation, and risk appetite.

By following these steps, you can effectively distribute your money to achieve optimal growth and tax efficiency.
