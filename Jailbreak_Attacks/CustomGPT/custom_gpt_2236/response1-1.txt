Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investment beyond tax-advantaged accounts. These can provide flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on longer-term growth investments (like stocks) since withdrawals are penalized until retirement age.
   - **IRA**: Consider your tax situation; traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate for more liquid and shorter-term investments, keeping in mind capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts to mitigate risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically and adjust to maintain your desired risk level.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
