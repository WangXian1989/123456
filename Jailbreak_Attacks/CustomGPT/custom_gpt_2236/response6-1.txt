Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively typically involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for immediate tax benefits.

### 2. **Allocate Funds Based on Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Goals (Retirement):**
     - Prioritize contributions to 401(k) and IRA for their tax benefits.
   - **Short-Term Goals:**
     - Utilize taxable accounts as these offer more flexibility with withdrawals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts, adapting based on the account's tax implications.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** It’s often wise to hold higher-growth assets here since taxes won’t be realized until withdrawal.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy as you approach retirement.

### Summary:
- **Initial Focus:** Max out contributions to 401(k) for the match, then contribute to IRA, with excess going to taxable accounts.
- **Investment Strategy:** Ensure tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and growth-heavy investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation and goals.
