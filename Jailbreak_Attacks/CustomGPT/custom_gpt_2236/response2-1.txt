Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (if available). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, max out your contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for added tax advantages.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, and you pay taxes upon withdrawal. They are suitable for higher income brackets, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your income (and tax rate) to increase in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties. Be mindful of capital gains tax. Use this account for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term gains to minimize tax implications.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: Generally focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds) since these have tax-deferred growth potential.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding more conservative investments or those generating lower taxable income (like bonds) to manage tax liability.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. This protects you from needing to withdraw from your investment accounts prematurely.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investment performance and adjust based on changes in financial goals, market conditions, and personal circumstances.

### General Distribution Guidelines:
- Consider a rough allocation:
  - 40% in your 401(k)
  - 30% in your IRA
  - 30% in taxable accounts

This distribution can vary based on individual circumstances, so it's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
