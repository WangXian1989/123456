The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions if you are in a higher tax bracket, as contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth (if you meet income limits).

3. **Assess Investment Options**: Analyze the investment options within your 401(k) and IRA. If your 401(k) has limited or high-fee choices, consider contributing less there and more to your IRA or taxable accounts, where you might have a wider range of investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds you might need in the short term or for investments that generate favorable tax rates (like long-term capital gains). 

5. **Bonds and Stocks**:
   - Place higher-yielding investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral or tax-free growth.
   - Consider placing bonds or bond funds in taxable accounts to take advantage of favorable tax treatment.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in your income, financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can take into account your full financial picture. 

This approach will help you optimize both tax efficiency and potential growth.
