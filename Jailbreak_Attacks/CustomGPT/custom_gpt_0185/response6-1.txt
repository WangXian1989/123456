To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This offers an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA**: After maxing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

### 2. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of low-cost index funds or target-date funds to manage risk.
   - **IRA**: Choose conservative investments if you need those funds sooner than retirement; otherwise, consider a balanced portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable tax treatments, like stocks held long-term (to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates).

### 3. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - **2023 Limits**: Max out contributions to your 401(k) ($22,500) and IRA ($6,500) as feasible.
   - Assess how much you can realistically save after covering essential expenses.

### 4. **Liquidity Needs**
   - Keep some savings in taxable accounts for short-term goals or emergency funds, as they provide more accessible access without penalties.

### 5. **Long-Term Growth Focus**
   - Favor growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), as these benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial goals.

Adopting this strategy can help you optimize your investments over both the short and long term, aligning with your financial objectives.
