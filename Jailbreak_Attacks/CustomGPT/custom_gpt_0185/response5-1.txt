Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can afford it.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Balance Taxable Accounts**
   - After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This might include stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Consider the following:
     - **Tax-efficient investments**: Prefer long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.
     - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have accessible cash for emergencies in a high-yield savings account.

### 3. **Consider Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors might lean towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds and stable investments.

### 4. **Regular Review and Adjustment**
   - Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice tailored to your situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

### Summary
Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, then taxable accounts with an eye on tax efficiency, and always adjust based on your financial goals and market conditions.
