Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**:
   - If you’re eligible, fully fund your traditional or Roth IRA next. This account offers tax advantages and potential for tax-free growth.

3. **Utilize Additional 401(k) Contributions**:
   - If you can afford to, contribute more to your 401(k) after maxing out your IRA, especially if it's a high-growth investment.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts last. They’re less tax-efficient but provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure you have a balanced portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Assess how withdrawals will be taxed in retirement. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts are tax-free after meeting conditions.

7. **Adjust Based on Life Stages**:
   - Review and adjust your allocations as you age or as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your specific circumstances.
