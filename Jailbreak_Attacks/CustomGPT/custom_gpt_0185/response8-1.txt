To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Use for higher contributions due to employer matches. Invest in tax-efficient funds.
   - **IRA**: Ideal for long-term growth; consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for shorter-term goals and keep tax-efficient investments, like index funds.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) first.
   - Contributions to IRAs (traditional or Roth) should be next.
   - Use taxable accounts for extra savings after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Types**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for less tax-efficient assets, such as bonds.

4. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Be aware of the tax implications for early withdrawals from each account type.

5. **Age and Goals**:
   - If younger, prioritize aggressive growth in retirement accounts.
   - As you approach retirement, shift towards safer investments to protect your capital.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically based on changes in income, life goals, and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
