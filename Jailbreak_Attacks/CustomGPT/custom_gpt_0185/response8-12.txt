I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or slow progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests help monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further liver damage.

5. **Vaccinations**: Staying updated on vaccines for hepatitis A and B can protect liver health.

6. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant might be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options tailored to your specific condition.
