The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term growth:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are due upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), with potential tax deductions depending on your income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Consider Your Tax Rate**: If you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future, you might want to prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) so you pay taxes now rather than later. Conversely, if you think you will be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

4. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account and consider paying down high-interest debt, as the interest saved may provide better returns than investments.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These are more flexible, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties before retirement age, though you may be subject to capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, consider a diversified investment strategy based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and overall financial goals. You might want to hold different types of investments in different accounts based on their tax implications.

7. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation and financial goals, and rebalance your portfolio as necessary to stay aligned with your objectives.

It's best to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
