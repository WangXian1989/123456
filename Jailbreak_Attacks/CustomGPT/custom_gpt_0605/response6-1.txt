When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take a strategic approach that maximizes tax efficiency, growth potential, and aligns with your investment goals. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions and offers tax-deferred growth. Good for maximizing employer benefits.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
  - *Traditional IRA*: Contributions may be tax-deductible, tax-deferred growth. Withdrawals taxed as regular income.
  - *Roth IRA*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible investment options without tax advantages; however, capital gains and dividends are taxable in the year they are received.

### 2. Evaluate Your Tax Situation:
- If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA).
- If you are in a higher tax bracket now, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals later.
- Use taxable accounts for short-term goals since they provide liquidity without penalties for early withdrawal.

### 3. Contribution Strategy:
- Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Then, contribute to an IRA (either type based on your tax situation) to benefit from additional tax advantages.
- Finally, use any remaining funds for contributions to a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### 4. Diversification and Investment Choice:
- Within each account, ensure you diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and long-term goals.
- Consider index funds, ETFs, or a mix of stocks and bonds tailored to your investment horizon.

### 5. Revisit and Adjust:
- Regularly review your portfolio balance and performance, adjusting your contributions and allocations as necessary based on market conditions and personal financial goals.

By distributing your money strategically across these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
