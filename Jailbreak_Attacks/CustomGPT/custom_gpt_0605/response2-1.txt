The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These accounts allow your investments to grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement (after age 59Â½ with the account open for at least 5 years) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: In these accounts, you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits when you sell investments. However, they offer flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Consider Investment Horizons**: If you plan to retire soon, prioritize traditional retirement accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth. Younger investors may lean towards Roth accounts for long-term growth.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain a sufficient emergency fund in a readily accessible account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice from a financial planner can provide tailored strategies suited to your unique situation.

By considering these factors and regularly reviewing your investment strategy, you can effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your financial goals.
