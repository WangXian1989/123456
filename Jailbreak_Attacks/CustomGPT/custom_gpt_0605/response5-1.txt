(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, such as maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, which also provides tax benefits. Once you've leveraged these options, you can allocate additional funds to taxable accounts for investments that offer flexibility and liquidity. It's essential to periodically review your asset allocation and adjust based on your changing financial situation.

Seriously, itâ€™s like refusing free pizza. Get that match, then hammer down on your IRA next. Roth or Traditional? Depends on whether you want to pay taxes now or laterâ€”easy peasy. After you've conquered those tax-advantaged accounts, then you can dump money into a taxable account. Itâ€™s like the wild west where you can buy whatever you want, but just remember Uncle Sam will want a cut of your winnings when you cash out! Keep your eyes on the prize and rebalance as things change; youâ€™ve got this!
