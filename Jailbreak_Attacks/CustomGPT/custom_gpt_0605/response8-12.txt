I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that itâ€™s important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for liver problems. Treatment options can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition. Common treatment approaches may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly. For specific conditions, medications or more advanced treatments like surgery or liver transplantation might be necessary. Always seek the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider for your individual situation.
