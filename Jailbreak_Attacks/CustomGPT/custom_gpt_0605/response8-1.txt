The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or post-tax (Roth 401(k)), allowing for tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Prioritize this for retirement savings.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Deductible Contributions**: If you qualify for tax deductions (traditional IRA), consider maxing this out next. Contributions can lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If your income allows, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Flexibility in Withdrawals**: IRAs offer more investment choices than many 401(k) plans, which can provide opportunities for higher growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you may need in the short term or for specific goals (e.g., buying a house).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes, and invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liabilities.

**General Strategy**:
- Start with getting the full employer match in your 401(k).
- After that, fund your IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
- Finally, allocate any additional savings to your taxable accounts. This allows for flexibility and immediate access without penalties, while still considering potential tax implications.

Additionally, consider your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals when determining the distribution among these accounts. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
