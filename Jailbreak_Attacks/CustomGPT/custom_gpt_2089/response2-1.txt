Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - **Maximize employer contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before moving on to other accounts.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Contribute to your IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.
   - **Max out your 401(k)**: Aim to contribute up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for 2023, with an additional $7,500 catch-up for those 50+).

### 3. **Consider Tax-Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable accounts**: Use for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes. Avoid holding high-turnover investments here to reduce capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - **Liquid Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before fully investing in these accounts.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Match your investment choices to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider more aggressive investments for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly**:
   - **Reassess allocations**: Periodically review your distributions and performance. Adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 20-30% (to maximize match and tax deferral)
- **IRA**: 10-20% (prioritize based on tax advantages)
- **Taxable accounts**: 30-50% (for flexibility and liquidity)

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach, maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility in taxable accounts, is often best. Consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized plan tailored to your specific situation.
