Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution if possible.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments with lower taxes, such as index funds or stocks you plan to hold long-term.
   - Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance. Include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes.

4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to stay aligned with your investment goals.

5. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before heavily investing. This typically should cover 3-6 months of expenses.

6. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Define short-term versus long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term needs and retirement accounts for long-term growth.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure of the best strategy for your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Adjust your approach as your financial situation or goals change.
