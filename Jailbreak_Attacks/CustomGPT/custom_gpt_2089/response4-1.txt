Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, maximize contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Favor this account for assets expected to appreciate significantly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes. Favor these for investments you plan to hold short-term or for income-generating assets.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on growth.
   - Consider more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts since they generate regular income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes. Typically, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (Roth IRA).

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation is also advisable.
