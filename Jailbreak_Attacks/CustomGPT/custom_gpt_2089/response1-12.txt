I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or treat underlying conditions (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can track liver function and detect any worsening.

4. **Nutritional Support**: Consulting a nutritionist for a tailored diet can support liver function.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: Staying away from harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals, is crucial.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment options.
