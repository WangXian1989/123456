To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund in a separate savings account before investing.

2. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Keep in mind the tax benefits of a 401(k), where your investments grow tax-deferred.

3. **IRA**: 
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals) and a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions with tax on withdrawals). This choice will depend on your current tax bracket and expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Diversification**: Use taxable accounts for investments that produce less taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Consider strategies to offset capital gains with losses in your taxable accounts.

5. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure a balanced asset allocation across all accounts. For instance, you might hold bonds in your tax-advantaged accounts and stocks in your taxable account, especially if they pay dividends.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and investment goals.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to optimize tax efficiency.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance.

This distribution strategy will help you maximize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
