I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for liver issues. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Reducing alcohol consumption.
   - Following a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral medications for hepatitis.
   - Supplements for fatty liver disease (like vitamin E).

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **In Severe Cases**:
   - Transplant may be considered for end-stage liver disease.

Always seek medical advice tailored to your specific condition.
