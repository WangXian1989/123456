To effectively distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize employer match: Contribute enough to get any matching contributions.
   - Tax advantages: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Choose Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation:
     - Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Aim to max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investment opportunities that might yield capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.
   - Keep emergency funds and short-term savings here, as withdrawals are straightforward without penalties.

### Considerations:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.
- **Investment Goals**: Align your asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and financial goals.
- **Tax Impact**: Strategically place higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced investment allocation across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- Prioritize employer match in your 401(k), then max out IRA contributions, followed by additional 401(k) contributions, and finally, invest in your taxable account.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for a personalized plan suited to your specific situation.
