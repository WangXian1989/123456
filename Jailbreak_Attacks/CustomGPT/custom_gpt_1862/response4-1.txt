The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, and the funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider contributing to both traditional and Roth IRAs if eligible. Traditional IRAs provide tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Annual Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for IRAs and adjust your contributions accordingly.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains**: Keep in mind that investments in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Prioritize investments that minimize distributions (like index funds).

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund before investing heavily in retirement accounts.
   - **Diversifying Assets**: Consider the types of investments in each account. For example, place high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about your withdrawal strategy to minimize taxes and penalties.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific circumstances. They can help optimize your investment allocations based on your risk tolerance and financial objectives.
