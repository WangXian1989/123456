Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match since itâ€™s free money. Aim to maximize employee contributions, ideally up to the annual limit.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax outlook. Roth IRAs are generally better for individuals expecting to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends to take advantage of lower tax rates. This can also provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Timeline and Goals**
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Place long-term investments in tax-advantaged accounts to allow for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term needs since they offer more liquidity.

### 4. **Diversify Asset Allocation**
   - Balance between stocks, bonds, and other asset classes based on your risk tolerance. Typically, riskier assets (like stocks) can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts where they benefit from compounding growth.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations as you approach retirement or your goals, ensuring you adapt to changes in market conditions and personal circumstances.

### 6. **Factor in Fees and Expenses**
   - Be aware of the fees associated with your 401(k) and any investment choices within those accounts. Favor low-cost index funds or ETFs when possible.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize to employer match + 10-15% of salary.
- **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) into a Roth or Traditional IRA annually.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any remaining funds after maximizing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Final Thoughts:
It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial picture, goals, and tax situation.
