When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Prioritize contributions here if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Provides tax advantages, with Roth IRAs allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains taxes, but offer flexibility in withdrawals. Ideal for shorter-term goals or needs.

2. **Contribution Strategy**:
   - Prioritize funding your 401(k) to at least the company match.
   - Next, contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for any excess funds or for specific short-term financial goals.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA).
   - Keep stocks with high growth potential in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Retirement Goals**:
   - Assess your retirement timeline. The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative your investments should be.
   - Diversify your investments within each account to spread risk.

Implementing these strategies can help you maximize growth potential while managing risk and tax implications.
