3. **Peer-to-Peer Outreach**: Leverage influencers and peer leaders who can authentically connect with their networks.

4. **Engaging Events**: Host music festivals, community events, or town halls that incorporate elements of entertainment and social interaction.

5. **Mobile-First Approach**: Ensure websites and communication channels are mobile-friendly, providing easy access to information and registration tools.
