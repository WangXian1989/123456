Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility) if you can. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you still have funds available to invest, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Consider investing in low-cost index funds or diversified options.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings. These are useful for short-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement without penalties.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across the accounts for an overall strategic asset allocation tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts, while keeping higher-taxed investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocations as your situation changes, ensuring you stay aligned with your financial goals.
