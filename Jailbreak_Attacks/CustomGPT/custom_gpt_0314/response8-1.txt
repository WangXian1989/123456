To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers matching contributions.
   - Contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) to benefit from tax advantages.

2. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account before investing surplus cash.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - For taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds and other interest-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your financial goals (retirement, home, etc.) and time horizon.
   - Younger investors might emphasize growth (stocks), while those closer to retirement may focus on stability (bonds).

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain diversified investments across all accounts to spread risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and personal goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored insights based on your specific situation.
