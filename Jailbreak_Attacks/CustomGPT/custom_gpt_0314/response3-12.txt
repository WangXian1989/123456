I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver problems often include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, antiviral drugs, corticosteroids, or other medications may be prescribed.
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Dietary modifications, weight management, and regular exercise can be beneficial.
3. **Avoidance of Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is critical.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Please consult a healthcare professional for guidance tailored to your specific situation.
