The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax bracket and future tax expectations.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for additional flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your preferred risk level.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance.
