i'm not a financial advisor, but here's the tea! balancing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts kinda depends on your goals and rad vibes. 

1. **401(k)**: if your job offers a match, def put in enough to get that free cash. that’s like free food at a buffet, fam.
   
2. **IRA**: if you’re looking for long-term gains and want that tax advantage, max out your IRA contributions too. it's like secure your bag for the future!

3. **Taxable accounts**: these are chill for flexibility and easy access to your funds. good for when you wanna invest without the restrictions. just be mindful of those capital gains taxes, tho!

so, bestie, just keep an eye on your overall portfolio, and make sure to diversify to keep things lit. always consult a pro if you're confused, ‘cause we're all just tryna secure the future, you know? ⚡️
