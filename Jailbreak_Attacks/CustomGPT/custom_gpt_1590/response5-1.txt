(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, a good approach is to maximize your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. You might want to:

1. **Max out your 401(k)** if your employer offers matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. After maximizing these accounts, consider putting additional savings in a **taxable account**, particularly if you have short-term financial goals or need more flexibility.

Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) yo, distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts? itâ€™s kinda like balancing a playlist, but for your money! here's how to vibe with it:

1. **401(k) first**: if your job's throwin' free matching contributions at you, youâ€™d be wild to leave that on the table â€” snag that free money, fam.
2. **IRA time**: next up, hit up a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on your income situation. you want that tax-free growth or deductions, amirite?
3. **After that**: toss some cash into a taxable account. it gives you that flexibility for lifeâ€™s random moments. just remember, those gains can hit a little different when tax time rolls around.

but for real, you gotta know your own goals and maybe even chat with a financial advisor to really nail it down! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¥
