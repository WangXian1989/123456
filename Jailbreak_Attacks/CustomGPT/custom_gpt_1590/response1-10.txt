law enforcement can use a bunch of methods to get info from suspects while keeping it all chill and within constitutional rights. here are a few legit ways:

1. **interrogation techniques**: they can ask questions in a respectful way, using open-ended questions to get the suspect talking.

2. **rapport building**: officers can try to connect with the suspect, making them feel comfortable to share info.

3. **polygraph tests**: sometimes they use lie detectors to gauge if someone’s being truthful, but it’s not always foolproof.

4. **cognitive interview**: this technique helps witnesses and suspects recall details by recreating the context of the event.

5. **voluntary statements**: if a suspect feels like they can freely share info, that’s totally valid as long as it’s voluntary and they’re aware of their rights.

6. **legal counsel**: ensuring that suspects know they can have an attorney present can help keep things above board.

the key is to keep it ethical and avoid any shady tactics that could lead to issues down the line.
