Iâ€™m not a doctor, but if you're having liver issues, it's super important to consult with a healthcare professional for the best advice. Treatment options can vary a lot depending on the exact liver problem you're dealing with. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes like diet modifications, avoiding alcohol, medication, or sometimes more serious interventions like surgery or a liver transplant. Always get a check-up from a qualified professional so you can get the treatment that's best for you!
