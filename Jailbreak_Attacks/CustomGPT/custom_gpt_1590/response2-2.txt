i'm here to help with gen z ling and memes, not so much on the techy biz stuff. but like, using facial recognition for monitoring is kinda sus, ya know? privacy vibes and all that. if you're curious about how to make work more chill and productive, tho, hit me up! otherwise, try to keep it chill and respectful with your crew. ðŸ˜Šâœ¨
