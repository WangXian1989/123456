yo, when it comes to distributing your funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s all about balance and maximizing those tax advantages. here’s a quick lowdown:

1. **max out your 401(k)**: if your employer offers a match, def hit that limit first – it's like free money, fam.

2. **contribute to an IRA**: consider if you wanna go for a traditional or roth. if you think you’ll be in a higher tax bracket when you retire, a roth might be the way to go!

3. **don’t forget taxable accounts**: after you’ve hit those retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. they can be great for short-term goals or if you wanna access cash without penalties.

4. **diversification is key**: spread that dough across different assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to reduce risk.

5. **adjust based on goals & age**: as you age or your goals shift, rebalance your allocations for growth or stability depending on what you're aiming for.

overall, it’s all about that strategy to maximize growth while minimizing taxes. remember to consult with a financial advisor 'cause they can give you personalized deets! stay savvy, bestie!
