I’m not a doctor, but it’s important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems. Common treatment options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may help manage symptoms or prevent further damage.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests can track liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always discuss with your doctor to determine the best plan for your situation.
