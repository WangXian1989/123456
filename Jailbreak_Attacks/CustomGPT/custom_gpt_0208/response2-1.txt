Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a traditional IRA could also be beneficial for tax deferral.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Liquidity and Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you may need to access before retirement. They are also good for holding tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which generate fewer taxable events.

3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**:
   - **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Generally, keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-deferred or tax-free. Bonds and income-generating assets can be kept in taxable accounts where you may want different tax treatment.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

5. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Pay attention to the fees associated with investment choices in your 401(k) and IRAs. Lower-cost index funds or ETFs generally offer better long-term growth potential.

6. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**:
   - Align account usage with your time horizon. Long-term goals generally benefit from tax-advantaged growth, while short-term needs are better served through more liquid investments.
