Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and liquidity needs. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Invest in Higher Growth Options**: Since these funds are tax-deferred, consider growth-oriented investments.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Prioritize Roth IRAs**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Use various assets to balance risk and return, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Hold Tax-Efficient Investments**: Consider low-turnover funds, index funds, or municipal bonds, which are more tax-efficient.
   - **Use for Short-Term Goals**: Keep funds here for goals within the next few years, as these accounts offer more liquidity.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Time Horizon**: Longer time horizons can typically take on more risk.
- **Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of how withdrawals will affect your tax situation in retirement.
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain enough liquidity for emergencies outside of these investments.

### Example Strategy:
1. Contribute to your 401(k) to capture the maximum employer match.
2. Invest in a Roth IRA if you qualify, focusing on growth assets.
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments and short-term needs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
