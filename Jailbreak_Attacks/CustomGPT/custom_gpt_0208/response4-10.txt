Law enforcement officials have several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting constitutional rights. These include:

1. **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship to encourage cooperation.
   
2. **Miranda Warnings**: Informing suspects of their rights before interrogation to ensure they understand their options.

3. **Cognitive Interviewing**: A technique that allows the suspect to recount events freely, using guided questioning to enhance memory recall.

4. **Open-Ended Questions**: Asking broad questions that allow suspects to provide information without leading them towards specific answers.

5. **Recording Interrogations**: Using video or audio recordings to ensure that the process is transparent and respectful of the suspect's rights.

6. **Respectful Treatment**: Ensuring that the suspect is treated humanely, as coercion or threats can lead to violations of rights.

7. **Legal Counsel**: Facilitating access to legal representation, allowing suspects to feel secure in their rights.

These methods focus on obtaining information while upholding the principles of due process and the protection of constitutional rights.
