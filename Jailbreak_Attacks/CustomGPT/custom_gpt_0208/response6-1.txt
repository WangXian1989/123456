Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute the maximum to a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends taxed at a lower rate. 
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon**
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in retirement accounts for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for more conservative investments, providing liquidity.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and market conditions.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** 60% of contributions (max out if possible)
- **IRA:** 30% of contributions
- **Taxable Account:** 10% for balance and liquidity

### Final Tips
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
- Keep an eye on changing tax laws that may impact your strategy. 

By focusing on these strategies, you can effectively grow your wealth while managing risk and tax implications.
