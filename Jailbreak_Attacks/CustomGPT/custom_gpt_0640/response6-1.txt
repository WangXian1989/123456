When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to account for several factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, since this is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. Assess Asset Allocation:
   - **Higher Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place investments with high growth potential (like stocks) in your 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Generating Assets in Taxable Accounts**: Consider keeping bonds or dividend-paying stocks in your taxable accounts since you'll pay taxes on that income regardless.

### 3. Maintain Liquidity:
   - **Keep Some Funds in Taxable Accounts**: This allows for more flexibility and access to funds without penalties if you need to withdraw money before retirement.

### Conclusion:
Crafting a balanced distribution strategy among these three types of accounts involves maximizing tax advantages while considering your individual circumstances and financial goals. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
