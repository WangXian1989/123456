The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider your contribution limits and the investment options available in your plan.
   - **IRA**: For traditional IRAs, contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income and other factors. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, so if you qualify, consider contributing here as well.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. However, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can also be beneficial for short-term goals. Focus on holding tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

3. **Debt Management**:
   - If you have high-interest debt, it may be wise to prioritize paying that down first before boosting contributions to your investment accounts.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. Ensure you maintain a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in place before making large contributions to investments. This fund should cover 3-6 months’ worth of expenses, typically kept in a high-yield savings account.

6. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Assess your time horizon for retirement. If you’re decades away, it may make sense to take more risks in your 401(k) or IRA while using taxable accounts for more conservative investments.

7. **Regularly Reassess**:
   - Revisit your distribution strategy regularly as your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals change.

Remember, it’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual circumstances.
