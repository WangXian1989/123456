The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as itâ€™s essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA before putting more into your 401(k).
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, you might want to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. Both accounts have yearly contribution limits.

2. **Consider Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate funds based on when you need the money. Long-term goals may benefit from higher-risk investments, while short-term needs should be more conservative.
   - Keep in mind that your investment allocation (stocks vs. bonds) can vary based on your risk tolerance and time frame.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**:
   - Ensure a good mix of assets in each account type to maintain balance across your total portfolio. For instance, taxable accounts can be used for investments that generate capital gains and dividends, while tax-deferred accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s can be used for more aggressive growth investments.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains tax when assets are sold, while tax-deferred accounts delay taxes until withdrawal. A mix can help manage taxable income in retirement.
   - Keep in mind that after retirement, you will have to take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, which affects tax planning.

5. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**:
   - Your circumstances will change, and so might the performance of your investments. Rebalance your portfolio to ensure you stay on track with your investment goals.

It's highly recommended to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your individual circumstances and objectives for personalized advice.
