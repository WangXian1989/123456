Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Understand the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older).

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you qualify, consider paying taxes now for long-term tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don't have contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments. They may be useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility with withdrawals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) to defer taxes on gains.
   - Bonds or more stable investments can be placed in taxable accounts to take advantage of preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings in cash or low-risk accounts for emergencies before focusing entirely on retirement accounts.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so periodically reassess your strategy and adjust your contributions as necessary.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your circumstances and help you optimize your distribution strategy effectively.
