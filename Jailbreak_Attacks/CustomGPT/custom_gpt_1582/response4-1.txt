To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After the match, consider maxing out a Roth IRA if eligible. If you qualify for a tax deduction, prioritize a Traditional IRA instead.

2. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deferred growth but taxed on withdrawals.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold, so consider holding long-term to minimize taxes.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals.

4. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, prioritize funding taxable accounts, as they do not have penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing higher-risk assets (like stocks) in retirement accounts for tax efficiency, while using taxable accounts for more stable assets or investments that generate regular income.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Regularly review and adjust allocations to ensure they align with your changing goals and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your situation.
