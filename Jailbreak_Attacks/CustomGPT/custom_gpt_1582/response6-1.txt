When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to guide your strategy:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Generally tax-deferred, meaning you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal, making it a good option for higher current contributions.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**: Evaluate between a Roth IRA (after-tax) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred). A Roth can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for money you may need access to before retirement. Taxes on capital gains and dividends can apply, so consider investments that generate qualified dividends to minimize tax impact.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Align your accounts based on your financial goals (retirement, education, etc.) and corresponding timelines. 
   - Longer-term investments (like retirement) may go into tax-advantaged accounts, while shorter-term goals could be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk**:
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to mitigate risk. Use tax-advantaged accounts for riskier growth investments and taxable accounts for more stable income-generating assets.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits for 401(k) ($22,500 for 2023) and IRA ($6,500 for 2023), adjusting your contributions accordingly.

5. **Employer Matches**:
   - Maximize any employer match in your 401(k) before redirecting funds elsewhere, as this is effectively free money.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Max out 401(k) contributions** to take full advantage of employer matching.
- **Contribute to IRAs** based on tax strategy (Roth vs. Traditional).
- **Allocate any remaining funds** to taxable accounts for flexibility and access.

This approach allows for a balanced, tax-efficient strategy tailored to your specific financial situation. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize your plan further.
