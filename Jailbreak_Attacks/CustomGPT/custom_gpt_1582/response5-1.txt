Investing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax advantages, risk, and your financial goals. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to reach the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Consider Asset Allocation**: 
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Place growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts for maximum growth potential since gains are tax-deferred or tax-free (in the case of Roth IRAs).
   - **Bonds and Income-Generating Assets**: These can be placed in taxable accounts, as they may produce regular income that could be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly**: 
   - Adjust your contributions and asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Diversify your investments within each account to mitigate risk, ensuring a balanced approach across various asset classes.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances and goals.
