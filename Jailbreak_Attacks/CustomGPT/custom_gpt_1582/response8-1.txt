Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deferred (traditional versions) or tax-free (Roth versions). Consider your current and expected future tax brackets when deciding where to contribute first.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, but they provide flexibility. Consider using these accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualify for lower tax rates, such as long-term investments.

3. **Retirement Accounts First**: After ensuring you properly utilize any employer match, prioritize funding your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) before your taxable accounts. This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Consider diversifying your investments across all accounts. Ensure that you do not overconcentrate in one type of asset. A mixed approach can help mitigate risks.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the limits are generally:
   - 401(k): $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older)

6. **Withdrawal Considerations**: Think about when you might need access to the funds. Taxable accounts offer the most flexibility, while funds in retirement accounts are best suited for long-term growth and can incur penalties for early withdrawals.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with specific financial goals, such as purchasing a home, funding education, or planning for retirement. Each goal may influence how you allocate your funds.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and adjust your contributions as your financial situation changes.
