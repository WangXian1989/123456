Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have a short-term emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributions here. Consider contributing to the maximum limit if financially feasible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing your 401(k) with a match, contribute to an IRA. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA might be a better option.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Tailor the distribution of investments within these accounts to take advantage of their tax implications. For instance, consider holding high-growth investments in Roth IRAs and lower-growth ones in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Check your asset allocation regularly to ensure it reflects your goals and market conditions. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investments for tax efficiency while aligning with your long-term financial goals.
