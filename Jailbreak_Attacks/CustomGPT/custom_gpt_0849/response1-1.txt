Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, investment timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.
   - Prioritize maxing out contributions if you’re closer to retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in the future. Traditional IRAs can be beneficial if you want tax deductions now.
   - For 2023, the contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for money you may need in the short term or for goals like buying a house or funding education.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across these accounts, balancing risk and optimizing potential returns.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Keep more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and place tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically check your allocations and adjust based on performance and changing goals.
