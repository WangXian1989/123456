Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially “free” money.
   - **Consider Investment Choices**: Look at the available investments and fees within your 401(k) plan. If it's a good plan with low fees and solid investment options, you might consider maxing this out first.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). This can depend on your current tax bracket versus expected future income.
   - **Contribute to the Limit**: If eligible, aim to contribute the maximum allowed each year, especially to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **After-Tax Savings**: Use taxable accounts to invest any additional savings after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA. This can provide liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversified across all accounts in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor might be beneficial for tailored advice.

Remember, the overall goal should be to maximize growth while managing risk and minimizing taxes. Each individual’s situation can vary, so consider your unique financial picture when making decisions.
