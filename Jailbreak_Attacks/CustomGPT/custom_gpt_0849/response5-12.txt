I'm not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for liver issues. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, quitting alcohol, and regular exercise. Medications may be prescribed depending on the specific liver condition, like antiviral drugs for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases. In severe cases, procedures or surgeries like liver transplants may be necessary.

For a more personalized approach, please see a doctor who can evaluate your situation and provide tailored recommendations.
