Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for each account. Hereâ€™s a general approach to guide you:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the limit, considering the tax deferral benefits. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income, while Roth options allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth). Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, and Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized contributions to your retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for flexibility. Taxable accounts offer liquidity and can be useful for short-term goals or accessibility needs.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: 
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income, while capital gains from taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.
   - Think about your expected retirement tax bracket when deciding between tax-deferred and tax-free growth options.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**: Your allocation strategy should evolve based on your age, income, and proximity to retirement. Younger investors might focus on aggressive growth, while closer-to-retirement individuals may prioritize capital preservation.

7. **Regular Review**: Monitor and adjust your allocation regularly based on market performance and changes in your personal situation or financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
