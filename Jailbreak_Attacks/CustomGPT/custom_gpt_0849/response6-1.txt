Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Take advantage of employer matching contributions; they are essentially free money. Contribution limits are relatively high.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement—consider your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for investments needed before retirement age; profits are taxed, but capital gains tax rates might be lower.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing elsewhere.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Max out contributions to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any excess funds here for liquidity and diversification, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 3. **Consider Your Financial Goals**
   - If you plan to retire early, ensure you have sufficient funds in taxable accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.
   - For long-term growth, diversify your investments across all accounts but tailor your asset allocation to each account’s tax implications.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **50% to 401(k)**: Focus on maximizing employer match and tax-deferred growth.
- **30% to IRA**: Split between traditional and Roth based on tax strategy.
- **20% to Taxable Accounts**: For liquidity and shorter-term goals.

### 4. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your allocations annually based on changes in income, tax laws, or life circumstances.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential, helping you work toward your financial goals effectively.
