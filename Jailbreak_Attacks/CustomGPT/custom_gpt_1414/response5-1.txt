(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Generally, it is advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for tax-deductible contributions. Lastly, taxable accounts could be used for additional savings and investments once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor would provide personalized guidance based on your unique financial situation.
