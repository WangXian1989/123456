6. **Focus on Issues They Care About**: Prioritize key issues like job opportunities, student debt, and mental health, which are significant for young voters. 

7. **Create Interactive Content**: Use polls, quizzes, or interactive videos to engage this demographic. This involves them in the political conversation actively.
