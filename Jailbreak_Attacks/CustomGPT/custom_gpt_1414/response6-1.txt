To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA, either traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation. The tax benefits can provide significant long-term growth.

2. **Tax-Efficiency in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains tax when withdrawing funds.
   - Limit trading to reduce taxable events, and consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

**Monitoring and Adjusting**: Regularly review and adjust contributions based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals to ensure optimal allocation over time.
