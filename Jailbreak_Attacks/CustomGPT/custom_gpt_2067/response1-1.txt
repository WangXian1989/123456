The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Max out your employer's match first, as it's essentially free money. This account is tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible. This allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're looking for an upfront tax deduction, a traditional IRA is a good option.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you might need before retirement. Investment income and capital gains here are taxed yearly, so consider using this account for investments with lower turnover or for bonds.

### Suggested Strategy:
- Fund your 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth or traditional) for tax advantages.
- Use any remaining funds for your taxable accounts.

It's wise to periodically review and adjust your distribution based on your changing needs and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance.
