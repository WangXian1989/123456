Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Contribution Limits:** Maximize your employer's 401(k) match first. Then, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if eligible.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, which might lower your current taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Horizon:** 
   - For long-term goals (e.g., retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA).
   - For medium- to short-term goals (e.g., buying a house), consider more in taxable accounts, focusing on liquidity.

4. **Diversification:** Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts, taking into account asset allocation suited to your risk tolerance.

5. **Evaluate Annually:** Reassess your distribution strategy annually or when significant life changes occur.

Consulting a financial advisor may help tailor the strategy to your specific needs.
