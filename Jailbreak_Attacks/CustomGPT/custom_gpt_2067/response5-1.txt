The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either traditional or Roth) since these accounts offer tax benefits.

3. **Tax Efficiency in Investment Selection**:
   - In your 401(k) and IRA, you can hold investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) without worrying about the immediate tax impact.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you plan to hold long-term (like stocks) to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Diversify Across Accounts**: Make sure to diversify your investments across all accounts while considering the tax implications of each account type.

5. **Adjust Contributions by Age**: As you near retirement, you may want to shift more into safer investments in your 401(k) and IRA, while your taxable accounts might still hold growth-oriented assets.

6. **Review Regularly**: Assess your asset allocation and performance regularly to ensure youâ€™re on track to meet your financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
