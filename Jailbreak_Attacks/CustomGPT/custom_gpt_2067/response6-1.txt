To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon
   - **Retirement Savings**: Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility.

### 2. Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the maximum to your 401(k) (especially if there's an employer match).
   - **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 3. Balance Between Account Types
   - **Tax Diversification**: Spread out investments across your accounts to minimize tax impact over time.
   - **Investment Choices**: Consider the types of investments; use your taxable account for investments that generate less frequent taxable events (like index funds).

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Periodically assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Key Considerations
- **Tax Implications**: Be aware of capital gains taxes on taxable accounts and required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.
- **Investment Type**: Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compounding.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 50%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 20%

By following this strategic approach, you can optimize your investment distribution to achieve your long-term financial goals.
