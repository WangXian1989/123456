Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA which may offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Tax-Efficient Investment in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds or ETFs, which have lower turnover and capital gains.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a high tax bracket, prioritizing tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) and traditional IRAs can be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider more Roth contributions.

4. **Balance Risk and Time Horizon:**
   - Short-term goals should be in more liquid, less volatile investments, while long-term goals can tolerate more risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For tailored advice based on your specific circumstances, consider a professional financial planner.

Keep in mind each individual's situation is unique, so it's essential to adapt these strategies to fit your needs.
