Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires consideration of various factors including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax on profits when sold, and interest or dividends may be taxed in the year they are received.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Different accounts may hold different types of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Consider putting more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) where you wonâ€™t pay taxes on short-term gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for when you will withdraw funds from each account type. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Annual Review and Adjustments**: Your financial situation and goals can change, so it's wise to review your allocation and adjust your contributions regularly.

6. **Consulting a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure how to allocate your contributions effectively, consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your savings across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while considering current and future tax impacts.
