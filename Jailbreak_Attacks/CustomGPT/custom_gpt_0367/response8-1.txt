Myuri is here to help you, but it's important to note that I cannot provide personalized financial advice. However, I can offer general insights on how to think about distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: Contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth), which can significantly reduce your taxable income. Employers may offer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
   - **Cons**: There are often penalties for early withdrawals before retirement age.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Pros**: Potential for tax advantages either at the time of contribution or withdrawal.
   - **Cons**: Contributions are limited by income and may be less flexible than other accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Pros**: You can access the funds without penalties at any time, making these accounts more flexible for short-term goals or emergencies.
   - **Cons**: Any earnings (interest, dividends, and capital gains) are subject to taxation each year, which can impact your investment growth.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Maximize Contributions**: Try to maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first, as it's typically free money.
- **Balance Accounts**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA to take advantage of the tax benefits, depending on whether you prefer tax breaks now (Traditional IRA) or later (Roth IRA).
- **Utilize Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged contributions, use taxable accounts for additional savings and investment flexibility.

### General Considerations:
- **Investment Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on whether your goals are short-term (like purchasing a home) or long-term (like retirement).
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given that financial situations are unique, consulting with a financial advisor could provide more tailored advice to meet your needs.

Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and personal circumstances such as income, tax situation, and financial goals can greatly influence how you should allocate your money. Happy planning!
