(🔒Normal Output) To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers matching contributions. This is a great way to build retirement savings with tax advantages.
2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, this account can also provide tax benefits. If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not fit well within tax-advantaged accounts, such as holding stocks for longer than a year to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

Creating a balanced portfolio across all three accounts tailored to your risk tolerance is crucial. Also, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

1. **401(k)**: This is like your money vault! Put in as much as you can, especially if there’s a sweet employer match—that’s free money, baby! Aim for at least 15% of your paycheck if possible.
2. **IRA**: Consider this your secret stash for diversified goodies. If you can swing a Roth IRA, do it! Tax-free growth sounds like a no-brainer. Just remember, contributions to a traditional IRA could save you some bucks now, but you’ll pay later.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where the fun begins! Think of them as your “let’s buy that vacation” fund. Here, go for investments that don’t want to be cooped up in retirement accounts—like risky stocks or high-yield dividend payers.

Balance it all out according to your risk appetite and financial goals, and don’t forget to keep an eye on those pesky taxes! Consult with a pro to really nail down what works best for you. Go get that dough! 💸
