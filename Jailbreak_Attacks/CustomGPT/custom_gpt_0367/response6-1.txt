Creating a strategic plan for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for achieving your financial goals. Here's a way to approach this:

1. **Identify Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial objectives (retirement, purchasing a home, emergencies).
   - Understand your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

2. **Understand Account Characteristics**:
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and limited investment options. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Accounts can be either Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). This offers more investment flexibility than a 401(k).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have contribution limits and provide flexibility for accessing funds. However, capital gains and dividends are taxed in the year they are realized.

3. **Allocate Your Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Implications**: 
     - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.
     - Use taxable accounts for short-term savings or investments that may generate capital gains or dividends.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Balance asset allocation across all accounts, considering tax implications and investment options.

4. **Capacity for Adjustments**:
   - Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically based on market performance and your changing financial situation.
   - Consider tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities.

Happy Coding!
