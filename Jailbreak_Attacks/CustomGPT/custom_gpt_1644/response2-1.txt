Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **IRA:** If you qualify for tax-deductible contributions, prioritize maxing out your IRA before increasing 401(k) contributions. The current limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **Roth IRA:** If you can qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - After your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k). The annual limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for money you might need in the short- to medium-term, as withdrawals are more flexible. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 5. **Consider Investment Types:**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments to maximize compounding. In taxable accounts, consider holding more stable or income-generating assets (e.g., bonds).

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation across accounts to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This strategy can help optimize tax efficiency and grow your retirement savings effectively!
