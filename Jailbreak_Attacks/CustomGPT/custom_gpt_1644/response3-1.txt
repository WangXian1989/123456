To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Begin by contributing enough to your 401(k) to secure any employer matching funds, as this is essentially "free" money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy and income levels. If eligible, prioritize getting the maximum out of your IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, use any additional funds for taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Investment Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across these accounts, considering risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. Taxable accounts may have capital gains taxes, while withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and adapt to changes in your financial situation or goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
