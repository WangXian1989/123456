To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any available employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Prioritize your 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions for tax-deferred growth. This allows your investments to grow without immediate tax implications.

3. **Roth Accounts:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate significant dividends or interest income. This way, you can manage the tax implications more effectively.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Tailor your asset allocation based on risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon across all accounts, considering the tax implications of each type.

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement to minimize taxes, such as withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts.

8. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting with a financial advisor to optimize your strategy based on your individual goals and circumstances.

This structured approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
