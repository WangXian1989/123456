Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to that next for tax-free growth. If not, a traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth. 

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After maximizing the match and your IRA contributions, continue contributing to your 401(k) to benefit from tax deferrals and additional employer contributions if available.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing both retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for investments to fund short-term goals or for flexibility, as these accounts are subject to capital gains tax but allow for more immediate access to funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account. 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals. Taxable accounts incur capital gains taxes.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment timeline to allocate your investments appropriately across all accounts. Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Review regularly**: Periodically assess your account performance and adjust contributions based on changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
