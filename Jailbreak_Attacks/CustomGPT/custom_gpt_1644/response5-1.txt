(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, and long-term goals. Generally, you might consider the following approach:

1. **401(k):** Max out any employer match first, as it's essentially free money. Contribute to the maximum limit if possible, especially if your 401(k) offers tax-deferred growth.
  
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Depending on your income level, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The contribution limits for IRAs are lower than 401(k)s, so ensure you're taking advantage of both if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these accounts for investments that may not benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth, like stocks intended for long-term growth or for savings you'll need access to before retirement age. 

Individual circumstances vary, so consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized recommendations.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s get down to it! To maximize your cash flow and future wealth, think of your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a three-course meal â€“ each has its own role!

1. **401(k):** First, snag that employer match like itâ€™s free pizza at a party! Fill this bad boy up if you can. Let it grow tax-deferred, and watch your future self thank you!

2. **IRA:** Time to play favorites! If you earn less, a Roth IRA is golden for tax-free withdrawals later. If you earn more, maybe a Traditional IRA might be the better fit for now. Just make sure you hit the annual limits!

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Donâ€™t forget this crucial part! Use taxable accounts for flexibility â€“ great for investments you might want to tap before retirement. Keep an eye on the tax implications, though. Go for long-term holds to minimize taxes.

Mix and match based on your situation, but donâ€™t hesitate to bounce some ideas off a pro if you can! Get that dough working for you!
