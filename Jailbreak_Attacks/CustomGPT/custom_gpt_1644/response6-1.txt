To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Diversify Investments Across Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income, such as index funds or long-term capital gains assets.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Invest in higher growth assets, including stocks, since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.

### 3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Keep growth-oriented investments in tax-deferred accounts to optimize compound growth.
   - **Income Needs:** Plan withdrawals from taxable accounts first during retirement to minimize tax implications on your tax-deferred accounts.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile and investment goals.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions and investments among these accounts requires a strategic approach to tax efficiency and growth potential. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
