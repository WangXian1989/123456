Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out traditional or Roth IRA contributions if you're eligible, as these accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance growth.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or qualified dividends, as they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

4. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**:
   - For long-term growth, favor stocks and equity funds in tax-advantaged accounts. 
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding fixed income or interest-generating investments that may not receive favorable tax treatment.

5. **Diversify**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation based on your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If in doubt, work with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.

By strategically distributing your funds, you can optimize growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
