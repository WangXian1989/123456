Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and the investment options available in each account. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Prioritize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Max Out IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA (maximum contribution limits). Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Maximize 401(k)**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if your employer's plan has good investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility for short-term goals or emergency funds and allow for investments that may benefit from favorable long-term capital gains rates.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, stocks are better placed in accounts with higher tax rates (like 401(k) and IRAs) due to their growth potential and tax deferral, while bonds might be better in taxable accounts to avoid higher taxation on interest income.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your specific needs.
