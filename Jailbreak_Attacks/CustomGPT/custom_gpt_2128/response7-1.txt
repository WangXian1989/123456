Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it’s essentially "free money."

2. **Fund the IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing IRA contributions, focus on fully funding your 401(k). This can offer higher contribution limits than IRAs.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out retirement accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This gives more flexibility for withdrawals but can be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred or tax-free growth, while holding lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**: Be mindful of investment fees in your 401(k) or IRA and choose low-cost options.

7. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and strategically placing investments, you can optimize your overall financial health for the long term.
