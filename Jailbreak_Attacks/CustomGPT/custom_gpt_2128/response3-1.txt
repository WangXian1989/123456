To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to receive the full employer match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Withdrawals are taxed (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth) after retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to 401(k); consider your current and expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (e.g., long-term capital gains, qualified dividends) to minimize tax impact.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This can help mitigate risk and improve returns.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your contributions with your financial goals, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Get personalized advice based on your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can distribute your money efficiently across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, optimizing for growth while minimizing taxes.

### Summary
Start with maximizing employer 401(k) match, then prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, consider tax implications, diversify, and re-evaluate your strategy regularly.
