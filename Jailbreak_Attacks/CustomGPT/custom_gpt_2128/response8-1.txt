Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Assess Tax Implications**: Use your taxable accounts for investments you might want to access before retirement. Consider tax efficiency—invest in index funds or ETFs that generate fewer capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify across accounts to manage tax liabilities. Balance your investments (stocks, bonds) according to your risk tolerance, regardless of account type.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation across accounts to ensure alignment with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: As retirement approaches, think about how you’ll withdraw funds. Generally, it may be best to withdraw from taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

Lastly, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
