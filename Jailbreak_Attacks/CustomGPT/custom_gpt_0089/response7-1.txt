Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Use this for long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions to benefit from tax advantages. Prioritize Roth if you expect higher taxes in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use for short-term goals or emergencies since it’s more liquid.
   - **Capital Gains Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications on investment gains. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Balanced Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k) for long-term growth**.
- **Contribute to an IRA for additional tax benefits**.
- Use **taxable accounts** for flexibility and to meet short-term financial goals.

**Review regularly** based on changes in income, retirement goals, or tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
