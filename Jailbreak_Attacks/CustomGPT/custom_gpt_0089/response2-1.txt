Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA/401(k)**: Consider maximizing contributions to these accounts first, as they offer tax deferral or tax-free growth (for Roth accounts).
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize this over Roth.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account before heavily investing.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Last**:
   - Fund taxable accounts with any surplus after maxing out retirement accounts. This allows more flexibility but comes with less favorable tax treatment on gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Position higher-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, where gains aren’t taxed until withdrawal (401(k) or Traditional IRA).
   - Use taxable accounts for lower-growth or income-producing investments (bonds, REITs) to minimize taxes on interest and dividends.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations annually to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial planner to tailor the strategy to your specific needs.

This balanced approach helps optimize growth while considering tax implications and liquidity.
