It's great to see you're thinking about how to allocate your investments! Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of each option with some pros and cons:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Pros**:
     - Often includes employer matching, which is essentially free money.
     - Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
     - High contribution limits compared to IRAs.
   - **Cons**:
     - Limited investment options compared to IRAs.
     - Early withdrawal penalties before 59½ unless you qualify for an exception.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Pros**:
     - More investment choices compared to a 401(k).
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible.
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (if rules are followed).
   - **Cons**:
     - Contribution limits are lower than a 401(k).
     - Income limits on Roth IRA contributions might apply.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Pros**:
     - No contribution limits or withdrawal penalties.
     - Greater flexibility for cash flow needs.
     - You can take advantage of long-term capital gains rates, which are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates.
   - **Cons**:
     - You will be taxed on dividends and interest earned in the year they are realized.
     - Less favorable tax treatment compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

**General Strategy**:
- **Maximize your 401(k)**: At least contribute enough to get the employer match. If you can contribute more, consider it based on your cash flow.
- **Fund your IRA**: Depending on your tax situation, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. If you're eligible for a Roth, it’s usually preferred for long-term growth.
- **After tax-advantaged accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional investing. This will provide you with flexibility for withdrawals and diversifying your investment types.

Ultimately, consider working with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your individual circumstances and goals. They can help you optimize your allocations based on your specific situation. Happy investing!
