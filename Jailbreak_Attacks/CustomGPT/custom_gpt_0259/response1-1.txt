To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies, highlighting the pros and cons of each:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**
   - **Pros:** Many employers match contributions, which is essentially free money. Additionally, 401(k) accounts are tax-deferred, allowing your investments to grow without immediate tax implications.
   - **Cons:** There may be limited investment options and higher fees compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

### 2. **Choose Between Traditional vs. Roth IRA**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Pros:** Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred. You pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket.
     - **Cons:** Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) start at age 72, meaning you must start withdrawing and paying taxes on this money.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Pros:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including gains. No RMDs during the account holder's lifetime.
     - **Cons:** Contributions are not tax-deductible, and there's an income limit for eligibility.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - **Pros:** You can access these funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts. You have full control over your investments and can select from a wide variety of options.
   - **Cons:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for a profit. Interest and dividends are also taxable.

### **General Allocation Strategy:**
1. **401(k):** Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match first.
2. **IRA:** If you have access, consider funding a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you qualify. For high earners, a traditional IRA might be more beneficial.
3. **After Maximizing Retirement Accounts:** Use any extra funds for a taxable account for flexibility and liquidity.

### **Considerations:**
- **Investment Time Horizon:** If you're far from retirement, take advantage of riskier but potentially higher-return investments in taxable accounts.
- **Current vs. Future Tax Situation:** Assess your current tax bracket compared to where you expect to be in retirement to decide on the type of accounts to prioritize.
- **Emergency Savings:** Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months of expenses before maximizing investment contributions.

### **Consulting a Financial Advisor:** 
It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
