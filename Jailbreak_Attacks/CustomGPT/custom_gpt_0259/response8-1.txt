Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Often comes with employer matching contributions, which is essentially free money.
     - Contributions reduce your taxable income, potentially lowering your tax bill.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited investment options depending on your employer’s plan.
     - Early withdrawal penalties before age 59½.

### 2. **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA):**
   - **Traditional IRA:**
     - **Pros:** Tax-deductible contributions lower your taxable income, and your investments grow tax-deferred.
     - **Cons:** Same early withdrawal penalties as a 401(k), and you'll have to pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA:**
     - **Pros:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (if conditions are met).
     - **Cons:** Income limits may restrict contributions for high earners.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Pros:**
     - No contribution limits or penalties for withdrawal, providing flexibility.
     - Capital gains tax rates can be lower than ordinary income tax rates if investments are held long-term.
   - **Cons:**
     - You will owe taxes on any dividends or interest earned, as well as on capital gains when you sell investments.

### **Recommended Distribution Strategy:**
1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
   - Max out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth) if eligible after your 401(k) match.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider using a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments meant for short-term goals or for emergencies.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.) tailored to your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly assess your investments and rebalance, aligning with changes to your financial situation or goals.

### Conclusion:
The best distribution will vary for individuals, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific circumstances. Happy investing!
