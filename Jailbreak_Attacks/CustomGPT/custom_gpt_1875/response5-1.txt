To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation and income level.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings or investments once you've maxed out your retirement accounts.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-deferred Accounts:** Focus on growing funds in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) first, as you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider municipal bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

### 3. **Investment Choices:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Choose a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use strategies like tax-loss harvesting to manage taxes on gains and maintain a diversified portfolio.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan the order of withdrawals in retirement. Generally, tap taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize taxes over time.

Always assess your specific financial situation, potential tax implications, and retirement goals. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts will help you maximize growth, manage taxes effectively, and achieve your long-term financial goals.
