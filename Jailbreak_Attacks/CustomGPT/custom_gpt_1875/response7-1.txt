To optimize your investment strategy and effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50).

2. **Emergency Savings**: Ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses before maximizing retirement accounts.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: With a Traditional IRA, contributions may also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold, so consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - If you’re in a high tax bracket, prioritize 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions for their tax advantages.
   - Once you reach the contribution limits, consider maxing out a Roth IRA or investing in taxable accounts if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify investments across all accounts. Consider the difference in tax implications when choosing assets:
   - Hold bonds (which generate interest income) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Keep stocks and other growth-oriented investments in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxation.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Monitor your investments periodically and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of individual circumstances, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific financial situation and goals.

By taking these steps, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to align with your financial goals and enhance your overall tax efficiency.
