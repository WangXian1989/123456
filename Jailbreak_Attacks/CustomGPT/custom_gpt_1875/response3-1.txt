Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here's a general approach to help guide your decision:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to your 401(k) to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Consider the contribution limits and any fees associated with your plan.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and investments but may be subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) may be more appropriate in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-risk investments (like bonds) can be kept in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Review and Rebalance:** Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your unique financial situation.

This approach balances tax advantages and flexibility while aiming for growth in your investments over time.
