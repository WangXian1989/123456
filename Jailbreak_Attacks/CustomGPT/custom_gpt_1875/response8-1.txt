To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching contributions first. This is essentially “free money” and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After securing your employer match, focus on maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) contributions. The IRA often offers tax benefits depending on your income and tax situation.
   - Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Familiarize yourself with contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 for those over 50). The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, you can contribute to taxable accounts. This flexibility allows you to use funds for goals beyond retirement without penalty for early withdrawals.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and goals. Consider holding more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where growth isn't taxed until withdrawal) and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to limit tax exposure on interest income.

6. **Periodic Reassessment**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and changing financial goals. This will help you stay on track towards your retirement objectives.

7. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be strategic about withdrawals in retirement to minimize tax liabilities. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to grow tax-deferred.

8. **Consult Financial Advisors**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

By balancing contributions across these accounts, you'll position yourself for a more secure financial future.
