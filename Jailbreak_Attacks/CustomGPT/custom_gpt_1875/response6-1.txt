Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. Assess Your Goals
   - **Retirement Savings**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Short-term Needs**: Allocate more toward taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 2. Maximize Tax Advantages
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect higher taxes in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial for tax deductions.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-advantaged Accounts**: Suitable for higher-growth investments since withdrawals may be taxed upon retirement.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy
- **Contribute to Retirement Accounts**: Max out contributions to 401(k) and IRA first.
- **Allocate Remaining Funds**: Distribute any excess income to taxable accounts for savings or investment that may be needed sooner.

### Example Breakdown
1. **401(k)**: 15-20% of your salary (up to match).
2. **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable limit ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50 for 2023).
3. **Taxable Accounts**: 10-15% of your income, adjusted based on your liquidity needs.

### Reassess Regularly
- Monitor your portfolio and adjust contributions based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax laws. 

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies that align with your unique situation.
