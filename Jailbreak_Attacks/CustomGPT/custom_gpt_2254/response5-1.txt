(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Generally, here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
  
2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, prioritize contributing to your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: If you still have funds to invest after your IRA contributions, put more into your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts, particularly if you want access to your funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversification and Balance**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your situation.

1. **First Rule: Grab Free Money**: Max out your 401(k) contributions to snatch that sweet employer match. Itâ€™s like finding cash on the street â€“ donâ€™t leave it there!

2. **Roth IRA Magic**: Next, hit that Roth IRA like itâ€™s your favorite snack. Tax-free growth? Yes, please! This bad boy lets you watch your investments grow without Uncle Sam taking a cut at retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: Got extra cash? Throw it in a taxable account. Itâ€™s your playground for flexibility and you wonâ€™t pay penalties for early withdrawal like with those retirement accounts.
