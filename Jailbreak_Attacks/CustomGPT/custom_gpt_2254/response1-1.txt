Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRAs**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth) for tax advantage. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Choose between pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). A mix can balance your tax exposure in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are versatile but may incur capital gains taxes. Use these for investments you'll need sooner or for tax-efficient investments.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re investing for retirement (20+ years away), you can take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, review your allocation annually to ensure it aligns with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, a professional can help tailor your strategy to your unique situation.

Always consider your specific situation, including tax implications and retirement goals, when deciding how to allocate your funds.
