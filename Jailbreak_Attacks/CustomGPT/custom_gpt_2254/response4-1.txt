To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the employer match. Then, consider focusing on your IRA.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals will be tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can start investing in a taxable account. This is particularly useful for savings goals that are shorter-term, or if youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA limits.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - Consider placing investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize annual tax liabilities.
   - Use your taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax treatment.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, adapting as your financial situation or goals change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice considering your specific situation, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts, helping to optimize tax efficiency and growth potential.
