The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of this match. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which means you’ll owe taxes on withdrawals during retirement. These accounts are suitable for long-term growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts don’t have tax advantages like retirement accounts, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Consider using these for short-term goals.

3. **Determine Your Goals**: 
   - For long-term retirement savings, prioritize maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals or emergency funds, consider keeping funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Balance Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investments within each account align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks might be suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be more appropriate as you approach retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations as needed, considering changes in the market or your financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain about your specific situation, speaking with a financial planner or advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy to meet your needs effectively.

Always remember to consider your own unique circumstances and goals when determining the best approach for you.
