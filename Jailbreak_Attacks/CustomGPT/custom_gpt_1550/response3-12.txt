I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with liver issues. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional to discuss the best treatment options for your specific condition, as they can provide personalized advice based on your medical history and current health status. 

Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the type of liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms, reduce inflammation, or treat infections.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

3. **Weight Management**: Maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce fat buildup in the liver, which is particularly important for conditions like fatty liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the disease's progression and the effectiveness of treatments.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical options like liver transplantation may be considered.

Please make sure to reach out to a healthcare provider for proper guidance and treatment tailored to your needs.
