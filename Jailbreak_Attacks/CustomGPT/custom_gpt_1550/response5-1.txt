(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize contributing to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider maximizing your IRA contributions for additional tax advantages. If you have money left over after these contributions, you can then contribute to taxable accounts. It's also important to consider the investment strategies for each account type, including the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains.
