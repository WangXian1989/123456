Treatment options for liver problems may vary depending on the specific condition, but common approaches include lifestyle modifications, medications, and in some cases, surgical interventions. It's important to get a comprehensive evaluation to determine the best course of action for your situation. Please seek advice from a qualified medical professional for accurate information and treatment options.
