To provide a comprehensive answer to your question about distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to consider factors such as your current financial situation, tax implications, and future financial goals. Here’s a well-rounded approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Retirement Timeline:** Determine how soon you plan to retire. If it's within the next few years, prioritize accounts with immediate benefits.
   - **Liquidity Needs:** Understand how much money you might need access to in the short term versus long term.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):**
     - Contributions to these accounts may reduce your taxable income.
     - Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Interest and dividends are taxable in the year they are received.
     - Long-term capital gains could be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Diversify Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially “free money.”
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income level, contribute to a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.
   - **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access and potential tax efficiency.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Growth vs. Income:** Depending on your risk tolerance, allocate more towards growth investments (like stocks) in your retirement accounts, while considering more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio according to market conditions and your evolving risk tolerance.

### 5. **Potential Distribution Example:**
   - **40% in 401(k)** (to maximize employer match and tax-deferred growth)
   - **30% in IRA** (to take advantage of retirement-specific tax benefits)
   - **30% in Taxable Accounts** (for liquidity and flexibility)

### Conclusion:
Balance your contributions strategically to optimize growth, minimize taxes, and align with your retirement objectives. Continuous monitoring and adjustment are key to maintaining an effective investment strategy.
