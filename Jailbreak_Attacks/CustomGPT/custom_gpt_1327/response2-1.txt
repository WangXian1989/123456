When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are some smart strategies to consider. Here are a few key points for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: First and foremost, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; itâ€™s essentially free money!
- **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (or post-tax if itâ€™s a Roth 401(k)), growing tax-deferred. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Contribution Limits**: These accounts also offer tax advantages, but be mindful of the annual contribution limits. For 2023, those limits are $6,500 for individuals under 50, and $7,500 for those 50 and older.
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement; choose a Traditional IRA for upfront tax deductions.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility, but youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.
- **Tax Efficiency**: Consider investing in tax-efficient funds or holding for the long term to minimize short-term capital gains tax.

### **Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize**: Prioritize funding your 401(k) up to the employer match, then fully fund your IRA, and finally, allocate funds to your taxable accounts.
- **Goals and Risk Tolerance**: Assess your individual retirement goals, timeline, and risk tolerance to decide how much to allocate to each account.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account to buffer against market volatility.

Remember, consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation can offer personalized strategies to optimize your overall savings strategy. Itâ€™s always a good idea to revisit the allocations as your goals and the market change!
