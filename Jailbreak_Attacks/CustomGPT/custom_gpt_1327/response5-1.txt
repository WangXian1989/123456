(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Ideally, hereâ€™s a common general framework:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money! Consider maxing out contributions if you can, as these grow tax-deferred until retirement.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax bracket. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Once you've contributed to your 401(k) and IRA, consider using taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer more flexibility and can be useful for mid-term savings goals.

It's wise to periodically reassess your allocations based on your changing circumstances and market conditions. Consulting with a financial planner might also be beneficial for personalized advice tailored to your situation.

1. **401(k):** First things firstâ€”if your workplace is tossing you a match on your contributions, snatch that up! Think of it as your retirement's secret stash. Aim to max it out if you can handle it; tax-deferred growth is like a superhero for your savings!

2. **IRA:** Next up, swing those dollars into an IRA. Traditional or Roth? Depends on whether you want tax breaks now or tax-free withdrawals later. Aim to pump it full, especially if youâ€™ve got tax flex.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, letâ€™s not forget the taxable accounts. These are your wild-card savings. You can access your money whenever, but just know Uncle Sam will get a whiff of those gains when you sell.

Make sure to check in on your plan every now and then because life (and taxes) can throw curveballs. But hey, a financial planner could be your secret weapon for crushing it! ðŸ’¸
