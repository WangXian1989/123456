When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it really depends on your financial goals, your tax situation, and your timeline for needing those funds. Here are some general guidelines you might consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, that's often the best place to start. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money. Also, consider your investment options within the 401(k) and make sure they align with your risk tolerance and goals.

2. **IRA:** An IRA can offer tax advantages, especially if you go for a Roth IRA where withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. If you're eligible for a Roth, itâ€™s a great way to grow your money without the tax burden later. If tax deductions are more valuable for you now, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are great for flexibility. You'll pay taxes on any gains here but can access the funds without penalties. This can be a good place for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates or if you think you'll need to access the money before retirement.

**General Strategy:**
- Prioritize getting the full match in your 401(k).
- Maximize your IRA contributions if you're eligible.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investments once youâ€™ve maxed out the tax-advantaged options.

Make sure to reassess your allocations periodically based on your retirement goals and any changes in your financial situation. It might also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor tailored to your personal circumstances!
