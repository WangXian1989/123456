Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Max Out Retirement Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. Prioritize Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate significant short-term capital gains, or for money you'll need before retirement. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

3. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger individuals may afford to take more risks in stocks within retirement accounts. As you age, consider shifting towards more conservative investments.

4. **Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have enough in taxable accounts for emergency expenses without penalties. 

5. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts. 

6. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and life changes.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation and goals.
