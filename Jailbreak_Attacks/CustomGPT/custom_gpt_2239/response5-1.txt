To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then focus on maxing out your IRA if eligible. 401(k)s are tax-deferred, which means you won't pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, you’ll want to consider your tax situation. Traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 

2. **Investment Types**:
   - Hold high-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - Reserve lower-growth and income-generating assets (like bonds or real estate investment trusts) for your taxable account to benefit from tax-efficient withdrawal strategies.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of annual contribution limits. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50). Ensure you’re maximizing these options before putting additional funds in taxable accounts.

4. **Retirement Timeline**:
   - Consider your time horizon. If retirement is far off, prioritize growth through your 401(k) and IRA. As retirement approaches, shift towards more conservative investments and start utilizing taxable accounts for withdrawals.

5. **Flexibility Needs**:
   - Keep in mind that taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be advantageous if you need funds before retirement age.

Overall, a balanced approach focusing on tax efficiency, growth potential, and your retirement goals will help in effectively distributing your funds. It's also advisable to consult a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
