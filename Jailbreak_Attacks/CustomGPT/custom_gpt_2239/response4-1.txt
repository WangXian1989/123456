Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to max out your tax-advantaged accounts (like your IRA) before putting money into taxable accounts. This helps reduce your taxable income and provides tax-deferred growth.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your investment choices in each account. Typically, you'll want to hold higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (which shield you from taxes) and income-generating investments in taxable accounts (to minimize tax impacts).

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals from these accounts in retirement. Generally, youâ€™ll want to take from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k)), and lastly from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Rebalance as Necessary**: Keep an eye on your allocations and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax implications and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations suited to your situation.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to managing your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
