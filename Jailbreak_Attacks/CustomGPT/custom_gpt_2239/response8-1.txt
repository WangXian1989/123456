Balancing your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for long-term financial health. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out this account first for its tax benefits.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you’ve maxed out contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts, invest excess funds in taxable accounts.
   - Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and age. Younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement should consider bonds.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk appetite.

6. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from your accounts, especially with traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, which are taxed as ordinary income.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation is also a wise step.
