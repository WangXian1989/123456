Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement (ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later).
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient assets like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund outside these accounts, ideally covering 3-6 months of expenses.

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Within each account type, diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider more aggressive options in the 401(k) or IRA for long-term growth, as they are tax-advantaged.

6. **Continuous Assessments**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and performance.

By prioritizing contributions based on tax efficiency and your personal situation, you can effectively optimize your investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor is also advisable to create a personalized plan.
