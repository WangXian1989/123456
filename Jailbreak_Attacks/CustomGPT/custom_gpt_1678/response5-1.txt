The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax contributions, reducing your taxable income. Later, distributions will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, contributions are made with post-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use them for investments that may generate capital gains; long-term gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your distribution based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Keep some funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or upcoming expenses, as they can be accessed without penalties.

6. **Plan for Retirement**: As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting more funds to safer investments within your 401(k) and IRA to preserve capital.
