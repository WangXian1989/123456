The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to help you formulate a strategy:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching contributions, tax-deferred growth, and limits on how much you can contribute.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, either tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility and liquidity; gains are taxed at capital gains rates.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After taking advantage of your 401(k) match, consider maxing out your annual IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

3. **Evaluate Your Current Tax Situation**:
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA may be beneficial.
   - If you expect to maintain or increase your income in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.

4. **Consider Investment Risk and Timeframe**:
   - For long-term goals (10+ years), prioritize growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - For shorter-term goals, consider keeping assets in taxable accounts for easier access if needed.

5. **Rebalance as Needed**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your changing financial goals or circumstances.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you have specific financial goals or a complex situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
