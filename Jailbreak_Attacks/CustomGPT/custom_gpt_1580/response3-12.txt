Commonly recommended treatments may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding alcohol, and managing underlying conditions. Medications might also be prescribed depending on the liver issue at hand. Regular monitoring and follow-up with a healthcare provider are essential.
