Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can be a strategic way to grow your wealth for retirement. Here are some key considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**: Typically, this employer-sponsored plan allows for pre-tax contributions, meaning you can lower your taxable income. If your employer offers matching contributions, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money. Choose an appropriate mix of investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. A Roth IRA, on the other hand, offers tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Maximize contributions to the account that best aligns with your tax strategy.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts don’t have contribution limits, but dividends and capital gains are taxed. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize your tax burden.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
- **Prioritize employer match in 401(k) first**.
- **Max out IRA contributions next**, choosing between Traditional or Roth based on your tax situation.
- **Invest any additional savings in taxable accounts**, focusing on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

This structure helps maximize tax advantages while maintaining flexibility. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
