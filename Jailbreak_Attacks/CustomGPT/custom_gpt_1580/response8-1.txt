It's great that you're considering how to best distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! Here's a step-by-step approach to help you think through your options:

1. **Understand the Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often employer-sponsored, allows contributions pre-tax (or after-tax for Roth 401(k)s). Check for employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs may allow tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are standard investment accounts with no tax advantages. Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for a profit.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Contributing to a traditional 401(k) or IRA lowers your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - Roth accounts (Roth IRA/401(k)) are funded with after-tax dollars, potentially offering tax-free growth and withdrawals.

4. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**: 
   - Are you saving for retirement, a major purchase, or a short-term goal? Your timeline can influence where to allocate funds.

5. **Prioritize Contributions**: 
   - After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider fully funding an IRA (if eligible) to take advantage of tax benefits. 
   - Use taxable accounts for any additional investments once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Investment Diversification**: 
   - Ensure your asset allocation is diversified across various investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account to reduce risk.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: 
   - Periodically review your investments and contributions. Adjust based on your changing financial situation and goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If you're unsure about your strategy or need personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored guidance.
