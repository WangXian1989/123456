To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Invest in Tax-Advantaged Funds:** Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds for long-term growth.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):**
   - **Determine Eligibility:** Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) based on your current tax situation.
   - **Max Contribution:** Contribute the maximum allowed annually for long-term benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Access:** Utilize these accounts for short- to medium-term goals (like buying a home or traveling).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

4. **Overall Allocation Strategy:**
   - **Diversification:** Balance your portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust the risk based on your financial goals, age, and time horizon.

5. **Review Regularly:**
   - Reassess your strategy periodically, especially after major life events or market changes.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
