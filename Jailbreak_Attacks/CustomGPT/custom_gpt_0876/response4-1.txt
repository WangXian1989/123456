Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments you'll need access to before retirement, as they have different tax treatment on dividends and capital gains.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate funds across assets (stocks, bonds) within each account type to reduce risk.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - Funds in retirement accounts generally should be more aggressive because theyâ€™re meant for long-term growth.
   - Adjust your asset allocation based on how close you are to retirement.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Monitor and adjust your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have adequate liquidity in your taxable accounts for unexpected expenses instead of relying solely on retirement accounts.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your individual situation and ensure compliance with IRS rules.
