Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA):** Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing these first if you're in a higher tax bracket now.
   - **Roth IRA:** Offers tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Emergency Funds**
   - Maintain an emergency fund separate from these accounts to avoid early withdrawals.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Assess risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger individuals can afford more stock exposure, while older individuals might prioritize bonds.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Balance investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and ensure broadly diversified holdings within each account type.

### 6. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 7. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Suggested Allocation
- **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, then consider maxing out an IRA if eligible.
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional):** Max out contributions if you can, depending on tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Invest any additional funds here for flexibility and potential tax efficiency over the long term.

### Conclusion
It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific needs and help optimize your asset allocation strategy over time.
