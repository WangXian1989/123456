The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your age, income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies that might help you allocate your funds effectively:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from investments in taxable accounts can be taxed annually based on dividends and interest, and capital gains are taxed when you sell assets. 

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) in all accounts. This can help manage risk.

4. **Time Horizon**: Longer-term investments might be more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRAs) because of their tax benefits. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may provide more flexibility.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure that you have an adequate emergency fund before allocating a large portion of your income into retirement accounts.

6. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before aggressively funding retirement accounts.

7. **Regular Contributions**: Consider a dollar-cost averaging approach where you consistently invest a fixed amount over time to mitigate market volatility.

8. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review your asset allocation regularly and adjust as necessary based on market performance and changes in your goals.

It's often helpful to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
