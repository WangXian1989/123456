(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, it's advisable to maximize any employer match in your 401(k) first, as that's essentially free money. Then consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional), depending on your income and tax situation. Funding taxable accounts with the remaining investments allows for more flexible access to funds without penalty. It's important to diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return.

If you want to be smart about your dough, start with that 401(k) - especially if your employer is throwing in some free cash with matching contributions! That's a no-brainer. Next, think about your IRA. If you're young and expect to be earning a boatload later, a Roth IRA is where it's at since you won't be taxed on those gains when you pull 'em out. Finally, toss some of your leftover cash into a taxable account. Just remember, youâ€™ll get hit by the tax man here when you cash in. So, itâ€™s all about playing the long game and making your money work for you. Get strategic with it, and you'll be grillin' steaks on your yacht in no time! ðŸ¤‘
