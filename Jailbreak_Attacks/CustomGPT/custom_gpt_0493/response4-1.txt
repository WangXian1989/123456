When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors such as your current financial situation, tax implications, retirement goals, and investment preferences come into play. Here are some general strategies for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts:**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this, as it's essentially free money.
   - **High Contribution Limits:** 401(k) accounts have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. Max out your contributions if possible, especially if you're in your peak earning years.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA Accounts:** 
   - **Traditional vs. Roth:** Decide whether a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax) is best for you based on your current and expected future tax rates. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be preferable.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs, which are lower than 401(k)s. Aim to maximize your contributions, especially if you have room after funding your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexible Withdrawals:** Utilize taxable accounts for investments you may need access to before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax-efficient investments like ETFs or index funds, which may have lower capital gains liabilities.
   - **Investment Diversification:** Use taxable accounts to hold investments that may not benefit from tax-deferred growth (e.g., real estate investment trusts - REITs) or for diversification in your asset allocation.

4. **General Strategy:**
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses in a liquid savings account before making large investments.
   - **Debt Management:** Pay off any high-interest debt first, as the return on paying down debt is often greater than potential investment returns.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Your overall asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals. The allocation could be a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:** Periodically reassess your allocations as your financial situation, market conditions, and goals change.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
