Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k) Contributions:** 
   - If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - Consider maxing out your contributions if possible, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket, as it can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions on contributions, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax bracket.
   - The annual contribution limits for both types of IRAs can guide how much you allocate here.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - These accounts are more flexible for withdrawals and have no contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement (e.g., which accounts to tap first) as this can influence how you allocate your investments now.

Overall, it's often advised to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
