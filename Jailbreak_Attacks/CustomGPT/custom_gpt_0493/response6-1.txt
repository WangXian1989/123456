To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize IRA Contributions:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth; otherwise, a traditional IRA can also offer tax benefits.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to take advantage of lower tax rates.
   - **Hold High-Return, Taxed Income Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Keep bonds or REITs in your 401(k) or IRA to defer taxes on interest income.

3. **Considerations for Withdrawals:**
   - **Plan for Future Tax Implications:** Anticipate your tax situation at withdrawal; a balanced approach might involve withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to grow longer.

4. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - **Reassess Your Strategy Periodically:** Your financial situation and tax laws change, necessitating a review of your asset allocation among these accounts to optimize growth and minimize tax burdens.

Implementing these strategies allows for a well-rounded approach to growing your retirement funds efficiently while considering tax implications.
