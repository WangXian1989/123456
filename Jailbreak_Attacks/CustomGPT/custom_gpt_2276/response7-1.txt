Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to qualify for the full match. It’s essentially free money! Beyond that, consider your contribution limits and whether your plan offers good investment options.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA (either traditional or Roth) if you’re eligible. Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be very advantageous depending on your tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. This might be beneficial if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement age, as both 401(k)s and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Your investment choices within these accounts should align with your risk tolerance and timeline. For longer-term accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, you might opt for a more aggressive mix of stocks. In a taxable account, consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize tax liabilities on capital gains.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investments across all accounts to ensure your asset allocation remains aligned with your goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific situation for more personalized guidance.
