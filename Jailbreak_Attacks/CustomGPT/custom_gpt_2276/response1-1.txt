To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategic steps:

1. **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer match first. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing the employer match, put money into your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax strategy). Contributions to these accounts can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt:** If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider prioritizing paying that down before investing further, as the interest on that debt may outweigh potential investment gains.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** After funding retirement accounts, if you have surplus cash, consider investing in taxable accounts. They allow for more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

6. **Revisit Regularly:** Life changes; reassess your distribution strategy at least annually to ensure it still aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a tailored strategy that meets your specific circumstances.
