Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.

2. **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can be a great way to grow tax-free, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investing once you've maxed out contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts. This might be beneficial for short-term goals or if you want more liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Generally, you might want to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts from capital gains.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. Interest from bonds and certain dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates in taxable accounts, while long-term capital gains and qualified dividends can benefit from lower tax rates.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Professional**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always remember to evaluate your personal circumstances and adjust this strategy accordingly!
