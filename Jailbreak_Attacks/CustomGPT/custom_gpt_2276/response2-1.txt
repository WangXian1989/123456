Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once you've captured the match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. A Roth IRA has tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Return to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions (if possible), return to your 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit. This account often has higher contribution limits than an IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for mid-term goals, though you’ll need to manage potential taxes on capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within each account to align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments (like stocks) can be held in tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments could go in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Review your asset allocation and contribution strategy annually to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.
