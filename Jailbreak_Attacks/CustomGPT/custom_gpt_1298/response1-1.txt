When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, since they provide tax benefits. Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are tax-deferred, while withdrawals are taxed as income. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: 
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account before heavily investing in taxable accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: 
   - Allocate risk based on your age and risk tolerance. Generally, riskier assets (like stocks) can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments (like bonds) may fit well in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and adhere to changing personal circumstances or market conditions.

6. **Long-Term Perspective**: 
   - Focus on long-term growth and donâ€™t react impulsively to market fluctuations.
