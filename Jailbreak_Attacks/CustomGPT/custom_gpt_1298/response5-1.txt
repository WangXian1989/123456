Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Good for pre-tax or Roth contributions, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRA provides tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free growth. Consider maxing out a Roth if you qualify.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Ideal for short-term goals or after-tax investments. Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment (like index funds or ETFs).

3. **Diversification and Fees**: Balance investments across accounts to achieve diversification. Lower-fee options are typically better, especially in retirement accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different tax implications.

5. **Regular Review**: Reassess your strategy regularly based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
