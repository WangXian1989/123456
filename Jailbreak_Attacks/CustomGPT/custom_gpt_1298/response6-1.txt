Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, financial goals, and tax situation. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Contributions:** Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now, while Roth accounts give tax-free growth and withdrawals later.
   - **Withdrawals:** Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement to decide where to focus your contributions.

### 3. **Emergency Fund Consideration**
   - Ensure you have adequate liquid savings (in taxable accounts) for emergencies without needing to withdraw from retirement accounts, which could incur penalties.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Balance your investments across all accounts to maintain a diversified portfolio, but adjust for the tax implications of each account type.

### Conclusion
Aim to strike a balance that aligns with your immediate cash flow needs while maximizing growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts.
