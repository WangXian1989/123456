I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, common treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications (less fat, more fruits and vegetables), regular exercise, and weight management.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may help manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).
3. **Management of Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes, high cholesterol, or alcohol dependency.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track your liver health.
5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgery or interventions like liver transplantation may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional to get personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
