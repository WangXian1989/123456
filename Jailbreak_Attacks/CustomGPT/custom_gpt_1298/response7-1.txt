To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like ETFs or index funds) and hold higher-growth or riskier assets in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your future withdrawals to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawals from taxable accounts may be preferred before tax-advantaged ones to allow continued tax-deferred growth.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts. Prioritize tax-loss harvesting to offset gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Review your allocation periodically to maintain your desired risk level, adjusting contributions as needed.

By following these steps, you can optimize your asset allocation for long-term growth and tax efficiency while ensuring you're prepared for retirement.
