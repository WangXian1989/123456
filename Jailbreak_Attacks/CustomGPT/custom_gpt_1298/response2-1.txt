To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for higher contribution limits and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, particularly if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Asset Location**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (e.g., bonds, REITs) here, as they are taxed at your regular rate.
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Hold high-growth stocks or funds in these accounts to maximize tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Check your asset allocation periodically and rebalance to maintain your investment strategy.

6. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re young and can afford to take risks, you might prioritize aggressive growth in your tax-advantaged accounts.

Ultimately, tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. A consultation with a financial advisor could also provide personalized guidance.
