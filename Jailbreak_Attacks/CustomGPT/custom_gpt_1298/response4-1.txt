Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if offered. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maxing out contributions up to the annual limit (e.g., $22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023).
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for more flexible investments or if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Typically, invest in a diversified mix of stocks and bonds to optimize growth while considering your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Regular Reassessment**: Review and adjust your allocation regularly based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

This strategy balances growth potential, tax efficiency, and risk management while preparing for retirement. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
