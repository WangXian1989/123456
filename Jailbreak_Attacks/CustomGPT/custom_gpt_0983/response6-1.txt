To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

### 1. Tax Efficiency:
   - **401(k):** Prioritize contributions here for pre-tax benefits, especially if your employer matches.
   - **IRA:** Use for tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Focus on investments that generate long-term capital gains and qualified dividends to minimize taxes.

### 2. Liquidity Needs:
   - **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have sufficient liquidity for emergencies instead of relying on retirement accounts.
   - **Future Expenses:** Anticipate needs like buying a home or funding education.

### 3. Investment Goals:
   - **Retirement Horizon:** Longer horizons can lean more heavily on equity investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Adjust allocations based on how much risk you can comfortably take.

### Recommendations:
- **Maximize 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **Fund IRA:** If eligible, make full contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Balance Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that can afford to be taxed, aiming for growth and income.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Account:** 20%

Regularly review and adjust your strategy based on changes in tax laws, market conditions, and financial goals.
