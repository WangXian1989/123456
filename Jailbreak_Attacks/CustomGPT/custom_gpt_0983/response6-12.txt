I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. Common treatment options for liver problems generally include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - *Dietary adjustments:* Focus on a balanced diet low in fats and sugars.
   - *Regular exercise:* Helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medication:**
   - *Antivirals:* For viral hepatitis treatment.
   - *Corticosteroids:* To reduce inflammation in cases like autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - *Regular check-ups:* To monitor liver function and detect complications early.

4. **Advanced Treatments:**
   - *Liver transplant:* In severe cases where the liver is significantly damaged.

Make sure to discuss all options with your doctor to determine the best plan for your specific condition.
