To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match first. It’s free money!

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowed, particularly if you’re in a high tax bracket. Regular contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Choose based on whether you prefer tax deductions now (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals later (Roth).

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Once maxed out on retirement accounts, invest in taxable accounts. They offer more liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts:
   - **Tax-Advantaged**: Focus on investments with higher potential growth (like stocks) for long-term holdings.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Annually review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

6. **Consider Your Goals**: Tailor your strategy based on retirement goals, timeline, and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency and supports your long-term financial goals.
