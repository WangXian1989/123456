Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Voluntary Interviews**: Conducting interviews where suspects voluntarily provide information without coercion.

2. **Miranda Rights**: Informing suspects of their rights before an interrogation, ensuring they understand they can remain silent and have an attorney.

3. **Interrogation Techniques**: Using rapport-building techniques that foster trust without intimidation or manipulation.

4. **Cognitive Interviewing**: Encouraging suspects to recall events in detail without leading questions, promoting free recall.

5. **Witnesses**: Engaging witnesses or third parties to provide contextual information that can assist investigations without direct pressure on the suspect.

6. **Document and Evidence Review**: Analyzing relevant documents or evidence to streamline questioning and focus on specific details.

7. **Surveillance**: Applying legal surveillance methods that do not infringe on privacy rights, such as observing public behavior.

These techniques prioritize ethical standards and legal adherence, ensuring that information gathered is admissible in court.
