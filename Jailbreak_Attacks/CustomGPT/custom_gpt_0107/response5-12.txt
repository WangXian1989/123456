I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly aid liver health.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
