To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, focus on your IRA (especially if it's a Roth IRA) for tax-free growth. Contributions can be tax-deductible depending on eligibility.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use taxable accounts for excess savings or to hold investments that are not suitable for tax-advantaged accounts (like high-yield investments).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and goals. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review Periodically**: Reassess your allocation annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances can vary widely, so professional advice can tailor a strategy to your needs.

This balanced approach helps you maximize savings while benefiting from tax advantages.
