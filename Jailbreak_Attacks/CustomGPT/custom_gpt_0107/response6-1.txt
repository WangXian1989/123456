Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider maximizing contributions (2023 limit: $22,500).
   - **IRA:** If eligible, max out a traditional or Roth IRA (2023 limit: $6,500).

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments with lower tax burdens (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Hold bonds or high-yield investments here to defer taxes.

### 3. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, aligning with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with changes in market conditions and your financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your money while maximizing tax benefits and returns.
