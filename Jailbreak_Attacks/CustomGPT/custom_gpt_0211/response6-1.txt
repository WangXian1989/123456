The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. Maximize Employer Match
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you qualify, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.

### 3. Use Taxable Accounts Wisely
- **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing contributions to retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

### 4. Consider Your Tax Bracket
- **Tax Implications**: Strategically place higher-yield investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

### 5. Review and Adjust Regularly
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation based on changing goals and market conditions.

Staying informed on the specific rules and limits for each account type will also help optimize your investment strategy.
