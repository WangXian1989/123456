To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to obtain any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the match and funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments. They offer flexibility and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

5. **Investment Choices**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix.

7. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as income. Taxable accounts can provide more favorable treatment on long-term gains.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific situation.
