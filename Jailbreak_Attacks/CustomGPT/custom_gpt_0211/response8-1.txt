Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). 
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions can reduce taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income later.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for more liquid investments, but dividends and capital gains could incur taxes.

3. **Investment Horizon:**
   - Longer-term funds (like retirement savings) may benefit from being in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow without immediate tax impacts.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like index funds) and keep higher-yield investments for tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have liquid savings available before maximizing contributions to these accounts.
