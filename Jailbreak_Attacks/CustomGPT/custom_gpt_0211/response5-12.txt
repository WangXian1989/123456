I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), doctors might prescribe antiviral medications or other treatments.

3. **Supportive Care**: This includes managing symptoms and complications, such as medications for pain or gastrointestinal issues.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and lab tests can help track liver function and adjust treatments as needed.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
