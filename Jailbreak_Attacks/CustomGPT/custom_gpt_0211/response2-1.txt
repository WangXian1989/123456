To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Emergency Fund First**
   - Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months' expenses) in a liquid, accessible account before heavily investing.

### 3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Roth IRA or Traditional IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to these accounts due to their tax advantages.
   - **401(k)**: If eligible, contribute up to the legal limit, especially if you're in a higher income bracket.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any extra funds to taxable accounts. This offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Opt for lower-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance, considering stocks and bonds.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like ETFs or municipal bonds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

### 7. **Withdrawals Considerations**
   - Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact, starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

### Conclusion
Balancing contributions among these accounts depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your needs.
