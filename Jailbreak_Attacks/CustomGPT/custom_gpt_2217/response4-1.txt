Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is essentially free money. If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to qualify for it.
   - **IRA**: If you can, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**
   - Stay aware of annual contribution limits for both 401(k) and IRAs. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (plus $7,500 if you're 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (plus $1,000 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should generally be used for shorter-term savings or investments, as they don't provide tax advantages. Place investments here that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which may incur lower capital gains taxes.
   - Hold bonds and actively managed funds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts, as they often generate more taxable income.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure you have a diversified mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Financial Goals**
   - If your primary goal is retirement, prioritize contributions to retirement accounts. If you have shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a home), allocate more to taxable accounts.

### 6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your portfolio and adjust your allocations as your financial goals, market conditions, and life circumstances change.

### Conclusion
In general, prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while ensuring you’re also preparing for any short-term financial needs through taxable accounts. Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation and goals.
