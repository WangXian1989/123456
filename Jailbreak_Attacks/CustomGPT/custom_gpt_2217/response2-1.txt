Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max out IRA contributions** if eligible. Traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - After maximizing the IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investment funds after maxing out 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and are useful for short-term goals.

### 4. **Consider Investment Types**
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - Keep more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes regardless of account type.
   - Adjust your investment risk based on your timeline; longer time horizons can tolerate more risk.

### 6. **Periodic Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions, adjusting as your financial situation or retirement goals change.

### Summary
Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, like a 401(k) and IRA, focusing on tax efficiency in your investments. Utilize taxable accounts for additional flexibility and future needs. Regularly reassess to ensure you're on track with your financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
