To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to this if you haven't reached the match limit. It offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maxing out the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, utilize taxable accounts for additional investments. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts to lower your taxable income now. In lower brackets, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Different accounts have different tax implications, so distribute your investments accordingly.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account separate from your investment accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations and adjust contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
