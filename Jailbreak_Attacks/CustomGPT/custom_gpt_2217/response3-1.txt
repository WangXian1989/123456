Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a suggested approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Back to Your 401(k)**:
   - Once you've maxed out your IRA contributions, return to your 401(k), aiming to maximize your contributions (up to the annual limit).

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional savings in a taxable account. Here, focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Tax Impact**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of each account. Long-term capital gains rates in taxable accounts are generally lower than ordinary income tax rates applied to 401(k) and IRA withdrawals.

6. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy that supports your long-term financial goals.
