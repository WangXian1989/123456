Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to maximize that benefit, as it's essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Allocate for Growth and Access**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that you may want to access before retirement. This could include stocks or ETFs that have favorable long-term capital gains treatment.
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth investments since withdrawals will be taxed (for Traditional) or tax-free (for Roth) in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place bonds and high-yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield their income from taxes.
   - **Low-Turnover Funds**: Use tax-efficient strategies and investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - It's often beneficial to consult with a professional who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
