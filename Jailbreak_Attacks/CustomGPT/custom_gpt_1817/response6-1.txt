To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits either at the time of contribution (401(k), traditional IRA) or withdrawal (Roth IRA).
   - **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may require liquidity or for assets you're less likely to hold long-term, such as bonds or high-turnover stocks.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Diversify Investments**: Allocate different types of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) across these accounts to meet your risk tolerance and investment goals. For example, consider holding more aggressive investments in your taxable accounts where you might incur capital gains taxes.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your allocations and adjust them to maintain your desired asset mix, especially as your taxable accounts may not have the same tax considerations as your retirement accounts.

### 3. **Contribution Limits and Employer Matches**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full benefit before directing funds elsewhere.
   - **Utilize IRA Contributions**: Ensure to take advantage of IRA contributions if you're eligible, balancing traditional and Roth options based on your expected tax situation during retirement.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Plan for Retirement Withdrawals**: Strategically plan how youâ€™ll draw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes and prolong your portfolio's longevity. Generally, taxable accounts can be used for living expenses first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

### Conclusion
- **Evaluate Your Goals**: Each individual's situation is unique; therefore, continuously assess your financial goals and adjust your strategy accordingly.
- **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances. 

By considering these strategies, you can create an effective distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and tax situation.
