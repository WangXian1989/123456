Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plan with tax-deferred growth, often includes employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax benefits; contribution limits differ between Traditional and Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Non-retirement accounts with no tax advantages but flexible withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
   - **Fund IRAs**: If you can, contribute to an IRA after maximizing the 401(k) match. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings, especially once retirement accounts are maxed out.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Keep investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts. High-growth investments (like stocks) are better suited for taxable accounts to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk.

### 5. **Long-Term Focus**
   - Plan for the long-term; avoid withdrawing from tax-advantaged accounts unless necessary.
   - Rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personal advice tailored to your specific situation can be invaluable, especially regarding tax implications and investment strategies.

### Example Distribution Plan
1. **401(k)**: Contribute at least enough to get the employer match.
2. **IRA**: Aim to maximize contributions, prioritizing Roth if eligible for tax-free growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings or when nearing short-term financial goals. 

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments across your financial accounts.
