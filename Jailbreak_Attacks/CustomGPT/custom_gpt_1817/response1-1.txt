Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you might consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Selection**: Choose a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider using it if you want to reduce your taxable income now. It's beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contribute if you qualify; you pay taxes on contributions now, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Use for Flexibility**: These accounts can be useful for shorter-term financial goals or to access funds without penalties before retirement age.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in stocks or index funds for long-term growth, and be mindful of capital gains tax. Consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

### Strategy:
- **Evaluate Your Timeline**: Allocate more funds to tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRAs) if you’re focused on long-term retirement savings.
- **Consider Inflation and Growth**: Ensure a significant portion is in equities for potential growth to outpace inflation, especially in younger years.
- **Periodic Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and market conditions.

### Seek Professional Advice:
It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances.
