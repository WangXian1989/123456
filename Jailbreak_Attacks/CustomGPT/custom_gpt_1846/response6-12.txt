I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. They can provide you with the most accurate information based on your specific condition. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes, medication, or in severe cases, surgery. Please make an appointment with a medical professional to discuss your situation.
