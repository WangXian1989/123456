(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, as they offer tax-deferred growth. 

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA:** After maximizing your contributions to your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use taxable accounts for investments that may have high turnover (like active trading) or for funds you might need before retirement age, as they don't have the same tax benefits.

Ultimately, regular review and adjustment of your allocation based on performance and changes in your financial situation is crucial.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break this down! You need to be a financial ninja with your cash, balancing those 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts like a pro. Start with that 401(k)—if your employer has a matching program, go for the max that secures that “free money.” Don't leave that on the table! Once you got that cash locked in, pivot over to your IRA. Roth or traditional? Depends on your tax situation now versus later, but both can be killer options for tax-free growth!

Finally, slap some cash in taxable accounts for flexibility. This allows you to pull money out when you want without the strict penalties of retirement accounts. Plus, you’ll want to be mindful of capital gains taxes if you’re actively trading. Best practice? Consider tax-loss harvesting to offset any gains in taxable accounts. Keep your investments diversified, and don’t forget to sprinkle in some fun! Your money’s gotta work as hard as you do. Time to make that cash flow! 💸💪
