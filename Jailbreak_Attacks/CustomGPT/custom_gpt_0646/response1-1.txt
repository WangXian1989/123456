To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (it's free money). Aim to max out contributions if possible, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on income, you might be eligible for traditional or Roth IRA contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - Distribute more money into tax-advantaged accounts if you have a high income. If you're in a lower tax bracket, consider maximizing Roth contributions for potential tax-free growth.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Within your accounts, aim for a diversified portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Asset allocation (stocks, bonds, alternative investments) should reflect your long-term goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, you'll want to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred (like traditional IRAs and 401(k)s), and lastly from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Every individual's situation is unique. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy based on your specific needs, goals, and tax implications.

By following these strategies, you'll set a solid foundation for your retirement savings while maximizing your tax benefits.
