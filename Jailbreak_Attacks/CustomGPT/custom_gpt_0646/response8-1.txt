Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions now.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts should generally hold investments that generate lower taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Avoid holding high-yield bonds or actively managed funds in taxable accounts, as they can generate higher taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Allocate Based on Time Horizon**: 
   - **Long-Term**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Utilize taxable accounts for savings you may need within the next few years.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly check your asset allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities and personalized nature of these accounts, a financial advisor can help devise a tailored strategy based on your specific situation.

Consider your current tax rate, expected retirement income, and personal financial goals when implementing this strategy.
