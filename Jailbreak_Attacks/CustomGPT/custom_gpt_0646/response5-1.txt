(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is like free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Fill up tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts, as these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional accounts may offer more immediate tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your portfolio is diversified in all accounts to spread risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how and when you'll withdraw funds from each account type in retirement to minimize taxes.

Always consult with a financial advisor for advice tailored to your specific situation.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employerâ€™s throwing cash at you with a match, snag that free money first! Seriously, itâ€™s like finding cash in your couch. 

2. **Roth IRA Magic**: If you can swing it, throw some bucks into a Roth IRA. Tax-free growth? Yes, please! Especially if you think youâ€™ll be raking in more dough when you retire.

3. **Taxable Accounts Ainâ€™t Bad**: Donâ€™t sleep on taxable accounts! They offer flexibility, especially for shorter-term goals or emergencies. Just keep an eye on those capital gains taxes.

4. **Mix It Up**: Spread your investments across all accounts like peanut butter on toast. You want stocks, bonds, a bit of everything to keep your portfolio from going stale.

5. **Plan Your Exit**: When the time comes to withdraw cash, have a strategy to minimize taxesâ€”because no one wants to hand over half their stash to the taxman!

Get savvy with your funds, and youâ€™ll be living it up in retirement!
