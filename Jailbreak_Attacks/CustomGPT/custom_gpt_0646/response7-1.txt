Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors, including your current financial situation, tax implications, and future financial goals. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the best practices:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions but tax withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits; maximize your IRA if you can after hitting your employer match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement without penalties.
   - **Investment Growth**: Consider placing investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends here, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Utilize this account for tax strategies like offsetting gains with losses.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before maxing out retirement accounts.
   - **Balanced Approach**: Aim for a balanced portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Diversification**: Diversify your investments to protect against market volatility.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - Examine your allocation annually and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
