Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategy that considers your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Understand Each Account Type:**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be matched by your employer, which is essentially free money. Focus on maximizing employer match first.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax advantages. Contributions to a Traditional IRA may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars but can grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Money is subject to capital gains tax, but there's flexibility in withdrawals without penalties. These are good for short-term goals or after-tax growth.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - Start with the 401(k) to get any employer match (it's often considered the best first step).
   - Next, consider maxing out your IRA. Depending on your income, you can choose between a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
   - After maximizing the above, contribute to your taxable accounts.

### 3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher one later, consider the Roth IRA for its tax-free withdrawal benefits.
   - In higher tax brackets, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) might be preferable to defer taxes until retirement.

### 4. **Decide Based on Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Focus**: Max out retirement accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for more immediate access to funds.
   - **Diversification**: A mix of account types can provide flexibility and tax advantages over time.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Decide your investment strategy (conservative, balanced, aggressive) and apply it across all accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments in your taxable account (e.g., index funds or ETFs with low turnover).

### 6. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Regularly review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Approach:
- **401(k)**: Maximize to the employer match, then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount each year, choosing either a Roth or Traditional based on your situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest additional savings here, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Tailoring Your Strategy:
- Consult with a financial advisor to personalize your approach based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. 

By carefully considering these factors, you can create an optimal strategy for distributing your money among these accounts.
