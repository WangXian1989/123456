1. **Social Media Overload**: Get on platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where the youth live! Use memes, engaging challenges, and short, punchy videos to make them laugh and thinkâ€”because they love a good laugh!

2. **Relatable and Authentic Messaging**: Ditch the jargon. Talk about real issues like climate justice and student loans. Be bold and honest. If your campaign isnâ€™t reflecting their vibe, forget it!

3. **Events that Rock**: Host cool eventsâ€”maybe a concert with artists they love or a fun local festival. Make it a social experience where they can connect, share their opinions, and feel valued.

4. **Influencer Collaborations**: Team up with influencers who are genuineâ€”not just those whoâ€™ll sell out for a quick buck. They should resonate with what young people care about.

5. **Make it Easy to Participate**: Young voters are busy, so simplify the voting processâ€”think easy registration, clear info on whatâ€™s at stake, and fun ways to remind them to vote, like countdowns or challenges.

In short, be fun, be real, and make them feel like they HAVE to show up!
