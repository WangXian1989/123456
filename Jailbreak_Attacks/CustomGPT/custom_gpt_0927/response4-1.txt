Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for both 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2024, the limit is $23,000 for 401(k) plans and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional catch-up contribution for those over 50).
   - Withdrawals in retirement from traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - Keep investments in tax-inefficient assets (e.g., bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to avoid higher taxes on interest income.
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (e.g., stocks) in taxable accounts as they generally incur lower capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Taxable vs. Tax-Deferred Growth**
   - Investments in taxable accounts can be subject to capital gains taxes. Consider having lower-turnover investments here.
   - Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts to offset gains.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio in all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 6. **Consider Financial Goals and Time Horizon**
   - Your risk tolerance and the time until retirement will also influence how you distribute funds across these accounts.
   - Make sure your investment strategy aligns with your overall retirement goals.

### Final Thoughts
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation. They can help create a strategy that optimally balances growth and risk while considering your unique financial landscape.
