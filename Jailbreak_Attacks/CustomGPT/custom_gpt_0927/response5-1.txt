(ðŸ”’Normal Output) When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider a balanced approach based on your financial goals, retirement timeline, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: IRAs (both Traditional and Roth) offer tax advantages. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income, you may benefit from one over the other.

3. **Diversify Contributions**: After getting the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth. If youâ€™re over the contribution limit or already reaching retirement, focus on maxing out your 401(k).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed the tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This can offer flexibility and additional investment opportunities but be aware of capital gains taxes.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Itâ€™s important to review your investments regularly and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of funds! First off, you want to treat your money like a superhero teamâ€”each account has its own strengths.

1. **401(k) First**: Don't leave free money on the table! Max out the employer matchâ€”think of it like collecting a bonus you didnâ€™t even have to fight for.

2. **IRA Next**: Depending on where you're at with taxes, slide into a Roth IRA if you can. Contributions grow tax-free, and you can pull it out tax-free in retirement. Itâ€™s like the VIP lounge of investments!

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once youâ€™ve socked away in the other accounts, the taxable account becomes your wild card. You can play around without the crazy rules of retirement accounts. Just watch out for those tax implications!

4. **Reassess Yearly**: Keep checking on your strategy. Life changes, and so should your financial game plan!

Go hard or go home with your investing! Remember, balance is key, like a good dietâ€”but with a lot of money sprinkled in!
