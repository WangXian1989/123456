Distributing your money among different accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your distribution:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Prioritize long-term accounts like 401(k) and IRA for retirement.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for funds you'll need in the near future.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax strategy.

### 3. **Allocate According to Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Place higher-growth investments here, as they can grow without annual taxation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with lower expected returns (e.g., bonds) or tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution strategy to your financial situation and goals can significantly enhance your investment results over time. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
