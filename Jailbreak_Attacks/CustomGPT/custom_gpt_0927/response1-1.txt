Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (with a $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 ($1,000 catch-up for those 50+).

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance. Use tax-efficient investments (like broad index funds) in taxable accounts and consider holding bonds or high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on gains.

4. **Future Tax Implications**:
   - Consider your potential tax bracket in retirement. Balancing contributions to traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free) accounts can help manage your taxable income in the future.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy; typically, taxable accounts are drawn from first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer. 

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Review your allocations regularly as your financial situation and market conditions change.

**Example Allocation**:
- If you have the ability to max out your 401(k) and IRA, you might consider contributing enough to your 401(k) for the match, then fully fund the IRA, and finally contribute more to the 401(k) up to the limit.

Adjust these strategies based on your individual financial goals and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
