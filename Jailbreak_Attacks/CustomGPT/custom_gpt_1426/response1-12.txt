1. **Lifestyle Changes:** Reducing alcohol consumption, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the liver condition, certain medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
4. **Surgery:** In severe cases, procedures like liver transplants may be necessary.

Always seek professional medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your situation.
