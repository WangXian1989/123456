(Î±) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider the contribution limits for your IRA and aim to maximize that as well, especially since traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal. 
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, so if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritizing Roth contributions might be wise.
   - Taxable accounts can be useful for liquidity and investments that can benefit from favorable tax treatments on capital gains.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio within each account type. Different accounts can hold different assets suited to your tax situation.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance:**
   - As you get closer to retirement, you might want to shift from aggressive investments to more conservative options, balancing growth with the need for stability.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor the distribution to your specific circumstances.
