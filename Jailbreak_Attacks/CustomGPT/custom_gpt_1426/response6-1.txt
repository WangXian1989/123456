To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Your Tax Situations:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax advantages but can be limited by income restrictions. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals, but contributions are made with after-tax dollars.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes, so consider your investment strategy carefully.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; it's free money.
   - **After Maxing Out the Match**: Invest in IRAs, particularly if you can benefit from tax-free growth in a Roth IRA.
   - **Use Taxable Accounts for Additional Investments**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantage accounts, consider a taxable account to access funds without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts with a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risks.
   - Adjust allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

4. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.
   - Place less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

By prioritizing contributions effectively and managing your investments strategically, you can optimize growth potential while managing tax liabilities. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your individual circumstances.
