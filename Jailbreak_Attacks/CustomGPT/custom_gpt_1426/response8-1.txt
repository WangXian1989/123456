When it comes to distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, try to at least contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the match first, then consider maxing out your IRA if you're eligible.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions might be tax-deductible depending on your income and whether you or your spouse have a retirement plan at work.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   
3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 ($30,000 if age 50 or older)
   - Traditional and Roth IRA: $6,500 ($7,500 if age 50 or older)

4. **Assess Investment Options**: The investment choices may differ significantly between accounts:
   - Assess the fees and investment options available in your 401(k).
   - IRAs typically offer a broader range of investment choices.
   - Taxable accounts can hold any investments but may be subject to capital gains taxes when selling assets.

5. **Withdrawals and Emergency Funds**: Ensure you maintain liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties before age 59Â½.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Think about your tax situation, both now and in retirement. Generally, it's advisable to keep assets with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and fixed-income securities in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

7. **Diversification**: Ensure that you are diversifying your investments across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

8. **Revisit Your Strategy**: Regularly review and adjust your allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consulting with a financial adviser can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances and long-term objectives.
