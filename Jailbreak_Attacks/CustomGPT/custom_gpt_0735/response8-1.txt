The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations to help you create an effective distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the annual contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible (Traditional) or made with after-tax dollars (Roth), with tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement for Roth IRAs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, so they are generally less efficient for long-term growth compared to tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Investment Goals**: Your risk tolerance and investment horizon should dictate how you allocate investments within each account. Consider a more aggressive approach in your tax-advantaged accounts if you're decades away from retirement, while maintaining a more conservative portfolio in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and within each account type to mitigate risk.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you near retirement, plan your withdrawal strategy to minimize tax implications. It may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts like 401(k)s, before tapping into tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved in tax laws and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-rounded distribution strategy that aligns with your financial goals and helps maximize your retirement savings.
