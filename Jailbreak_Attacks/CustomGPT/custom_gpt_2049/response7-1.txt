Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Benefits**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar benefits to a 401(k) regarding tax deductions for contributions. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement (including growth) are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes on realized profits and interest income. Consider using these for short-term goals.

### 3. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Allocate more towards tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs due to compounded growth and tax benefits.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Balance your risk across all accounts based on your comfort level and investment horizon.

### 5. **Age and Timeline**
   - If you’re younger, prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts. As you approach retirement, start to shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess and adjust your allocations based on performance, changes in income, and life events.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match then contribute up to the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Max out a traditional or Roth IRA if eligible.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any remaining funds for investments, especially if you’re saving for goals within the next 5 years.

### Conclusion
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific situation. They can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial plan.
