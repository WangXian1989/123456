Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and age. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Continue with 401(k)**: After maximizing your IRA, increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can choose lower-cost investment options.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. These are flexible and accessible but will incur capital gains taxes on profits.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Tax Bracket**: Higher income may necessitate more tax-advantaged investments (401(k) and IRA).
- **Withdrawal Timeline**: Think about when you’ll need the money; taxable accounts are more accessible.
- **Investment Options**: Weigh the investment options and fees in each account type.

### General Allocation Example:
- **401(k)**: 20-25% (max employer match, then higher contributions)
- **IRA**: 10-15% (maximize if eligible)
- **Taxable Account**: Remaining 60-70%
