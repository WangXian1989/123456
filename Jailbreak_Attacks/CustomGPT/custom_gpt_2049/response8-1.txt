Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations based on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Continue Funding Your 401(k)**:
   - After contributing to an IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Allocate Funds to Taxable Accounts**:
   - If you have additional funds, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity, as funds can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to minimize taxes on dividends and interest. Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a liquid account before heavily investing.

7. **Assess Risk Tolerance and Goals**:
   - Adjust your investment mix based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals.

8. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation strategy periodically to adapt to changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
