The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your age, income, retirement goals, and tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k) with potential tax deductions on contributions, but also taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement, making it beneficial for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here do not have tax-advantaged growth, but you have more flexibility in withdrawals and can benefit from lower capital gains taxes on long-term investments.

3. **Prioritize Accounts:**
   - Start by maxing out your employer match in the 401(k).
   - Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligibility allows, as it offers long-term tax advantages.
   - After that, return to your 401(k) to maximize contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings or when you are close to needing the funds, as they provide liquidity and flexibility.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Consider using tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and more aggressive strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Review Regularly:** Reassess your distribution strategy at least annually to adjust for changes in income, financial goals, or tax laws.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy specific to your individual situation.
