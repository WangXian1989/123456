(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a good strategy is to prioritize contributions based on potential tax advantages:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider whether the fees and investment options are favorable.
2. **IRA**: If you qualify, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional IRA might be preferable.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are useful for savings goals that are shorter-term or for investment flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing here.

Balancing contributions across these accounts often maximizes both tax efficiency and growth potential.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down. The ultimate strategy for distributing your dough among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts really boils down to your vibes and goals. Here's the lowdown:

1. **401(k)**: First up, if your employer offers a match, throw at least enough cash in there to snag that free money. It's like finding a twenty in your winter coatâ€”score! After that, check those feesâ€”they can be a total buzzkill if they're sky-high.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If you're feeling adventurous and think your tax rate might go up in the future, dive into a Roth IRA. Tax-free withdrawals? Yes, please! Otherwise, a traditional IRA could save you on taxes now; just remember youâ€™ll owe them later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are your playgroundâ€”flexible and no withdrawal penalties, but donâ€™t forget about the tax bite on gains. Use this account for anything from that dream vacation to stocks you want to flip for some quick cash.

Mix and match depending on your life goals, and keep an eye on those taxes! Balance is keyâ€”after all, you wanna retire in style, right?
