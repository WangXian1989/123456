Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs can lower your taxable income, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once retirement accounts are maximized, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but come with capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Keep in mind that the type of investments you choose should align with your risk tolerance. Stocks can offer higher growth potential but are riskier, whereas bonds are generally safer but offer lower returns.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments with higher tax burdens (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) and consider holding investments with lower tax burdens (like stocks) in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust contributions as needed based on changes in income, career, or market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this approach to your unique situation!
