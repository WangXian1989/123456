Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to receive the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. The tax treatment of these accounts can provide significant benefits, especially in retirement.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Tax-Free Growth**: Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, making them appealing if you anticipate higher taxes in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds), as you won’t benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, stocks are favorable for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments may suit taxable accounts.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan how you’ll withdraw these funds in retirement. Having a strategy for which accounts to draw from first can minimize taxes over the long term.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailoring a strategy to your specific circumstances can significantly affect your financial health, so consider professional advice.

Always assess your situation annually as your financial goals and market conditions change.
