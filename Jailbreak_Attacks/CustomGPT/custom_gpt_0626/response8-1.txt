The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if you receive a match.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation). Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are flexible but donâ€™t offer the same tax advantages as IRAs or 401(k)s. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment strategy is diversified across various asset classes to balance risk and growth potential.

5. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly reassess your asset allocation and account distributions.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your overall financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.

By following these strategies, you can effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to meet your long-term financial goals.
