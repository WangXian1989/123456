Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: If you have high-interest debts, consider paying those off first before maximizing retirement accounts.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If possible, contribute the maximum allowed, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs give potential tax deductions.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged options, invest in taxable accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and time horizon. For instance, younger investors might focus more on equities, while those closer to retirement might lean toward bonds.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocation to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Remember, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique situation.
