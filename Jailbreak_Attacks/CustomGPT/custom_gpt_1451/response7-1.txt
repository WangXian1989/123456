Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

### 2. **Consider Your Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k)**: Typically holds a diversified mix of mutual funds. Consider allocating more aggressive investments here if you have a long time horizon.
   - **IRA**: You have more flexibility with investment options. Diversification is key; consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes. Use this account for shorter-term goals.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: Good for those in a higher tax bracket now who expect to be in a lower bracket during retirement.
   - **After-Tax Accounts (Roth IRA, Taxable)**: Good for those expecting higher future income or those wanting tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your portfolio as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account how each account type is performing.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can help you account for your unique financial situation and goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments and work towards your financial goals effectively.
