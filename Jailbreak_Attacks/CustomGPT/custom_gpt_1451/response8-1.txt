Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, such as your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here's a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **IRA**: These accounts can provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (in the case of Roth accounts), which is beneficial for long-term savings. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While they offer more flexibility (no contribution limits or penalties for early withdrawal), they may incur capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Prioritize Accounts**:
   - **Short-term Goals**: Funds needed in the next few years should be kept in taxable accounts or IRAs where you can easily access them.
   - **Long-term Goals**: For retirement savings, max out 401(k) contributions and then contribute to an IRA to take advantage of tax benefits.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account type based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to ensure they align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your individual circumstances.
