Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **Contribute Enough to Your 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) if you can. Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are more suitable for investments with higher turnover or those that might generate tax liabilities (e.g., bonds or certain stocks). It’s a more flexible option for withdrawals, but you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - **Asset Location:** Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-yield stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Allocate According to Risk Tolerance:** Ensure your distribution reflects your risk tolerance—higher-risk assets may go into tax-advantaged accounts to maximize their growth potential over time.
   - **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor your investments across all accounts and rebalance as needed to stay aligned with your investment goals.

### 4. **Future Withdrawals**
   - **Plan for Retirement Income:** Consider your withdrawal strategy for retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer, then use tax-deferred accounts based on your future income needs.

By assessing your current financial situation and goals, these strategies can help you optimize your investment distribution across these types of accounts. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
