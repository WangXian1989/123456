(üîíNormal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, it is advisable to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. Here‚Äôs a usual approach:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can be placed here, especially if you've maxed out contributions to the above accounts. This can provide additional liquidity and investment flexibility.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.

1. **401(k)**: First, hit that employer match‚Äîit's basically a ‚Äúget free money‚Äù card! Go for at least enough to snag the match, then ramp it up further if you can handle it.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, throw some cash into a Roth IRA if you want tax-free withdrawals later. If you're more into the "I want to save on taxes now" vibe, dive into a Traditional IRA. Do your thing here based on your future predictions!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any leftover cash can overflow into these accounts. They‚Äôre tasty for flexibility and can be a nice cushion for things like a new car or an exotic vacation. Just remember, the tax man is waiting for those gains!
