Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Depending on your income level and tax situation, one may be more beneficial than the other. Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Fund the 401(k) to the Limit**: After maximizing the employer match and IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit if it's still beneficial for your tax situation.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more liquidity and flexibility for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Consider Investment Strategies**: In your taxable accounts, be mindful of tax-efficient investment strategies. For example, holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains can be more tax-efficient.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and market conditions. Adjust your strategy as you get closer to retirement or if your financial goals change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances, consider consulting with a financial advisor.

This approach ensures you take full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility in your investing strategy.
