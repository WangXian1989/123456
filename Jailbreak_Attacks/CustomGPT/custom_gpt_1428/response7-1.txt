When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate a few factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount if your cash flow allows.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Funds in 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal. Conversely, Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars but grow tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts usually result in capital gains taxes on investments sold at a profit, so it might be beneficial to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in these accounts.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, but consider where to hold different types of investments. For example, it may be wise to keep tax-inefficient investments, such as bonds and REITs, in tax-deferred accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA).

4. **Regular Contributions and Rebalancing**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to all accounts based on your allocation strategy. Regularly review and rebalance your accounts to maintain desired asset allocation over time.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, you may want to take more risks, focusing on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts. If you're closer to retirement, consider shifting toward income-generating investments.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these suggestions to your specific situation and goals.
