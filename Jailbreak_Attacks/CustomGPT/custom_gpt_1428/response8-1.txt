Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals.

2. **Tax Diversification**:
   - Strive for a mix of tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), tax-free (Roth IRA), and taxable accounts to provide flexibility in retirement.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If youâ€™re saving for retirement, focus on long-term growth through equities in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - For shorter-term goals, consider maintaining more liquid and conservative investments in your taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - In retirement, consider the order of withdrawals (e.g., taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free) to minimize overall tax liability.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and to maintain a balanced portfolio across all account types.

6. **Stay Informed About Regulations**:
   - Be aware of contribution limits, penalties for early withdrawals, and the implications of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from retirement accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking personalized advice from a financial planner to tailor a distribution strategy to your unique financial situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a distribution strategy that maximizes your retirement savings while minimizing tax implications.
