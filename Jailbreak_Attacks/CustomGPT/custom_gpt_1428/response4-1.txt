When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to evaluate a few key factors: 

1. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer pre-tax contributions. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect your tax rate to increase.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed in the year it's received. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, making these accounts beneficial for holding investments you plan to hold long-term.

2. **Goals and Time Horizon**: 
   - Consider when you will need access to the funds. Funds in a 401(k) and IRA can incur penalties for early withdrawals (typically before age 59Â½), while taxable accounts allow you to access your money anytime without penalties.

3. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000 for individuals under age 50 and $30,500 for those 50 and older. For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 for individuals under age 50 and $7,500 for those 50 and older.

4. **Investment Options**: 
   - Your 401(k) might have limited investment options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts. Evaluate the available options to ensure they align with your investment strategy.

5. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your overall investment strategy is diversified across various asset classes. This can be spread across all types of accounts depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

A common strategy is to maximize employer contributions in your 401(k) (if applicable), contribute to an IRA (especially if considering a Roth IRA for future tax advantages), and then allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts. This allows for both tax-advantaged growth and flexibility of access to funds. 

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your individual circumstances and goals.
