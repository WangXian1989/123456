To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to a 401(k) reduce your taxable income, allowing for tax-deferred growth.

2. **Contributions for Tax Advantages**:
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, particularly if it is a Roth IRA, since qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for short-term savings or investments due to flexibility but be aware of capital gains taxes on profits.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments, as these accounts are typically long-term. Choose low-cost index funds or a diversified portfolio.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Opt for more conservative investments or tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Withdrawals**:
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax exposure, prioritizing taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

5. **Annual Review**:
   - Review and rebalance your asset allocation annually to align with your risk tolerance and retirement goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a well-structured investment strategy that maximizes growth while minimizing tax liabilities.
