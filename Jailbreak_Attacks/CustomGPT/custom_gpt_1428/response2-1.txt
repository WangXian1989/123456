Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth could be beneficial.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover mutual funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover 3-6 months’ worth of expenses before heavily investing.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your age and risk tolerance. Generally, the younger you are, the more aggressive you can be.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio periodically to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Future Tax Considerations**:
   - Think about your future income tax bracket. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to Roth accounts.

7. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement to optimize taxes – for instance, withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and lastly Roth accounts.

It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specifically to your situation.
