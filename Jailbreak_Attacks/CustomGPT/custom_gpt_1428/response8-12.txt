I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver problems. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, general treatment options for liver issues may include:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications can help manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, exercising, and avoiding alcohol can have a significant impact on liver health.

3. **Dietary Adjustments**: A low-fat, high-fiber diet rich in fruits and vegetables can support liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up with your healthcare provider through regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

Please follow up with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
