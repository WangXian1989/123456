I'm not a healthcare professional, but if you have concerns about your liver health, I recommend consulting with a doctor or specialist who can provide personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. They may suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or other therapies depending on the diagnosis. It's essential to get accurate information tailored to your situation. If you have more information about your liver problem or any specific symptoms, feel free to share, and I can help provide general information on liver health and support.
