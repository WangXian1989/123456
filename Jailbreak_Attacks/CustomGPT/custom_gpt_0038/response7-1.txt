When determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies based on your financial goals, age, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some important points to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to get the maximum employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) plan. For 2021, the limit is $19,500 (or $26,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax (or post-tax for a Roth 401(k)), which can reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Tax Diversification**: If eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a traditional IRA and/or a Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions, whereas Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2021, the contribution limit is $6,000 (or $7,000 if you’re age 50 or older).
   - **Flexibility**: IRAs typically offer a wider variety of investment options compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Liquidity**: Taxable accounts can provide easier access to funds without penalties for withdrawal, making them suitable for short-term savings or emergencies.
   - **Strategic Investments**: Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more stable, income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Overall Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance and how long you have until you need to access these funds. Younger investors might prefer more aggressive investments, while those nearing retirement might want to focus on preserving capital.
   - **Diversity**: Aim for a diverse portfolio across your accounts to balance risk and return effectively.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider getting personalized advice from a financial advisor who can help you create a strategy tailored to your specific financial circumstances and goals.

By strategically distributing your investments across these types of accounts, you'll be better positioned for long-term financial success while minimizing taxes owed over time.

Always keep in mind the changing regulations or tax laws that could affect your account management and allocations. It's wise to review and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve. 

Happy investing!
