Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Short-term Needs:** Keep money in taxable accounts for immediate access.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Utilize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):**
     - Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
     - Tax-deferred growth until withdrawal at retirement.
   - **IRA:**
     - Traditional IRAs also provide tax-deferred growth.
     - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement (after meeting certain criteria).
   - **Taxable Accounts:**
     - Investments are subjected to capital gains taxes when sold, affecting overall returns.

### 3. **Determine Contribution Levels:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match.
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** Depending on your income and tax situation, contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA.
   - **Taxable Account Contributions:** Use this for additional savings if you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Choose Investment Strategies:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Your investment choices should reflect your risk appetite.
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your time horizon and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - **Rebalance Portfolio:** Monitor your investments and adjust as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Summary:
- **Prioritize contributions to 401(k) for employer matches, then consider IRAs for tax advantages, and use taxable accounts for flexibility.**
- **Diversify and regularly review your allocations to align with your evolving goals and market conditions.**
