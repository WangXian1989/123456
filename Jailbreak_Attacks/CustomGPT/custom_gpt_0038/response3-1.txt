Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) matching contribution, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes on the money you put in until you withdraw it in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income. However, there are limits on contributions based on your income and whether you have access to a workplace retirement plan.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This accounts for the possibility of higher tax rates in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties before retirement age.

3. **Investment Timeline**:
   - If you have a long investment horizon, focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, mutual funds, etc.) in your retirement accounts, as they can benefit from compounding without immediate tax consequences.
   - For short-term goals (within 5 years), consider keeping funds in taxable accounts to access without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are well-diversified across asset classes to minimize risk. Consider various sectors, bonds, and international stocks.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As markets fluctuate, the proportion of money across these accounts may change. Regularly rebalance your portfolios to align with your financial goals.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily in these accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a savings account.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Personalized planning can make a significant difference, considering your unique circumstances and financial objectives.

**Conclusion**: A typical distribution strategy could be to fully contribute to your 401(k) up to the match, then contribute to an IRA (considering a Roth if you qualify), and finally, allocate any surplus funds to taxable accounts. Your exact allocation should depend on your financial situation and goals.
