To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Account Types**:  
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account, often with matching contributions. Potential tax benefits since contributions are made pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Contributions may be tax-deductible (traditional) or grow tax-free (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments subject to capital gains tax and dividends. More flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**:  
   If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first. Contributions can reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred or tax-free (for Roth accounts).
   - Utilize taxable accounts for investments that may generate lower capital gains or that you may need to access before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a mix of assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) in each account depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Different asset classes may have varied tax implications; for instance, bonds may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to higher tax rates on interest.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:  
   Plan how and when you will withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly from tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to minimize tax liabilities over time.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:  
   Ensure that your asset allocation aligns with your goals. Rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your personal or financial situation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:  
   If you're unsure about the best distribution strategy, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation and objectives.

In brief, a common approach is to max out your employerâ€™s 401(k) match, contribute to an IRA, and then use any additional funds for your taxable accounts. Adjust as per your personal financial situation and investment goals thereafter. 

Always remember to evaluate your overall financial plan and consider any changes in policies or tax laws. Happy investing!
