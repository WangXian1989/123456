Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to an IRA (traditional or Roth). Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Funds in 401(k) and traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, meaning you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, so withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider holding investments with lower turnover or tax-efficient funds there.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a good mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. 
   - Avoid duplicating assets in different accounts to maintain clarity in your investment strategy.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for immediate access in case you need liquidity, as withdrawals from retirement accounts can incur penalties if you're under age 59½.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given individual circumstances can vary widely, seeking personalized advice can be very beneficial.

Ultimately, a balanced approach tailored to your unique situation is key.
