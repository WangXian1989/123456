The ideal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If you're offered an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider allocating a larger portion here if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), ideal if your current tax rate is higher than what you expect in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is great if you anticipate your tax rate will be higher in the future.
   - **Diversification**: Aim for a balanced allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Investment Flexibility**: These accounts have no contribution limits, and you can access your money sooner without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains**: Be mindful of tax implications on realized gains. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Emergency Fund**: Maintain liquidity for unexpected expenses.

### General Allocation Strategy:
1. Max out contributions to 401(k) up to company match.
2. Contribute to a Roth IRA if eligible (income limits apply).
3. Use taxable accounts for additional investments or to maintain liquidity.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Regularly review your allocations based on changing income, life events, and market performance.

Ultimately, consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice specific to your situation.
