I'm not a medical professional, but common treatments for liver problems can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, weight loss, and alcohol cessation.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the issue, medications can help manage symptoms or treat specific conditions.
3. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation may be necessary.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Keeping up with lab tests and consultations with a healthcare provider.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice based on your situation.
