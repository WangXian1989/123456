Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Depending on your income, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are subject to capital gains tax. It's often best to hold investments with the least taxable events here, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on holding income-generating assets (like bonds) in your 401(k) and traditional IRA to defer taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) irrespective of the account type.

4. **Investment Time Horizon:**
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might have a higher percentage in equities, which can be more volatile.

5. **Annual Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal finance can be complicated. A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.

Ultimately, the best distribution will depend on your individual circumstances, including your age, income level, retirement goals, and risk tolerance.
