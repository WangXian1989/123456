To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then fund your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to the maximum allowed if your income qualifies.
   - **Evaluate Tax Bracket**: Determine your current and expected future tax bracket to choose between Roth (after-tax) and Traditional (pre-tax) accounts.

2. **Withdrawal Flexibility**:
   - **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for situations requiring liquidity or for short-term goals, since you can access them without penalties.

3. **Investment Growth**:
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments (equities) in tax-advantaged accounts where long-term capital gains can compound without immediate tax implications.
   - **Bonds and Income Investments in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds or income-generating investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalancing**:
   - **Diversify Across Accounts**: Ensure your overall asset allocation is consistent across all accounts, rebalancing as needed to maintain your risk tolerance.

5. **Future Contingencies**:
   - **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think about how and when youâ€™ll need to access these funds in retirement, and adjust your contribution strategy accordingly.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If unsure, seek personalized guidance to align your investment strategy with your retirement goals and risk tolerance.

Balancing contributions effectively across these accounts can enhance tax efficiency and help you achieve your financial goals.
