Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Matches**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income in the contribution year. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax money, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility but will incur capital gains taxes on investments sold for a profit.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts may be preferable.

### 4. **Diversification of Investment Types**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments that are expected to grow significantly (e.g., stocks).
   - Keep bonds or other income-generating assets in taxable accounts to minimize tax on qualified dividends and capital gains.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan for withdrawals based on tax implications. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income; Roth IRAs and taxable accounts have different tax implications.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Suggested Distribution Approach
- **401(k)**: Fund up to the employer match, then decide based on your tax situation.
- **IRA**: Maximize contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA depending on tax predictions.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings or short-term goals.

### Regular Review
- Reassess your strategy annually or after major life changes to ensure it aligns with your goals.

### Conclusion
Tailor this strategy to your unique circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
