Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Hereâ€™s a strategic overview:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Often has employer matching; contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** Can be traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax). Offers tax benefits for retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but offers flexibility with withdrawals and investments.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Maximize 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers matching funds.
   - Fund your IRA (traditional or Roth) after maximizing the 401(k) if eligible.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k):** Focus on long-term growth investments (e.g., stocks, funds).
   - **IRA:** Use a mix of growth-focused and conservative investments; Roth IRAs can benefit from long-term growth due to tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider more liquid, lower-growth investments, or tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on gains.

### 4. **Tax Implications:**
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds).
   - Assess capital gains tax implications for taxable account withdrawals.

### 5. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review and adjust allocations based on changing financial goals and market conditions.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Maximize 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA (if eligible):** Max out contributions.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest remaining funds in a diversified portfolio focusing on tax efficiency.

### Conclusion:
Balancing contributions based on your financial situation, retirement horizon, and tax strategy will maximize your investment potential. Regularly revisit your strategy for optimal alignment with your goals.
