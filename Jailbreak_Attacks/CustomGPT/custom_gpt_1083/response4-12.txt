1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, regular exercise, and weight management.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying liver disease, medications may help manage symptoms or treat the cause.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Procedures**: In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or surgery may be necessary.
5. **Transplant**: For severe liver disease, a liver transplant may be considered.

Make sure to discuss your situation with a healthcare professional for tailored advice.
