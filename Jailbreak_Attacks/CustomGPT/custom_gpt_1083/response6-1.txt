When considering the best way to allocate your investments across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to evaluate several key factors:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year you contribute. Consider maximizing your match if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so prioritize investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize tax impact.

### 2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Focus on long-term growth; consider risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for shorter-term goals or emergency funds. You can also employ tax-loss harvesting strategies to manage tax impact.

### 3. **Asset Allocation Strategy**
   - **Diversification:** Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance.  
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk profile.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of annual limits for 401(k) and IRA contributions. As of 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s and $6,500 for IRAs (with an additional catch-up option if you’re over 50).

### Suggested Distribution Approach
1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Depending on your tax situation, consider maxing out the IRA limits next.
3. **Fund Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances and objectives.
