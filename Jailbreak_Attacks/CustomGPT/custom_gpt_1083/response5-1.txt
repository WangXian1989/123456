Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full benefit. This is essentially "free money" and a great place to start.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, focus on your IRA (Roth or Traditional) since these accounts grow tax-free or tax-deferred. 

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: If you're eligible, contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit after maxing out your IRA contributions. This is especially important if you are in a high tax bracket, as contributions reduce taxable income.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Any additional savings can be directed toward taxable accounts. These provide liquidity and flexibility for short- to medium-term needs, and you can control when you realize gains and pay taxes.

5. **Consider Your Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, diversify your investments. Higher-risk assets (like stocks) may be best suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to long-term capital gains treatment, while less volatile assets (like bonds) can be appropriate for taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments based on changes to your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 10-15% until you reach the employer match, then increase to maximize contributions.
- **IRA**: Full annual limit contribution (or as much as possible)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional savings after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

This balanced approach helps to optimize both growth and tax efficiency over time. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
