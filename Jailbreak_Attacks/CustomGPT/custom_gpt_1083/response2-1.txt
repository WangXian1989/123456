Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some key points to consider for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free" money.
- **Contribution Limits**: Max out your contributions when possible. In 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50+).
- **Investment Options**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy. 

### 2. **IRA (Traditional & Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**:
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).
- **Diversification**: Use IRAs to invest in a wide variety of assets and strategies, including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: These accounts offer the most flexibility regarding withdrawals, but you'll be taxed on dividends and capital gains.
- **Consider Investment Type**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (like municipal bonds) or for specific goals with shorter time horizons.

### **General Distribution Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to maximize your 401(k) match and then consider IRA contributions (Roth for long-term tax-free growth, traditional for current tax benefits).
- **Balance Contributions**: After maxing out tax-advantaged options, direct any additional savings to taxable accounts.
- **Reassess Regularly**: Review and adjust your contributions annually based on changes in your income, tax situation, and retirement goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By thoughtfully allocating your contributions, you can optimize your tax situation while preparing for a secure retirement.
