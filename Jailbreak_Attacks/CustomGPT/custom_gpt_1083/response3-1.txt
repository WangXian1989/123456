Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored plans that often come with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-advantaged growth. Contributions can be pre-tax (traditional IRA) or after-tax (Roth IRA). Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments that do not have tax advantages. You'll pay capital gains tax on profits when selling investments.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on holding income-generating investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts to delay taxes.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that produce minimal annual income, like long-term equity investments, which benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match (if available), as this is essentially "free money".
   - Max out IRA contributions if you're eligible, especially if you can benefit from tax deductions.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Maintain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - Consider using a target-date fund in accounts where you may not want to manage investments actively.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus more on equities for growth within all accounts.
   - **Closer to Retirement**: Decrease exposure to stocks and increase bonds for stability.

### 6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Tax Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial planner or tax advisor to tailor a distribution strategy to your specific financial situation.

### General Suggested Distribution:
- **401(k)**: Maximize employer match and consider allocating 20-30% of your contributions here.
- **IRA**: Aim to fully utilize your contribution limits (up to $6,500 for individuals under 50; $7,500 for those 50 and older).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds, focusing on long-term investments with favorable capital gains treatment.

Ultimately, the best strategy depends on your unique financial situation and goals, so regular reviews and adjustments are key.
