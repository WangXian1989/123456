I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Dietary Improvements**: A balanced, low-fat diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can be beneficial.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing weight if overweight can help improve liver function.
   - **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is essential for liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral Drugs**: For hepatitis or viral infections, antiviral medications may be prescribed.
   - **Corticosteroids**: If there's inflammation, corticosteroids may help reduce it.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Routine blood tests and imaging may be necessary to monitor liver health and function.

4. **Medical Procedures**:
   - In severe cases, procedures to remove blockages or treat liver tumors may be necessary.
   - **Liver Transplant**: For end-stage liver disease, a transplant may be the only option.

5. **Supplements and Herbal Remedies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but always discuss these with a healthcare provider as they can interact with other medications.

6. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also improve liver health.

Please consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment tailored to your specific situation.
