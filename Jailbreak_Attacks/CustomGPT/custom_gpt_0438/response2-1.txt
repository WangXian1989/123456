Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here's a general framework to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable if your budget allows.
   - **Traditional IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income level and tax situation, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Considerations**:
   - Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are tax-deductible, lowering your taxable income for the year, while Roth accounts use post-tax dollars but provide tax-free withdrawals.
   - Depending on your current vs. expected future tax rates, you may prefer one type of account over another.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility for withdrawals and different types of investments not available in retirement accounts.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Younger investors often favor equities for growth, while those closer to retirement might prioritize bonds and lower-risk assets.
   - Different accounts could contain different types of assets based on their tax implications. For example, you might place higher yield assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your personal financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure about the best strategy for your specific situation, consider working with a financial planner who can tailor advice based on your overall financial picture.

Implementing these strategies can help you optimize your investment distribution, balancing growth, income, and tax efficiency.
