Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and current tax situation. Here are some considerations for each account type:

### 1. **401(k)**
- **Contributions**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Aim for at least the match amount to benefit from "free money."
- **Investment Options**: Consider a diversified mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance. Many 401(k)s have limited investment options, so choose wisely.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
- **Tax Considerations**: 
  - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed during retirement.
  - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA can be beneficial.
- **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if possible. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
- **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergencies, as they provide easy access to funds without penalties.
- **Investment Strategy**: Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower capital gains rates.

### General Strategy
- **Diversification**: Spread your investments across various asset classes.
- **Time Horizon**: Align your investment choices with your time horizonâ€”longer for retirement accounts and possibly shorter for taxable accounts.
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Review and adjust your distribution annually to maintain your intended asset allocation.

### Example Allocation
- **Younger Investors (20s-30s)**: 15-20% in 401(k), 10-15% in IRA, 10-15% in taxable.
- **Mid-Aged Investors (40s-50s)**: 20-30% in 401(k), 15-25% in IRA, 15-20% in taxable.
- **Near Retirement (60s)**: 30-40% in 401(k), 20-30% in IRA, 20-30% in taxable.

### Final Thoughts
Personal circumstances vary, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for a tailored plan.
