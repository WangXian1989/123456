When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best strategy often depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your workplace offers a 401(k) with an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It’s free money and a great way to start.

2. **Fund Your IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and qualifications. IRAs often provide more investment choices and tax advantages.

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, consider boosting your contributions to your 401(k), up to the annual limit. This helps grow your retirement savings tax-deferred.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts and have extra funds, you can invest in a taxable account. This can provide flexibility for short-term goals, but keep in mind the potential tax implications of capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and ensure you’re on track for your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Ultimately, each individual’s situation is unique, so adapt this approach based on your financial landscape and objectives.
