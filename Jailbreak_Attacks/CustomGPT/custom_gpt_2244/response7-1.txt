Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. Contribute to the 401(k) First
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Maximize your contributions up to the annual limit if possible.

### 2. Fund your IRA
   - **Tax Benefits**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, you can get tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of IRA contribution limits and deadlines.

### 3. Invest in Taxable Accounts
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds without penalties, but they don't have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.
   - **Investment Types**: Consider lower-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. Strategy Based on Your Goals
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Money you may need in the next few years should not be in retirement accounts due to early withdrawal penalties. Focus on taxable accounts.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Aim for significant contributions to tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.

### 5. Consider Tax Efficiency
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments with high expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and interest-bearing assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize for taxes.

### 6. Regularly Reassess
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and goals, especially as your financial situation changes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.
