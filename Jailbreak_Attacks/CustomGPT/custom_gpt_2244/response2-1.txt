Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Retirement Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are flexible but come with tax implications on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Consider keeping investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to benefit from lower tax rates.

3. **Consider Your Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited to a selection of mutual funds or ETFs, focus on diversified, low-cost options.
   - **IRA**: You may have a wider range of investment options, including individual stocks, bonds, and other securities. Take advantage of this flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with higher liquidity needs or for dollar-cost averaging strategies.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep your overall asset allocation in mind. If you're more aggressive in your taxable accounts, consider placing more stable investments in your retirement accounts.
   - Rebalance periodically to maintain your desired allocation across all types of accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you near retirement, develop a strategy for withdrawing funds from these accounts in a tax-efficient manner. Generally, it might be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRA).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities involved, it may be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and goals.

Keep in mind that financial decisions should align with your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Regular review and adjustment of your strategy are also important to respond to changes in your life circumstances and market conditions.
