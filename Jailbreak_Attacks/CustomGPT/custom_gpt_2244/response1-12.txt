I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that if you're dealing with liver problems, you should definitely consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific issue, but common approaches can include lifestyle changes like a healthier diet, avoiding alcohol, medication, or in severe cases, procedures like liver transplantation. Remember, itâ€™s crucial to get tailored advice from a qualified healthcare provider!
