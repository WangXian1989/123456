Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here’s a general approach to help guide your distribution strategy:

1. **Contribute to Employer-Sponsored Plans First**: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution, prioritize funding this account up to the match limit. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a traditional 401(k), consider contributing the maximum allowed. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Additionally, explore whether you have access to a Roth 401(k), where contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **IRA**: After optimizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. You can choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax rates. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maximizing the contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and do not have contribution limits, but they also don't offer the same tax benefits.

4. **Asset Allocation Considerations**: 
   - Keep in mind the types of investments you hold in each account. Generally, it’s advisable to place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize your overall tax burden.

5. **Review and Adjust Periodically**: Regularly review your investment distribution and asset allocation as your financial situation and market conditions change. Adjust your contributions accordingly to ensure that you're on track to meet your retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and individual financial situations, consulting a certified financial planner or advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your circumstances.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first and maintaining a balanced approach across your investment accounts, you can invest wisely for both short-term flexibility and long-term retirement savings.
