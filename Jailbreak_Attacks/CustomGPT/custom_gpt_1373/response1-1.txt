Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) with matching contributions, prioritize this account to maximize the match, as it's essentially "free money." Contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds elsewhere.

2. **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA:** Depending on your income and tax situation, consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions in the year you contribute, while Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If eligible, prioritize this account after maximizing your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into a taxable investment account. This is useful for more flexible access to your funds and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Emergency Fund:** Before aggressive investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, covering at least 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses.

5. **Investment Strategy:** Align your investment strategy with your risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Diversify your investments across different asset classes to manage risk.

6. **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation based on performance and life changes.

It's crucial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this distribution strategy to your unique situation and maximize your long-term financial health.
