I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can improve liver health. Avoid excess fats and sugars.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.
   - **Alcohol**: Limit or avoid alcohol intake, as it can worsen liver problems.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), there may be specific medications available. For instance, antiviral medications can help treat certain types of hepatitis.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function are essential.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cancer or cirrhosis leading to liver failure, a transplant may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements or alternative medicine, but always discuss these with your doctor to avoid interactions with prescribed treatments.

It's vital to work closely with healthcare providers to determine the best treatment plan for your specific condition.
