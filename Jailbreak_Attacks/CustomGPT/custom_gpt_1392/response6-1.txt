To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which lowers your taxable income for the year.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, prioritize this.

### 3. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - **Taxable Accounts**:
     - Use these for investments that generate lower taxable income (like municipal bonds) or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.
     - Consider keeping high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize compounding.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**
   - Younger investors might lean more heavily into growth-focused investments, while those nearing retirement should prioritize stability and income generation.

### 5. **Continually Reassess and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and re-balance as needed based on market performance and life changes.

By strategically managing contributions and considering tax implications, you can optimize your investment growth and retirement readiness.
