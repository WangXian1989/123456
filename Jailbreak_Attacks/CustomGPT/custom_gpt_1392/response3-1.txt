Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - **Retirement Savings:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Use taxable accounts for more liquid investments.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Max out contributions to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
   - **IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that don’t fit in tax-advantaged accounts or for any surplus funds.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions lower your taxable income now; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax treatment as a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after tax, so withdrawals during retirement are tax-free (if conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they’re realized.

### 4. **Investment Strategies:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth (stocks, mutual funds).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize impact from taxes.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and make adjustments based on market performance and your financial situation.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 50%
- **IRA:** 30%
- **Taxable Accounts:** 20%

### Conclusion:
Tailor this strategy to your specific situation, considering factors such as age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
