It’s important to consider various factors when determining how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some strategies to help guide your decision:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which means they lower your taxable income for the year. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and withdrawals are subject to tax.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. If eligible, consider maxing out your Roth IRA after contributing to tax-deferred accounts.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income (interest, dividends, and capital gains) is taxable in the year it is earned. This account is more flexible for withdrawals.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Understand the contribution limits for each account type:
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're age 50 or older).
   - Taxable accounts don’t have contribution limits, but consider your overall savings strategy.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Consider your long-term financial goals and how soon you will need to access the funds:
   - If you’re saving for retirement (30+ years away), prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.
   - If you expect to need the money sooner, consider keeping more in taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match before diverting additional funds elsewhere, as this is essentially free money.

5. **Risk Tolerance and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance. Each account may hold different types of investments based on how you plan to draw from them in retirement:
   - Growth-focused investments may be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.
   - Conservative investments that generate income could work well in taxable accounts to take advantage of capital gains treatment.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to work with a financial planner to tailor a distribution strategy that fits your financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

By considering these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to managing your savings across different account types effectively.
