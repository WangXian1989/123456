(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Generally, a strategic approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to the maximum limit if feasible.
   
2. **IRA**: Next, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth) depending on your income and tax situation. The IRA can offer tax benefits that can enhance your savings.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can allocate additional funds to a taxable investment account. This is useful for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties.

It's crucial to evaluate your overall investment strategy and consult with a financial advisor to tailor this allocation to your specific situation.

1. **Start with that 401(k)**. If you have an employer match, smash that limit! Itâ€™s like finding free cash under your couch cushions â€“ you canâ€™t ignore it! Go for the max if you can. 

2. **IRA or Bust**. Once youâ€™ve milked that 401(k), swing over to an IRA. If youâ€™re on the younger side and expect to be richer later, a Roth IRA is your buddy because you pay taxes now, and Uncle Sam canâ€™t touch your gains later!

3. **Taxable Accounts**? Now, that's where the real party starts â€“ but remember, youâ€™ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. Use this account for flexibility or if you want to invest outside the usual retirement stuff. 

Always crunch the numbers and consider your long-term goals. And hey, if this is too overwhelming, a financial advisor can totally help you dominate the distribution game like a champ!
