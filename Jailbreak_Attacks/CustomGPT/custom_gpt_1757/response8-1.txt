To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **Max Out IRA Contributions**: For 2023, the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re aged 50 or older). If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it for tax-free growth.
   - **Max Out 401(k) Contributions**: The contribution limit for 401(k)s is $22,500 ($30,000 if 50 or older). 

3. **Analyze Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax liabilities, like municipal bonds or investments that you plan to hold long-term to benefit from capital gains tax rates.
   - **Loss Harvesting**: In taxable accounts, look for opportunities to sell investments at a loss to offset capital gains taxes.

4. **Invest Based on Time Horizon**:
   - Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where growth is tax-deferred or tax-free, and more conservative investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Diversification & Asset Allocation**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio by allocating across various asset classes based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Rebalance periodically to keep your desired allocation.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Be mindful of fund expenses, especially in your 401(k). Low-cost index funds or ETFs are typically more desirable.

7. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid financial plan that includes an emergency fund outside these investment accounts to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

8. **Regular Contributions**: Make it a habit to contribute regularly, leveraging dollar-cost averaging to reduce the impact of market volatility.

It’s strongly advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. Would you like more detailed steps on any of these aspects?
