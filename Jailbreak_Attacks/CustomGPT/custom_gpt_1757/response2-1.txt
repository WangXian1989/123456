When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Contributions (401(k))**
   - **Contribution Limit**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive the full company match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Fund an IRA**
   - **Types of IRAs**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limit**: For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting additional funds into taxable accounts.
   - **Flexibility**: This offers more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and tax implications only on realized gains.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Consider a long-term strategy that matches your risk tolerance. Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: In taxable accounts, prioritize tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your investment allocation to ensure it aligns with your goals, especially as you approach retirement age.

### Example Strategy
1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the maximum employer match.
2. **IRA**: Fully fund a Roth or Traditional IRA.
3. **Taxable Account**: Allocate remaining funds as needed, focusing on low-turnover and tax-efficient investments.

### Conclusion
Striking the right balance depends on personal circumstances, including current income, expected retirement income, and tax situation. It may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific needs and goals.
