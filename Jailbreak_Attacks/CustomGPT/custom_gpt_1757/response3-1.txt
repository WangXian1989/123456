When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment options available in each account. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand Your Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Can be Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free growth). Limits apply to contributions based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments made with after-tax dollars. Capital gains and dividends are subject to taxes in the year they are realized.

2. **Evaluate Your Financial Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals, which will influence your investment strategy.
   - Consider factors like retirement age, income needs in retirement, and risk tolerance.

3. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a Traditional IRA if you want tax breaks now.

4. **Fund Your Taxable Account**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, consider investing in a taxable account for flexibility. This can be useful for emergencies or short-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-turnover investments (like active funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**:
   - Review your investment allocation and contributions annually or when significant life changes occur (such as a job change, marriage, or home purchase).

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're uncertain about how to balance your investments, consider consulting a financial advisor for a personalized strategy.

Remember, the right distribution will vary based on individual circumstances, so it's important to tailor these recommendations to your specific situation.
