Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should be based on several personal factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - After maximizing the employer match, consider funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals). IRAs often provide more flexibility in investment options compared to a 401(k).
   - If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Contribute to 401(k):** After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue adding to your 401(k) up to the contribution limit. This can help lower your taxable income and grow your savings tax-deferred.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Any funds you want to keep more accessible for short-term goals (like purchasing a home, travel, or emergency expenses) should go into taxable accounts. This gives you access to your money without penalty, although you'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

5. **Asset Allocation Strategy:** Use an appropriate asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and the type of account:
   - Consider holding higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Place lower-growth, more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, where the tax impact can be more significant.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustments:** Periodically review your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Adjust contributions as needed based on changing life circumstances and financial needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If youâ€™re unsure of the best distribution strategy for your particular situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy will depend on individual circumstances and financial goals.
