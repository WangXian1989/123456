Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Limits for 2023 are $22,500, or $30,000 if youâ€™re over 50.
   - **IRA:** If you qualify, consider funding a Traditional or Roth IRA. The 2023 contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're age 50 or older).

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Bracket:** If you are in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional 401(k) or IRA can provide immediate tax savings, while a Roth account can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts can provide flexibility and liquidity. However, realize they won't offer tax deferment advantages like retirement accounts.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, diversify your portfolio based on risk tolerance and investment horizon. Equities, bonds, and alternative assets should be considered.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize accounts with the most growth potential for long-term savings (like 401(k) and IRAs).
   - **Flexibility Needs:** Ensure you have sufficient funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies to avoid penalties on early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

### Example Strategy
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match.
2. Max out your IRA contributions if eligible.
3. After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest any additional money into a taxable brokerage account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

This balanced approach can help you maximize your investment potential while considering tax implications. Always consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
