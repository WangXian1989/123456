To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matching (often a 401(k) match). This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are especially beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out retirement accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for flexibility and accessibility. 

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Since these accounts have tax advantages, they are suitable for holding investments that may generate higher taxable income, such as bonds, REITs, or high-dividend stocks. Consider a mix of growth and income, and be mindful of the types of investments that may yield capital gains taxes later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds and tax-managed funds. Consider holding stocks that you are less likely to sell frequently to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Understand how withdrawals are taxed. Distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - Tax-loss harvesting can be utilized in taxable accounts to offset capital gains.

4. **Long-term vs. Short-term Goals**:
   - Use retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth and save taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or emergencies since they provide easier access to funds.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation and manage risk.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - If you're unsure about the right distribution based on your financial goals, consider consulting a financial advisor who can provide personalized insights.

By following these strategies and regularly reviewing your financial situation, you can optimize your investment distribution across all accounts.
