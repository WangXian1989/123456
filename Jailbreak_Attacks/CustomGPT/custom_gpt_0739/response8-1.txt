Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Consider maxing out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which type aligns better with your tax strategy and goals.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or dividends. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so holding investments for over a year can reduce your tax burden.
   - **Asset Location**: Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts and interest-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to optimize taxes.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Ensure that your investment portfolio is diversified across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. **Set Clear Financial Goals**:
   - Define short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for short-term goals, while 401(k)s and IRAs are better for long-term retirement savings.

5. **Revisit and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and reallocate as necessary to stay in line with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If you are close to retirement, prioritize more conservative investments to protect your capital.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out up to employer match, then consider contributing additional funds if you are under 50 (up to $22,500 for 2024; higher if over 50).
- **IRA**: Contribute up to $6,500 if under 50 (or $7,500 if over 50) to a traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use any additional funds for taxable investing, focusing on long-term growth investments.

### Conclusion:
Tailor these strategies to fit your personal financial situation, and consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
