Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Contribute to Employer 401(k) First:**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

### 2. **Maximize IRA Contributions:**
   - Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. IRAs often have more investment options compared to 401(k)s.

### 3. **Continue Funding the 401(k):**
   - After maximizing your IRA contributions, continue to invest in your 401(k) up to the annual limit. This can offer tax advantages.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement accounts. These can be more flexible for accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

### 5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and goals. Higher growth investments (like stocks) might be better for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments could work well in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

### 6. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Keep in mind taxes when buying, selling, or withdrawing from accounts. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Adjust your distribution strategy as your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement.

### Additional Tips:
- Consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific needs.
- Stay informed about contribution limits and changing tax laws.

By balancing your contributions thoughtfully across these accounts, you can optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
