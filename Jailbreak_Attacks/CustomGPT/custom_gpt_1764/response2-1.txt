Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is crucial for optimizing your retirement savings and minimizing tax liabilities. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to maximize this match. It's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider contributing a higher percentage if you're in a higher tax bracket, as it enhances your immediate tax benefits.
   - **Investment Options**: Review the investment options available in your 401(k) as these can vary. Choose a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and funds that align with your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax contributions) or a Roth IRA (post-tax contributions). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for IRAs which can vary (for example, in 2023, itâ€™s $6,500 with an extra $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older).
   - **Tax Diversification**: Consider maintaining a mix of both Traditional and Roth IRAs to diversify your tax exposure in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments without penalties, but they are subject to capital gains tax.
   - **Investment Strategy**: Invest in assets that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions. You may also want to consider municipal bonds, which are tax-free at the federal level.
   - **Long-Term Focus**: Aim to hold investments for the long term to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **First**: Max out your 401(k) contributions to get the employer match.
- **Second**: Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing either a Traditional or Roth, based on your tax strategy.
- **Third**: Any additional savings can go into a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

It's also wise to reassess your allocations periodically and adjust based on changes in income, tax situations, and retirement goals.
