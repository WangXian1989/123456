When it comes to distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment risk tolerance. Here's a general strategy to help you allocate your investments:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it's effectively free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: These accounts offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on earnings until withdrawal. Consider funding these first if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. It may be beneficial to contribute to this account once you've maximized employer matches in your 401(k). 

3. **Assess Your Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts can be useful for any short-term financial needs, as they allow for quicker access to funds without penalties. Allocate funds here based on your cash flow requirements.

4. **Diversification of Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) within each account type to mitigate risks.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Establish a consistent contribution plan to all accounts to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific circumstances. Understanding your unique goals and preferences can lead to a more effective investment strategy. Would you like to explore specific investment options or risk levels that interest you?
