Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful planning, considering factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timelines. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA (if you qualify) for its tax-free growth potential, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions depending on your income level and tax filing status.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Generally, high-growth investments (like stocks) should be held in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Conversely, consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts as they may be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing contributions to tax-deferred accounts may be beneficial.

4. **Maintain a Balanced Asset Allocation**:
   - Ensure that across all accounts, your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Rebalance periodically to maintain your investment strategy.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**:
   - Maintain sufficient liquidity in your taxable accounts to handle any short-term needs or emergencies without dipping into retirement savings, which may incur taxes and penalties.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your individual situation is always a wise decision to optimize your strategy.
