To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA for tax benefits.
   - **Understand Tax Brackets**: Allocate investments based on expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Use your 401(k) and IRA for high-growth, riskier investments due to tax-deferral benefits.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for easy access without penalties.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k)**: Maximize contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across different asset classes in all accounts.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust based on performance and shifting financial goals.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a taxable account before allocating all other funds.

### 6. **Employer Match**
   - Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer matching funds.

### Conclusion
Assess your individual financial situation and goals to determine the optimal allocation mix tailored to your needs. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies.
