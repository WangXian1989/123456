Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals and situation. Here are some strategies:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate returns through matching funds.

2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify. This allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, focus on a traditional IRA.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or investments that generate lower taxes, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 months of expenses in an accessible account.
- **Retirement Focus**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for maximum growth potential.
- **Diversify**: Spread investments across different asset classes to manage risk.

### Adjust Based on Goals:
- For **short-term needs**, lean towards taxable accounts.
- For **long-term growth**, maximize 401(k) and IRA contributions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor this to your specific situation!
