To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth) for tax benefits. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **401(k)**: Increase contributions once you've maximized the IRA, focusing on pre-tax contributions for immediate tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investment options that may not fit in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., short-term investments).
   - Prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and contributions annually or after significant life changes.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how withdrawals will impact your tax situation later in retirement to minimize taxes.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also tailor these strategies to your personal situation.
