To distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively, consider these key principles:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Assess Investment Goals**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might access in the near future.

3. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like bonds) that generate interest income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly assess your allocations and rebalance as needed based on performance and changing goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
