Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider contributing the maximum if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.
   
3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before heavily investing, ensure high-interest debts (like credit cards) are managed.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) set aside in a liquid, easily accessible account.

5. **Allocate Towards Taxable Accounts**: After maxing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This can be useful for long-term investments or if you need access to funds before retirement.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments across all accounts. For example:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on a diversified mix of stock and bond funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar diversification but consider higher-risk assets if the time horizon is long.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding assets that benefit from long-term capital gains rates or municipal bonds for tax efficiency.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your target asset allocation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation.

This approach balances tax efficiency and investment growth potential while considering liquidity needs.
