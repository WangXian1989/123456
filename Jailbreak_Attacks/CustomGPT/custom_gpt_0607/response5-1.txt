Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Consider maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 in a 401(k) and $6,500 to an IRA. 

3. **Asset Allocation**: For tax-managed growth, place investments likely to appreciate in value (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Bond investments, which often generate interest income that is taxed at ordinary income rates, can be placed in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation, and rebalance annually to maintain your intended investment strategy.

5. **Withdrawals Consideration**: Be mindful of when you plan to withdraw from these accounts. IRAs and 401(k)s have penalties for early withdrawal, while taxable accounts generally do not.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: If you're saving for retirement, generally prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first, followed by taxable accounts for short-term needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Individual situations vary widely, so consider getting personalized advice from a financial planner.

Balancing contributions among these accounts strategically can help optimize your tax situation and investment growth over time.
