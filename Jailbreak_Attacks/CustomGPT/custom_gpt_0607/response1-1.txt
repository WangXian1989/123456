Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guide:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If you're under 50, the max contribution is typically $19,500, or $26,000 if you're 50 or older (these limits can vary by year).
   - **Investment Options**: Look for low-cost index funds or ETFs within your plan.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Choose Based on Income**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, a Roth IRA might be better since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Max Contribution**: The maximum contribution to an IRA is typically $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts can be used for short-term goals since they are more flexible without withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize tax liabilities.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
- **Aggressive Savings**: Prioritize maxing out your 401(k) to capture any employer match, then contribute to an IRA.
- **Balanced Approach**: After maximizing retirement accounts, consider putting additional savings into a taxable account for flexibility and potential short-term needs.

### Reassess Regularly:
- Adjust your strategy as your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement plans evolve.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice for your specific situation, helping to optimize your asset allocation.
