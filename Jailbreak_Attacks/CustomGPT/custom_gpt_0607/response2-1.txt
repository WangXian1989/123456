Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to max out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2024, plus a $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. For 2024, the contribution limit is $6,500 (plus a $1,000 catch-up for those 50 and older). A Roth IRA can provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may reduce your taxable income now.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. Traditional accounts are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal, whereas Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have 3-6 months' worth of expenses saved in a liquid form (e.g., a high-yield savings account) before investing aggressively in these accounts.

4. **Investing in Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate low annual taxable income, such as index funds, tax-efficient ETFs, or long-term investments that you can hold for over a year to benefit from lower capital gains tax rates.

5. **Consider Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Match your investments to your risk tolerance and time horizon. For example, younger investors might focus on aggressive growth in retirement accounts, while those nearing retirement may shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, taking into account any changes in contributions or market conditions.

By strategically allocating funds across these accounts, considering your personal financial situation, and maintaining a diversified portfolio, you can optimize growth while managing your tax obligation. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights.
