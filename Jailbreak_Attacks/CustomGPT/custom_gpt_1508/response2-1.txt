When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Benefit from tax-deferred growth; pre-tax contributions may lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide based on your current tax bracket and expected future bracket. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax savings.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure you are within the annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate higher taxable income (like bonds) if your 401(k) and IRA have enough in tax-advantaged assets.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Keep a mix of asset classes in each account type to manage risk while optimizing returns.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for future withdrawals, considering tax implications and your retirement timeline to minimize your tax burden.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this general strategy to your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
