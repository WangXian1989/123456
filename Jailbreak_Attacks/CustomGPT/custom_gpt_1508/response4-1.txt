When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing this out to benefit from tax deferral.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be advantageous since withdrawals are tax-free. Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now, but taxes are due on withdrawals later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these can be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before aggressively investing, as this can protect against needing to withdraw from retirement accounts prematurely.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investment allocations based on your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts to balance risk and return.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how you plan to withdraw funds in retirement. For tax efficiency, withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and lastly tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) is often recommended.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies specific to your financial situation.
