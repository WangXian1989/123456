To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Utilize a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Balance Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate. Consider holding stocks or funds here.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) and keep lower-tax investments (like stock index funds) in taxable accounts.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure a balanced mix of equities, bonds, and other asset classes across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.
   - Regularly rebalance to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize taxes. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help preserve tax-advantaged growth in your retirement accounts.

By strategically distributing funds among these accounts, you can optimize tax efficiency and support your long-term financial goals.
