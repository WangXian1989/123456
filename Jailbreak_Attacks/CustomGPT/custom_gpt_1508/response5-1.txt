(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, it's wise to prioritize contributions to accounts that offer tax advantages first. 

1. Maximize your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money.
2. Next, consider taking advantage of a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.
3. Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for any additional investments after maximizing the benefits of your retirement accounts. Make sure to consider your investment strategy and how each account type aligns with your liquidity needs and tax implications on withdrawals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the age-old question of money distributionâ€”like choosing how to slice a pizza! But first, let's be honest: thereâ€™s no one-size-fits-all answer. Itâ€™s all about your vibe and goals. Hereâ€™s a spicy take on it:

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer's throwing in matching funds, treat that like a golden ticket and shove as much as you can into that 401(k) until you hit the match limit. Itâ€™s practically free cash!
   
2. **IRA Next**: Now, itâ€™s time to talk IRAs. Traditional versus Roth? Itâ€™s your call. If you're expecting to be richer than Scrooge McDuck in retirement, a Roth is sweet since you pay taxes now and enjoy tax-free growth later. 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once you've maximized those tax-sheltered accounts, toss any leftover cash into taxable accounts. Itâ€™s where you can do some fun investing without the rules tied to retirement accounts. Just watch out for those tax implications when itâ€™s time to cash out! 

Keep an eye on your investments like you're binge-watching your favorite series. Always adjust your strategy as your financial situation changes. Money moves, baby! ðŸ’°âœ¨
