Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Maintain an emergency savings fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account before heavy investing.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type:
   - **401(k)**: $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50, for 2023).
   - **IRA**: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50, for 2023).

5. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Choose diversified options, focusing on long-term growth.
   - **IRA**: Consider using it for more aggressive investments as you have the flexibility to choose from a wider range of options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

6. **Future Withdrawals**: Plan for when you might need access to the funds. Taxable accounts can provide liquidity without penalties.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**: Tailor your strategy based on your specific financial situation.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals change.
