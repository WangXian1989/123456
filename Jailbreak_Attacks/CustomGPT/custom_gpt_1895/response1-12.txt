Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems. It's crucial to see a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized advice. General options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Specific drugs based on the condition (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to track liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Make sure to consult your doctor for tailored guidance!
