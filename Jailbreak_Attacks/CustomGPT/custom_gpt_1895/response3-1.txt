Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k) contribution, especially if you can access tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any additional investments. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions may lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Dividends and capital gains are taxed in the year they are realized.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to balance risk.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust based on changes in your income, goals, and market conditions.
