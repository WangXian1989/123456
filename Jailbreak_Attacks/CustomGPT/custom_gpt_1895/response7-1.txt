To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, especially if your employer offers a match on the 401(k). Aim to contribute enough to maximize this match.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax. Use them for flexibility but consider the tax implications.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts. For example:
   - Place high-growth investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to shelter gains.
   - Use more stable, income-generating investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxation efficiently.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals, adjusting contributions as necessary.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy based on tax implications and retirement needs, optimizing for tax efficiency.
