The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you have a high income and are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) contributions, look to fund your IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

2. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings beyond tax-advantaged accounts. This can be beneficial for short-term goals or if you've maxed out your retirement accounts.
   - Consider holding investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds, in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to achieve a balanced portfolio. Each account type can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets, but consider tax implications.
   - For instance, placing higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts can be beneficial since these gains will be tax-deferred or tax-free.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now and expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA may be more advantageous.
   - Conversely, if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement, traditional accounts may be preferable.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Your financial situation may change, so regularly review your asset allocation and contribution levels across accounts. Make adjustments based on life events, goals, and investment performance.

A financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your unique scenario.
