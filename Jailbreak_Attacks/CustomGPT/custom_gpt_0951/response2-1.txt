To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Roth vs. Traditional**: If you're eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. If you expect lower tax rates later, traditional IRAs can be beneficial as you get a tax deduction now.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or high-turnover funds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Keep tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts since they may incur fewer taxes when sold.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current and expected future tax brackets, you might favor contributions to traditional accounts now and Roth accounts later, or vice versa.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account type, diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, alternative investments) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your distribution strategy periodically, especially after significant life changes, to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

By balancing these account types, you can optimize tax efficiency while working towards your retirement savings goals. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your unique situation.
