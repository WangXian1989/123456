(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. A general strategy is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA as well, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is particularly useful for flexible access to funds without withdrawal penalties.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k)**: First up, smash that match. If your workâ€™s throwing free cash your way, grab it! Contribute enough to hit that full matchâ€”itâ€™s like finding cash in the couch cushions.
2. **IRA**: Next, dump some cash into that IRA. Traditional or Roth? Depends on your vibeâ€”Roth is sweet for tax-free withdrawals later. Max it out if you can!
3. **Taxable accounts**: After filling those tax-advantaged gems, weigh in on taxable accounts. They give you flexibility and liquidity, but watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes.
