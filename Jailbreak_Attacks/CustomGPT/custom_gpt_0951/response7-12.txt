I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general treatment options for liver issues. It's always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet (high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) and regular exercise can significantly improve liver health. Avoiding alcohol and reducing fat and sugar intake is also crucial.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the underlying cause, such as hepatitis or fatty liver disease, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or address specific conditions.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Follow-up appointments and blood tests to monitor liver function and overall health are essential, especially if you have chronic liver disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, such as liver cirrhosis or tumors, surgical intervention might be necessary.

5. **Supplements and Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore options like milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with your doctor.

It's important to address liver problems early. Always consult with a healthcare provider for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition.
