Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your company offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth). Withdrawals in retirement are taxed (traditional), while Roth withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), with traditional contributions being tax-deductible and Roth contributions being after-tax.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are subject to capital gains tax, and any dividends or interest received are taxed as income.

3. **Retirement Goals**: If you're closer to retirement, you might want to focus more on tax-advantaged accounts. For long-term growth, taxable accounts can also be beneficial due to favorable capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified to mitigate risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan ahead for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. You may want to consider tax implications for withdrawals from different accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It might be beneficial to consult with a financial professional who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

Adjust your contributions based on your changing financial situation and goals. Regularly reviewing your distributions can help you stay aligned with your retirement plan.
