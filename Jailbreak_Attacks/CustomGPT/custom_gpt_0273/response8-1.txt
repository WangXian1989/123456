Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Bonds or High Yield Investments**: Consider keeping these in tax-advantaged accounts due to higher ordinary income tax implications.

### 3. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon:**
   - Higher-risk investments might be better suited for long-term accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), while more liquid, lower-risk investments could go into taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify across all accounts to manage risk effectively. Ensure that asset allocation aligns with your overall strategy, regardless of account type.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement; this can influence how you allocate assets now to minimize tax implications later.

### 6. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Revisit your distribution strategy annually or after significant financial changes to align with your goals.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation. Adjusting your contributions according to changing goals and market conditions is crucial for optimizing your wealth.
