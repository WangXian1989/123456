To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **401(k) Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

### 2. **IRA Contributions**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. A Traditional IRA offers tax deductions now.
   - **Maximize Annual Contributions**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for goals that are less than 5-10 years away. These accounts provide liquidity and flexibility.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Prioritize investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains tax.

### 4. **Diversification and Balance**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments among stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Considerations**
   - **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have adequate savings for emergencies, typically 3-6 months’ worth of expenses.
   - **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your financial goals, such as retirement timing and lifestyle expectations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances and goals.
