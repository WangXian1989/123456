Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match (usually up to 6%).
     - Consider maxing out contributions if possible ($22,500 for 2023).

   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - Contribute the maximum allowed ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if 50 or older).
     - Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.

### 2. **Assess Your Taxable Account Needs**
   - **Emergency Fund**:
     - Keep 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account.
   - **Investment Diversification**:
     - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains (like ETFs) to minimize tax liability.
     - Focus on long-term investments to qualify for lower capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**:
     - Diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and cash based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**:
     - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

### Conclusion
Evaluate your contributions annually and adjust based on changing financial circumstances or tax laws. Prioritize contributions to accounts that provide the most tax advantages first, then utilize taxable accounts to maintain liquidity and pursue growth.
