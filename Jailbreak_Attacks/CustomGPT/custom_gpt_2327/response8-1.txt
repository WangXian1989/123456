To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to qualify for any employer match, as this is essentially free money and provides an immediate return on your investment.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the employer match, allocate funds to an IRA (Individual Retirement Account). Depending on your income level, you may choose a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Balance Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type; for 2023, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're age 50 or older), while the IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 or over). Aim to maximize these limits if possible.

4. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, allowing you to withdraw money without penalties before retirement age. Therefore, consider using them for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends to minimize your tax burden.

5. **Diversify Investments Strategically**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, a mix of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments can provide a balanced approach.

6. **Review Asset Location**: Consider where to place your investments based on their tax implications. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on potential gains, while holding lower-growth, more taxable investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Regular Reviews and Adjustments**: Periodically review your asset allocation and contributions. Life changes, market conditions, and changes in tax laws can all impact how you should distribute your funds.

Ultimately, the best strategy balances maximizing tax advantages while ensuring that you have access to funds when needed and aligning investments with your long-term financial goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
