Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach that aligns with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. 

First, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This can enhance your retirement savings effectively, as the matching contributions provide an immediate return on your investment. Following this, evaluate your IRA options—whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your circumstances best. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions now, deferring taxes until withdrawal, while a Roth IRA enables tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. 

After optimizing these retirement accounts, direct any remaining funds into taxable accounts. This strategy not only provides flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalty, but also offers the opportunity for capital gains that may be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 

Furthermore, consider your investment horizon. Longer-term investments can often withstand market fluctuations, allowing you to focus on growth assets, while shorter-term needs may warrant a more conservative approach with bonds or cash equivalents. Lastly, maintaining a diversified portfolio within each account—spreading investments across asset classes—can further mitigate risks while targeting a balanced growth.

Ultimately, it's prudent to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing life circumstances and market conditions, ensuring your distribution remains aligned with your overarching financial ambitions. Consulting a financial advisor could also provide personalized insights tailored to your specific situation.
