It's imperative to consult a healthcare professional to discuss your specific liver problem, as treatment options can vary widely based on the underlying condition. However, common approaches for managing liver issues often include medications to address underlying diseases, lifestyle alterations such as implementing a healthy diet and exercise routine, and abstaining from alcohol. In more severe cases, treatments may involve procedures such as minimally invasive interventions or, in extreme circumstances, a liver transplant. Always prioritize professional medical advice for tailored treatment options.
