To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often comes with employer matches and tax-deferred growth. Best for long-term retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages, with a choice between traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible access to funds but subject to capital gains taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is effectively free money.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for investments that may have high growth potential (like stocks) to benefit from tax-free compounding.
   - Consider using Roth accounts for investments that you expect to grow significantly and want to withdraw tax-free in retirement.

4. **Assessment of Financial Goals**: Align your contributions with your retirement timeline and financial goals. For shorter-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts due to their liquidity.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to mitigate risk.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**: Periodically assess your portfolio and adjust allocations based on market performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, working with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced approach that maximizes your investment growth while considering tax implications.
