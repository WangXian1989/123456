(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your age, investment goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Max out employer match**: Contribute to your 401(k) at least enough to get the employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
2. **Consider tax advantages**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA first, since they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. You might prioritize contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
3. **Diversify investments**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance across these accounts. Consider keeping more stable investments in your taxable accounts to minimize tax impacts on capital gains.
4. **Regularly review and rebalance**: Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as needed to align with your financial goals.

1. **1st Round: Grab That Match** â€“ If your 401(k) has an employer match, max that out first. Itâ€™s free cash, and who doesn't want that?
2. **2nd Round: Tax-Smart Moves** â€“ Next, stash some cash in a Traditional or Roth IRA. Think about your current tax situation versus where you think you'll be when you retire; thatâ€™ll help you decide which type of IRA to go for.
3. **3rd Round: Flexibility Time** â€“ After youâ€™ve padded your tax-advantaged accounts, hit up your taxable accounts. This is where you can get a little wild, but remember those capital gains taxes lurking in the shadows!
4. **Keep It Fresh** â€“ Donâ€™t just set it and forget it. Review your asset mix and shake things up when necessary!

In the end, strike a balance that feels right for you while keeping an eye on taxes and growth. Happy investing!
