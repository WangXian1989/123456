1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in saturated fats and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Medications to reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Avoid Alcohol**: Complete avoidance of alcohol is crucial for liver health.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging to track liver function.

5. **Supplements**: Some patients may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
