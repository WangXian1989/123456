Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, such as your age, retirement goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a straightforward approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, pay off any high-interest debt to improve your financial health.

3. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the annual limit, especially if there's an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider maximizing your contributions here as well. Traditional IRAs offer tax benefits that can be advantageous depending on your income.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts for greater flexibility, particularly if you plan on needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments across all accounts to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it meets your financial objectives.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
