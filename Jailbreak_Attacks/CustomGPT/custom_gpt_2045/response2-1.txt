Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions are often tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility and potential long-term capital gains tax rates, which can be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

3. **Investment Horizon:**
   - For short-term goals (less than 5 years), keep more in safer investments in taxable accounts or IRAs.
   - For long-term goals, consider stocks or growth-oriented funds in your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts can ride out market fluctuations.

4. **Diversification:**
   - Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Emergency Fund:**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts before investing heavily.

Consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
