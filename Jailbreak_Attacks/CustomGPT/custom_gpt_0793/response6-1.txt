To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
- **401(k)**: Typically offers employer match and tax-deferred growth, but has contribution limits.
- **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Also offers tax advantages; consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA fits your needs based on how you anticipate your tax situation changing.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility in withdrawals without penalties but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money.
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute to your IRA next, optimizing tax benefits. If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Allocate Extra Funds to Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions, use taxable accounts for additional investments, focusing on long-term growth and strategies to minimize taxes.

### 3. Assess Risk Tolerance and Goals:
- Align your investments with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline. More aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize untaxed growth.

### 4. Regularly Review and Adjust:
- Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contributions based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Key Takeaway:
- **Diversification** across account types allows for optimized tax benefits and flexibility. Regular evaluations of your strategy ensure you stay on track to meet your financial goals.
