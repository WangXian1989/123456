Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match—this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget allows.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Keep investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or avoid taxes.
   - Prioritize long-term capital gains in taxable accounts to minimize your tax burden.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a well-rounded asset allocation across all accounts. Avoid overlapping investments to achieve a balanced portfolio.
   - Consider asset location strategies: place stocks in tax-advantaged accounts for growth and hold bonds or income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**
   - Maintain an adequate emergency fund in a high-yield savings account or cash equivalents outside of these retirement accounts for flexibility.

### 5. **Retirement Goals and Time Horizon**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, shift towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA to protect your savings.
   - For a longer time horizon, you may want to be more aggressive, especially in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**
   - Periodically assess your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing financial situation and goals, and rebalance your portfolio as needed.

### Conclusion
It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your specific circumstances. They can help you optimize your investments across these different account types for retirement and beyond.
