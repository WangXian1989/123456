Distributing your money wisely among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, current income, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Retirement Accounts First**: Once you’ve maximized the match, consider maxing out your IRA (if eligible) because it often offers tax advantages. For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This is beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be great for flexibility but consider the tax implications of selling investments (capital gains) and income distributions (dividends).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If you're young, you might lean more toward stocks in your retirement accounts. As you near retirement, gradually shift toward bonds and more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your goals, especially after major life events or changes in income.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, seek personalized advice based on your specific situation.
