(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. A general strategy could involve the following:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation, as these accounts can offer tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. They provide flexibility but don't have the same tax benefits.

Assessing your risk tolerance and investment strategy can also help guide your specific allocations.

1. **401(k) First**: If your boss is throwing free money at you through a match, dive in! Donâ€™t leave that cash on the table.
2. **IRA Goalz**: Next up, hit your IRA max. If you're young, totally go Roth for those sweet tax-free withdrawals later. If you're older, maybe a traditional IRA makes more sense.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After youâ€™ve flexed those retirement accounts, any leftover cash goes into taxable accounts. These are handy for those "oops, I need cash now" moments, but remember, they can bleed you dry with taxes.

So play around with it but keep your eye on the prizeâ€”your future self will thank you!
