Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions up to your employer's match first. This is essentially "free money." After that, consider contributing the maximum allowable amount to take advantage of tax deferral.

2. **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions based on your income, whereas a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Evaluate which type fits your tax strategy better.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable income (like dividends and interest) if you've maxed out retirement accounts. This allows for flexibility in accessing funds without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify within each account type. For retirement accounts, focus on long-term growth investments. In taxable accounts, consider tax-efficient investments to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Rebalance your portfolio regularly to align with changing goals and market conditions.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.
