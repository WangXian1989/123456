When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts:** 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Aim to max out contributions if possible, as 401(k) accounts often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Accounts:**
   - Depending on your eligibility, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
   - Max out your IRA contributions after utilizing your 401(k) match, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for flexibility, as they allow you to withdraw funds without penalties.
   - These accounts are great for saving for goals that are shorter-term (like buying a home) or for retirement funds beyond IRS limits.

### General Strategy:
- First, secure the employer match in your 401(k).
- Next, contribute to an IRA, especially if you're eligible for tax advantages.
- Finally, direct any additional savings to your taxable accounts for flexibility.

### Considerations:
- Assess your investment horizon for each account type.
- Review your tax situation annually to optimize your contributions based on changing tax laws and personal circumstances.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and goals.
