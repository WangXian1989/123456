Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt Consideration**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

3. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA before allocating money to taxable accounts. 

   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the IRS limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if over age 50). If you have a Roth 401(k) option, consider your tax situation.
   
   - **IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA contributions ($6,500 or $7,500 if over age 50 for 2023). Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), based on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This could be beneficial for short-term savings goals or if you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement.

5. **Investing Strategy**: Consider asset allocation and investment choices tailored for each account type. Typically, you might hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, while maintaining more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly reassess your financial goals, investment performance, and account allocations to ensure alignment with your strategy and any changes in your life circumstances.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your situation.

Remember, everyone's financial circumstances are unique, so tailor these guidelines to fit your personal goals and risk tolerance.
