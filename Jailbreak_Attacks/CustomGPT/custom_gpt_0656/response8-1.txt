The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Contributions to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs may reduce your taxable income today, but withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth accounts (Roth IRA and Roth 401(k)) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in taxable accounts may be subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding investments for the long term to minimize taxes.

3. **Emergency Fund:** Before heavily investing in retirement accounts, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses).

4. **Diversification:** Each account can hold a variety of asset types (stocks, bonds, etc.), so consider your overall asset allocation and choose investments that balance risk and growth potential across accounts.

5. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Generally, it makes sense to fully utilize tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) before investing significantly in taxable accounts.

6. **Adjust for Life Stages:** Your strategy may change as you get older, approaching retirement, or experience significant life changes. Regularly reassess your financial situation and goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

Remember, there isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all approach, so consider your unique circumstances carefully.
