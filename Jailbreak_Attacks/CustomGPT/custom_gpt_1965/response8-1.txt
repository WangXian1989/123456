To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally good for higher contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket. Traditional 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The Roth IRA can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Choices**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) for investments that may generate higher taxable income, such as bonds or REITs.
   - Hold stocks or long-term investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risks and investment goals.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement, using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation based on changing market conditions, tax laws, and personal circumstances.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation.
