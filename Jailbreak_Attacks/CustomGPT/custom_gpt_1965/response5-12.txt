I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, limiting alcohol, and avoiding drugs that are harmful to the liver.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a specific diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
