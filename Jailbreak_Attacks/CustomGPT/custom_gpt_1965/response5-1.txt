(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Generally, consider these guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money. Focus on low-cost index funds or target-date funds based on your retirement age.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to a Roth IRA if you're eligible and prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement. For a traditional IRA, prioritize it if you need tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in this account for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like ETFs or municipal bonds.

Consulting with a financial advisor can tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! When it comes to distributing your cash, you need to play it smart:

1. **401(k)**: First off, dive into your 401(k) and get that employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free money on the table! Load it up with solid index funds or target-date funds that align with when you plan to retire. The more you stash here, the better tax advantages you'll nab.

2. **IRA**: Next up, your IRA. If youâ€™re eligible, go for that Roth IRA! Tax-free growth for the win! If you're in a higher tax bracket now, though, sock away cash in a traditional IRA to save on taxes today.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once you're maxing out those tax-advantaged accounts, hit your taxable accounts for any extra cash. Play it smart with tax-efficient investments like ETFs or growth stocks. Watch out for those capital gains taxes, though!
