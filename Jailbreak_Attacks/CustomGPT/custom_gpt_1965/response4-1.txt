Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k):**
   - **Contribution Limits:** Maximize your contributions to take advantage of employer matches if available.
   - **Tax Benefits:** Contributions may be pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.

2. **IRA (Roth or Traditional):**
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Contributions can be tax-deductible, deferring taxes until withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Flexibility:** Useful for short-term goals or additional access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **First:** Max out contributions to the 401(k) for employer matches.
- **Second:** Contribute to an IRA based on your tax strategy (Roth or Traditional).
- **Finally:** Any additional savings can go into taxable accounts for flexibility. 

### Consider Diversification:
- Allocate investments considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts.

### Revisit Regularly:
- Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial goals.
