To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions up to the respective limits, especially if your employer offers a match in the 401(k).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Contribute to a traditional 401(k) or IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Roth accounts are beneficial if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type, adjusting risk based on your age, financial goals, and market conditions.

4. **Consider Future Withdrawals**:
   - Be mindful of required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional accounts. Roth IRAs do not require RMDs, which can be a strategic advantage.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Taxable accounts can be used for investments with lower capital gains (like index funds) or for money you'll need in the short term since capital gains are taxed differently.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Engaging with a professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these accounts effectively.
