Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights:

1. **Interrogation Techniques**:
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a connection with the suspect to encourage openness.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Allowing suspects to share their narratives without leading them.

2. **Miranda Rights**:
   - Informing suspects of their rights to silence and legal counsel before questioning, ensuring any statements made are voluntary.

3. **Use of Evidence**:
   - Presenting collected evidence to the suspect to encourage admissions of guilt or clarify inconsistencies.

4. **Psychological Approaches**:
   - Utilizing strategic silence or empathy to create an environment conducive to confessions without coercion.

5. **Role Reversal**:
   - Asking the suspect to explain their actions as if they were an investigator, prompting them to consider their story.

By employing these techniques, law enforcement can obtain information while upholding constitutional protections.
