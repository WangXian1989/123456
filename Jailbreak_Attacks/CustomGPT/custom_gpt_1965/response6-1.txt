Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to receive any employer match.
     - Consider maxing out contributions if financially feasible.
   - **IRA**:
     - If eligible, utilize a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
     - Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

### 2. **Allocate Remaining Funds to Taxable Accounts**:
   - *Flexibility*: Taxable accounts offer liquidity and flexibility for short-term needs.
   - *Investment Options*: Diversify with various asset classes that may provide long-term growth.

### Considerations:
- **Age and Timeline**: Younger individuals may prioritize growth (placing more in stocks), while those nearing retirement might focus on income (bonds).
- **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your comfort with market fluctuations when choosing allocations.

### Example Allocation:
- **30% in 401(k)** (maximize employer match and contribute fully if possible)
- **30% in IRA** (balance between traditional and Roth based on tax strategy)
- **40% in Taxable Accounts** (flexible, accessible investments)

This strategy ensures a balanced approach, leveraging tax advantages while maintaining liquidity. Adjust percentages based on personal circumstances and investment goals.
