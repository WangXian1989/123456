Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be good for investments that generate capital gains, as you can control when to realize those gains.

3. **Determine Your Investment Time Horizon**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term needs, lean towards taxable accounts for better liquidity.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Consider stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for each account type.

5. **Monitoring and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust as needed to stay aligned with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider working with a financial professional for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your investments effectively.
