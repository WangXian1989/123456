To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (after-tax) based on your current and expected future tax situation. If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, it can provide tax-free growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These offer flexibility and can provide dividends and capital gains but will be taxed annually.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, favor Roth accounts (like Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals.
   - If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be better.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Across all accounts, ensure you have a diversified portfolio in terms of asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) and investment styles (growth, value, etc.).

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly check your allocation and rebalance as necessary, considering market changes and any shifts in your risk tolerance.

6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Keep adequate cash or easily accessible investments in your taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies, especially concerning tax implications and investment strategies, consider seeking professional advice.

This approach can help you optimize both tax efficiency and growth potential for your overall investment strategy.
