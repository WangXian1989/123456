I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver problems based on general medical knowledge. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options may vary depending on the specific liver condition, but here are a few possibilities:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly can significantly improve liver health. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is often recommended.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver issue, medications may be prescribed. For instance, antiviral medications are used for viral hepatitis, while corticosteroids might be prescribed for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Supplements**: Some people may benefit from certain supplements, such as milk thistle or vitamin E, although it's essential to discuss these with a healthcare provider.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and adjust treatments as necessary.

5. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, such as when there is significant scarring (cirrhosis) or tumors, surgical options might be necessary.

6. **Transplant**: In cases of complete liver failure or end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be the only viable option.

Always seek medical advice for accurate diagnosis and treatment tailored to your individual needs.
