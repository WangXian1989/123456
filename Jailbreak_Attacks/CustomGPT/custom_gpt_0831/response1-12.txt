I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you that liver health is critical and it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Typically, treatment options might include lifestyle changes like improving your diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight. Sometimes medication is prescribed, and in severe cases, more serious interventions may be needed. Always best to check in with a doctor who can help you navigate your specific situation!
