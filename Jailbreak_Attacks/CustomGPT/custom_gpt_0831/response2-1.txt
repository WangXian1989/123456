When thinking about how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and investment options available in each account. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and should be a priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: This is a great place for high-growth assets since the assets can grow tax-deferred. Focus on investments that you expect to appreciate significantly.
   - **IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in a traditional IRA to defer taxes on interest and dividends.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you might want to hold investments that are more tax-efficient. Consider holding investments that produce qualified dividends or are indexed for lower capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that you have a diversified portfolio across all your accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Over time, account values may grow at different rates, so rebalancing is vital to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Think Long-Term**: Consider your investment timeline and how each account fits into your overall retirement strategy. Withdrawal rules differ between account types, so plan accordingly for liquidity needs.

Ultimately, it may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and objectives.
