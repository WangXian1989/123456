The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to help you decide:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Decide whether a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA suits you better. If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA (where contributions are made with after-tax dollars) may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you want tax deductions now and expect your tax rate to decrease in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be the way to go.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes and income taxes on dividends and interest. Consider placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in your taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before allocating all your money to investment accounts, ensure that you have a sufficient emergency fund (typically 3-6 months' worth of living expenses).

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Periodically review your asset allocation and adjust as necessary to align with your goals, especially as market conditions change.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a distribution strategy that fits your unique financial situation and objectives.

Keep in mind that these are general principles and the best strategy varies based on individual circumstances.
