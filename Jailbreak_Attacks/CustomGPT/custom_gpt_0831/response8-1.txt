The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and expected retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and a good starting point.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA:** After maximizing the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you might consider a taxable account. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, which can be beneficial if you need access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Consider Tax Implications:** Distribute your investments based on their tax implications. Generally, it’s wise to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts and hold bonds or higher-dividend investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall investment portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and sectors, regardless of the account type.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalancing:** Periodically review your account distributions and investments to ensure alignment with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Rebalance your portfolio as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you’re unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide valuable insights and personalized strategies.

By applying these principles, you can better manage the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to work toward your financial aspirations effectively.
