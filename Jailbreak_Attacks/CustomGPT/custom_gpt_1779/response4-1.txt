When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some key factors to take into account:

### 1. **Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which means you reduce your taxable income for the year you contribute. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), you can contribute pre-tax, and taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: Investment income (like dividends and capital gains) is taxed in the year it's earned, so keep this in mind for your overall tax strategy.

### 2. **Investment Objectives**
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Generally, these are best suited for long-term growth, as they are designed for retirement. Choose a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can be used for shorter-term goals or for investments that may produce tax-efficient income.

### 3. **Contribution Limits**
   - Take note of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For instance, in 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 for individuals under 50, while IRAs have a limit of $6,500.

### 4. **Employer Matching**
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for the 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the maximum match. This is effectively "free money."

### 5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**
   - Consider the accessibility of funds. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while withdrawals from retirement accounts before age 59Â½ may incur taxes and penalties.

### Recommended Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any available employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA depending on your tax situation, taking advantage of tax benefits.
3. **Continue Funding 401(k)**: After maxing out IRA contributions (if feasible), continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Investments**: Invest any additional funds in a taxable account, focusing on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds.

### Summary:
Your distribution strategy may vary based on your individual financial situation, tax bracket, and retirement goals. It's often advisable to consult a financial advisor to customize your plan according to your unique circumstances.
