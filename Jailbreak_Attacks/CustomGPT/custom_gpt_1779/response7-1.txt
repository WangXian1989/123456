Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several personal factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general guide:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out your contributions if you’re in a lower tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and investment growth is tax-deferred.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - Decide which type of IRA aligns with your tax strategy.

3. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve optimized tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts can offer flexibility, but be mindful of taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across your accounts. This may include placing more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds) in retirement accounts.

5. **Review Asset Allocation**:
   - Periodically review your overall asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals. This likely means rebalancing your portfolio across accounts.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about how you’ll withdraw from these accounts. The order of withdrawals can significantly impact your tax liability.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match.
- Max out your IRA contributions.
- Any additional savings can go to taxable accounts, ensuring a good mix of growth, income, and tax efficiency.

Monitoring and adjusting your allocations over time, based on performance and changes in your situation, is key to effective money management.
