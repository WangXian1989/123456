To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Max out your contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. This reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you'll need sooner, as capital gains taxes apply.

2. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a mix of stocks and bonds. Choose low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy to your 401(k), but you may have more investment options.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth, but consider your future income needs. Withdraw from taxable accounts for short-term goals.

4. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
