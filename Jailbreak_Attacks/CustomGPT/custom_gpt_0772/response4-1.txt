Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Continue 401(k) contributions**: After maximizing your employer match and contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to your personal limit.

4. **Consider taxable accounts**: If you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for additional savings. This allows for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

5. **Asset allocation**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance, you might want more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and IRA) and more conservative investments in taxable accounts to mitigate tax implications upon selling.

6. **Review tax implications**: Be mindful of the tax consequences of withdrawals from different accounts. Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

7. **Regularly reassess**: Your financial situation and goals may change, so regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy accordingly.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
