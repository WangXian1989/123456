Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Offered by your employer, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now; taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA:** Individual Retirement Account, which can be a Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (after-tax). Higher contribution limits than IRAs can often lead to significant tax savings.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are regular brokerage accounts where you pay taxes on earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) in the year they occur.

### 2. **Evaluate Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Consider IRA Contributions:** Depending on your eligibility, consider maxing out contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can be advantageous for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts First:** Generally, place assets that are likely to have high growth (like stocks) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) to avoid paying taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts for Investments with Favorable Tax Treatment:** Consider placing bonds or dividend-paying stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize ordinary income tax in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Review Your Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across all account types based on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals.
   - **Rebalancing:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to align with your strategic asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Withdrawals in Retirement**
   - **Plan for Withdrawals:** In retirement, consider which accounts to draw from first to manage your tax liabilities efficiently. Generally, it's recommended to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) to prolong tax-advantaged growth.

### 6. **Adjust as Necessary**
   - **Life Changes:** Be ready to adjust your strategy based on changes in your income, expenses, and financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your specific situation and goals. They can help you navigate complex tax implications and optimize your investments for retirement.
