To optimize your money distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. 
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k), but be mindful of income limits for tax-deductible contributions. 
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: They don't offer immediate tax benefits, but they provide flexibility and easier access to funds without penalties.

3. **Prioritize Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down before aggressive investing.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of investment types (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to manage risk better.

5. **Age and Retirement Goals**: Your asset allocation should evolve based on your age, risk tolerance, and time to retirement. Typically, younger investors might prefer stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement may shift to more conservative investments.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically assess your portfolio across all accounts to maintain your desired allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.
