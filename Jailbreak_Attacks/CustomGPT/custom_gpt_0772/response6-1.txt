Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is effectively "free money."
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A traditional IRA may provide tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Consider keeping investments with lower turnover (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.
   - **Asset Location**: Place income-generating assets (bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes and keep growth-oriented investments (stocks) in taxable accounts to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### 3. **Diversification and Risk Management**
   - **Balance Contributions**: Ensure that you diversify your investments across all accounts, considering your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Different accounts may grow at different rates, requiring adjustments.

### Regular Review:
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Review your contributions and investment allocations periodically, especially after life changes (job change, marriage, etc.) or market fluctuations.

### Conclusion:
Tailoring the distribution of your investments among these accounts will enhance your financial growth while accommodating tax efficiency. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
