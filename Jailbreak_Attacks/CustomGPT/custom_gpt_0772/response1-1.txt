Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you meet the criteria.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but you'll owe taxes on gains and dividends. Keep investments that appreciate in value here to minimize tax impact.
   - **Tax-efficient Investments**: Use index funds or tax-managed funds in taxable accounts to reduce tax liability.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid, easily accessible account.

5. **Long-Term Perspective**:
   - For long-term goals, prioritize growth in retirement accounts. For shorter-term goals, keep more liquidity in taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Re-assess your allocations regularly and adjust based on performance and changing financial needs.
