Ditch the junk food, lower that booze intake, and maybe start doing some cardioâ€”itâ€™s not just for getting ripped! If there are specific meds you need, your doc's gonna hook you up, but keep in mind: sometimes it's about managing causes like fatty liver or hepatitis. And if things ever get gnarly, they might suggest more serious interventions. Stay smart and consult the pros, alright?
