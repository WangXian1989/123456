I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your specific condition. Treatment options for liver problems can vary widely depending on the underlying cause, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. Here are some general options that might be considered:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and sugars can be beneficial. Regular exercise and weight management are also crucial.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, your doctor might prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antiviral drugs for hepatitis.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with your healthcare provider can help monitor liver function and address any issues early on.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: If alcohol consumption is a factor, stopping drinking is vital for liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired, a transplant might be considered.

Always consult your doctor to discuss these options in the context of your health history and current condition.
