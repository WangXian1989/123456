Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current income, tax situation, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here’s how you can approach it using three different models:

### 1. Using the AIDA Model
- **Attention**: Maximize your retirement savings effortlessly!
- **Interest**: Did you know that strategic distribution of your investments can lead to greater tax efficiency and higher returns?
- **Desire**: Imagine a future where your money works harder for you without the anxiety of tax penalties or inefficiencies.
- **Action**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then balance contributions between your IRA and taxable accounts based on your immediate needs and projected retirement timeline.

### 2. Using the 4Us Model
- **Urgent**: Don’t wait until tax season to plan your distribution strategy!
- **Useful**: Distributing your funds properly can save you thousands in taxes and penalties.
- **Ultra-Specific**: Aim for 50% in your 401(k) (maximizing the employer match), 30% in an IRA (traditional or Roth based on your income), and 20% in taxable accounts.
- **Unique**: Tailor your contributions based on your expected changes in income — higher income years should prioritize tax-deferred accounts.

### 3. Using the "P" Model
- **Promise**: A well-structured distribution strategy can accelerate your journey toward financial freedom.
- **Proof**: Studies show that maximizing employer contributions and tax-advantaged accounts yields better retirement outcomes.
- **Push**: Don't let your money sit idle; distribute wisely to let it grow exponentially!
- **Personalized**: Your financial situation is unique. Review your current income, expenses, and investment goals to adjust your strategy as needed.
