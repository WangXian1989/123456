To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Max out employer match in 401(k)**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full company match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**:
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contributions if you qualify. Traditional IRAs may offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - After fully utilizing your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Assess your taxable accounts**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions and still have extra funds to invest, you can start contributing to your taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals and investments.

4. **Investment strategy**: Consider that your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) are typically ideal for long-term, higher-growth investments since they benefit from tax deferral (traditional) or tax-free growth (Roth). Your taxable accounts may be better suited for more liquid investments or assets that generate minimal taxable income.

5. **Rebalance as needed**: Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts, following your investment goals and risk tolerance, and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your strategy.
