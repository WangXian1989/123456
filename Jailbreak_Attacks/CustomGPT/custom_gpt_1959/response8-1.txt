The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Leverage Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it's a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions can be tax-deductible (Traditional) or tax-free upon withdrawal (Roth). Choose the one that aligns best with your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these don’t provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts, they offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments. Use these for short-term goals or as a supplement to your retirement savings.

3. **Consider Investment Horizon**: If you’re investing for long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize tax-advantaged accounts. For shorter-term goals, taxable accounts may be more appropriate.

4. **Diversification**: Make sure to diversify your investments across accounts to spread risk and optimize for tax efficiency.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Ensure you have a consistent saving and investing strategy. Automate contributions where possible to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique circumstances and objectives.
