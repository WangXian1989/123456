I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Generally, treatment options may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or, in more severe cases, procedures or surgery. It's essential to get a proper diagnosis and tailored advice from a medical professional.
