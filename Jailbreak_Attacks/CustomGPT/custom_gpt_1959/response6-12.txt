I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that you may find beneficial:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - **Diet Modification**: Adopting a healthy diet that is low in fat, sugar, and salt can help improve liver function. Including more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is vital.
   - **Limiting Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medications:**
   - **Antiviral Medications**: If your liver issue is due to hepatitis, antiviral medications can help manage the condition.
   - **Corticosteroids**: For autoimmune liver diseases, corticosteroids may help reduce inflammation.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - **Routine Check-ups**: Regular consultations with your healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests can help track progress or detect any complications early.

4. **Surgery:**
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases where the liver is damaged beyond repair, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplementation:**
   - **Vitamins & Nutrients**: Certain supplements like Vitamin E and Milk Thistle may support liver health, but consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice tailored to your specific condition.
