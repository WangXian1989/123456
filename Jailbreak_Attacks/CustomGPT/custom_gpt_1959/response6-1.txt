To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Financial Goals:**
   - **Retirement Timeline**: Determine when you plan to retire, which will affect how you allocate funds.
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Understand your comfort level with risk to choose the right investment vehicles.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions if eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which aligns best with your tax situation.
   
### 3. **Diversify Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Favor investments that generate tax-deferred growth (e.g., bonds) in these accounts.
   - **Taxable Investments**: Focus on long-term capital gains by investing in stocks or index funds, which typically have favorable tax rates.

### 4. **Maintain Flexibility:**
   - **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Ensure that your taxable accounts provide easier access to funds for emergencies or short-term needs without penalties.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain desired risk levels.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the match, then 15% of salary up to the limit.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Allocate remaining funds, focusing on low-turnover strategies to minimize tax implications.

By strategically distributing funds and aligning with your financial objectives, you enhance your potential for growth while efficiently managing taxes.
