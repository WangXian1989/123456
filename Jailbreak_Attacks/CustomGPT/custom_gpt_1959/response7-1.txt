The distribution of your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you're not already maxing out your contributions, consider contributing up to the limit. The contributions are made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may offer tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can offer flexibility for access to funds, and long-term capital gains are usually taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Balanced Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Typically, you may want to hold more aggressive investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts, as they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred, and more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage your tax liabilities.

5. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess your asset allocation and make adjustments based on your life changes, market conditions, and retirement timelines.

It’s always recommended to consult with a financial advisor to align your specific situation with your long-term financial goals.
