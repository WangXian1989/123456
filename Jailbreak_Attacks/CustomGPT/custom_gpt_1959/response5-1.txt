(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize maximizing your employer match in your 401(k) first, as this is essentially "free money." After that, you may want to consider contributing to an IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth. Finally, if you have additional funds to invest, you can allocate them to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.
