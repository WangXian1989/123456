(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA (whether Roth or traditional, depending on your tax situation). IRAs often have more investment choices compared to 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. This is especially important if you want greater liquidity or you're close to retirement.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to reduce potential capital gains taxes. Also, consider asset location strategies; for instance, keep bonds in tax-advantaged accounts where they wonâ€™t generate taxable interest.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.
