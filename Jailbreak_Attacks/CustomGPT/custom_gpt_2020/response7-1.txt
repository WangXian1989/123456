Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**
   - **Tax Rates**: Use pre-tax accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. Go for Roth accounts if you expect to be in a higher bracket.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals based on which accounts will be taxed more efficiently in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**
   - **401(k)**: Invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Similar strategy as your 401(k), but you may have more investment choices.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use this for investments that generate capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs).

### 4. **Regularly Rebalance**
   - Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure that you’re maintaining your desired risk level and reallocating as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

### 5. **Emergency Fund and Short-term Savings**
   - Maintain a separate liquid emergency fund outside these accounts to avoid early withdrawals and penalties.

### Conclusion
Tailor your strategy based on your personal situation and financial goals. Consultation with a financial advisor can also provide customized advice.
