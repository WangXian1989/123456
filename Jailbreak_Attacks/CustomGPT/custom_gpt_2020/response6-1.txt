Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits; consider traditional vs. Roth depending on your tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains, but offer liquidity.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Consider IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for further tax advantages. Max out contributions if possible.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use these for additional investments to maintain flexibility.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) for long-term appreciation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Include a mix of stocks and bonds; consider tax-efficient funds to minimize annual tax burden.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust asset allocation annually to align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Efficient Withdrawal**: Plan withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impact, often withdrawing from taxable accounts first.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Personalized advice can provide tailored strategies based on your specific financial situation.

By carefully planning your contributions across these accounts, you can maximize growth while minimizing tax implications.
