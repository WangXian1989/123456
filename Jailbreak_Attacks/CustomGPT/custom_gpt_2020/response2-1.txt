Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available.
   - **Investment Options**: Typically offers a range of mutual funds; choose low-cost options.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes upon withdrawal.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are due upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, particularly for short-term goals or needs.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments; holding investments for over a year can lower your tax rate.

### **Allocation Strategy**
1. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to the match and then consider funding an IRA (preferably a Roth if you're eligible).
2. **Balance Contributions**: If you have additional funds after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to taxable accounts.
3. **Revisit Annually**: Adjust your strategy based on income changes, life events, or shifts in your financial goals.

### **Considerations**
- **Age**: Younger investors may prefer Roth accounts for long-term growth potential. Older investors might prioritize tax-deferred accounts to manage taxable income in retirement.
- **Investment Time Horizon**: Longer timelines may allow for more aggressive investments in taxable accounts, while shorter timelines may require more conservative allocations.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.
