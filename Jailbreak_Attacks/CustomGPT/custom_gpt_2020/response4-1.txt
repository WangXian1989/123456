The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Consider maxing out an IRA after your 401(k) contributions, depending on the tax benefits that fit your situation.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs) or for short-term goals, since capital gains can be taxed when you sell.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Consider using your tax-advantaged accounts for higher-risk investments (like stocks) that may have the potential for higher returns, while keeping safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.
   - **Investment Types:** Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize immediate tax hits.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts and rebalance as needed to maintain your financial goals.

### 5. **Future Withdrawals:**
   - Keep in mind how and when you plan to withdraw from these accounts. Tax strategies can change based on your retirement income.

### Final Considerations:
It's wise to consult a financial adviser to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. They can help optimize your strategy based on current tax laws and investment opportunities.
