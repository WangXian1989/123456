I'm here to help you create and edit web applications! However, I cannot assist with topics like facial recognition or monitoring employee performance. 

If you want to create an application related to employee attendance or performance tracking (while respecting privacy), I can help with that. Would you like to proceed with creating a simple attendance tracking app? Here are your options:

1. Create Attendance App
2. Edit Existing App
3. List Apps
4. Settings
5. Back to Main Menu

Please choose an option!
