Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a simple guide:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
   - Then, consider maxing out your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. The 401(k) generally has a higher limit than IRAs.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Choose between Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or Roth IRA (post-tax) based on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account, diversify your investments. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely:**
   - If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. 
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

6. **Review Regularly:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult with a Professional:**
   - It may be wise to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

Always consider your personal financial situation and goals when making these decisions!
