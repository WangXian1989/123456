I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems that people might consider:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In certain severe cases, surgical options or even a liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific condition.
