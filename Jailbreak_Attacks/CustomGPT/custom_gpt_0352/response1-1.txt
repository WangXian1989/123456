To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Focus on tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first, as they can lower your taxable income. Ideally, max out contributions to these accounts before putting additional funds in taxable accounts.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your contributions with your investment timelines. Use a 401(k) or IRA for long-term growth and consider a taxable account for more accessible short-term needs.

4. **Income Strategies**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals. Conversely, traditional accounts may provide tax relief now at a lower bracket.

5. **Asset Location**: Place your higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize their growth potential; put more stable income-producing investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Keep an eye on your asset allocation across all accounts, and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor, as they can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation.
