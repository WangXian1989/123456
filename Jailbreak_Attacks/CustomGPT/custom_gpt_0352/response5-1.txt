(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Generally, it's a good idea to prioritize contributions to accounts with tax advantages. Hereâ€™s a common strategy:

1. **Max out your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if you qualify for tax deductions.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. This allows you more flexibility, such as accessing funds before retirement without penalties.

Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

1. **401(k) First**: Hit that employer match like itâ€™s free money (because it is!). Thatâ€™s practically a bonus on your paycheck, dude!
2. **IRA Love**: Next up, throw some cash into an IRA. Go traditional for those sweet tax deductions or Roth if you wanna flex on tax-free withdrawals later. 
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Finally, once youâ€™ve maxed out the fun stuff, toss some dough into a taxable account. This is where you can play more freely with investments and actually access your cash without retirement roadblocks.

But hey, everyoneâ€™s situation is different, so consider chatting with a financial guru to whip up a plan that works best for your cash flow and lifestyle. You've got this!
