Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Prioritize maximizing contributions within your 401(k) limit.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible since withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can offer immediate tax advantages.

2. **Balance Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider keeping more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or ETFs) and less tax-efficient ones (like bond funds) in tax-advantaged accounts. 

3. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover unexpected expenses, typically 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses.

4. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investments and minimize tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
