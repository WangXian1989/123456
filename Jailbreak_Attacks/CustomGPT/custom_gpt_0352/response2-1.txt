The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA since they offer tax benefits. Focus on maximizing employer match in a 401(k) before contributing to an IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Contributions to traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes until withdrawal. In contrast, taxable accounts are taxed on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Depending on your current tax bracket, it might be wise to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Use your 401(k) and IRAs for more growth-oriented investments, as you won't need to access those funds for a while. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

4. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: Younger investors may benefit from a heavier allocation towards growth in retirement accounts, while those closer to retirement might prefer more stable investments and might prioritize cash flow in taxable accounts.

5. **Establish an Emergency Fund**: Before maximizing retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund in place, typically in a savings account or other liquid assets.

6. **Review Regularly**: Continually assess your financial situation, investment performance, and changes in tax law to adjust your strategy as needed.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
