I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options tailored to your specific liver issues. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, or specialized procedures depending on the severity and type of liver condition. Always prioritize getting expert medical advice.
