Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a broad approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 
   - Consider maxing out the IRA if you are below the contribution limits.

### 3. **Back to 401(k)**
   - After maxing out the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), especially if you have a high income and tax implications.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or when you need liquidity. 
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - Understand the tax treatment of each account:
     - **401(k)** & **Traditional IRA**: Taxes on withdrawals.
     - **Roth IRA**: Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

### 6. **Balanced Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify investments across these accounts to manage risk. 

### Final Thought
Tailor your strategy to your specific situation, considering factors like age, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights. 

Happy planning!
