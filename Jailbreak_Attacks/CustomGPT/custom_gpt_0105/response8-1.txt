To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. 

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Use conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to reduce taxable income.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across different asset classes to spread risk.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Future Tax Context**:
   - Anticipate your future tax situation. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, consider contributing more to Roth accounts.

7. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid funds outside these accounts for emergencies.

Tailoring this distribution to your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon is essential. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice.
