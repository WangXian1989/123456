Iâ€™m not a doctor, but I can suggest some common treatment options for liver issues. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Here are some options that might be discussed:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Adopt a healthy diet (low in fats and sugars).
   - Increase physical activity.

2. **Medication:**
   - Antiviral medications for viral hepatitis.
   - Supplements for liver support (e.g., milk thistle).

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Routine blood tests to monitor liver function.
   - Imaging tests (ultrasound or MRI) to assess liver health.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplantation may be considered.

Always consult a healthcare provider for the best course of action tailored to your specific condition.
