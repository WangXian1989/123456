Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on eligibility and tax implications.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are tax-deferred, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made post-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments; favor long-term investments to minimize taxes.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance:** Align investments with your risk tolerance; consider higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - **Diversification:** Ensure a balanced portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan when and how to withdraw funds in retirement to minimize tax impact—consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first.

### 5. **Rebalance Periodically**
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

By strategically prioritizing contributions to accounts based on tax benefits and growth potential, you can optimize your investment outcomes.
