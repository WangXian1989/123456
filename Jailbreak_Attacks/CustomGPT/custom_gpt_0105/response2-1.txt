Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. If your employer offers matching, contribute enough to get the maximum match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for emergency funds or short-term goals. Use retirement accounts for long-term growth.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the annual contribution limits for each account type. Maximize contributions where possible, especially for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts based on your risk tolerance. Consider age-appropriate asset allocation (more stocks when younger; more bonds as you near retirement).

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals: taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, while retirement accounts may have restrictions.

### Suggested Approach:
1. **Maximize employer match in your 401(k)**.
2. **Contribute to an IRA (preferably Roth if you can afford taxes now)**.
3. **Invest in taxable accounts for additional savings and liquidity**.

### Regular Review:
Regularly review and adjust your allocation based on changing financial goals and market conditions. Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your situation.
