To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to the employer match, then contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on eligibility and tax considerations.
  
2. **Diversification**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your risk tolerance and investment goals.

3. **Withdrawal Considerations**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications for each account. Generally, funds from taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains, while distributions from retirement accounts can be taxed as ordinary income.

4. **Long-Term Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your retirement timeline. Funds in 401(k) and IRA accounts will grow tax-deferred, making them suitable for long-term growth.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly check and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation across accounts.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and retirement goals.

This balanced approach will help you optimize tax benefits and growth potential over time.
