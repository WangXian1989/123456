To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. If your employer offers a Roth option, consider it for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, either your contributions may be tax-deductible or your withdrawals may be tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that are likely to generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate compared to ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust allocations to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can tailor your strategy to your specific circumstances.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced approach to wealth distribution across your accounts, maximizing benefits while minimizing taxes.
