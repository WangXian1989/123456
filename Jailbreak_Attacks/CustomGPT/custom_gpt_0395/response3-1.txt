Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a balanced approach based on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA**: Consider opening a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer an immediate tax deduction, contribute to a traditional IRA.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and traditional IRAs) are beneficial for those who expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - Roth accounts are ideal for those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Diversification in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.
   - Consider municipal bond funds, which can offer tax-free interest.

4. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Continuously review and adjust your portfolio to maintain desired asset allocation based on performance and market conditions.

6. **Financial Goals and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your short-term and long-term goals.
   - Assess your risk tolerance to decide how aggressive or conservative to be.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced distribution strategy that maximizes growth while managing risk and taxes effectively.
