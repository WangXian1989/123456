To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.

2. **Understand Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Put investments that generate higher taxes (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you'll hold long-term to benefit from capital gains tax rates.

4. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance. 
   - Keep more aggressive investments in tax-deferred accounts and more stable investments in taxable ones.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan for future withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes overall.
   - Consider tax implications of withdrawing from each account type based on your retirement income needs.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can provide personalized guidance based on your financial situation and goals.

### Summary
Start with maximizing contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, allocate assets wisely, and monitor regularly. This balanced approach can help you grow your wealth efficiently over time.
