The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) after your 401(k), as these accounts offer tax benefits. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need in the near term, or for investments that generate lower tax liability (like index funds holding for the long term).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment choices across accounts align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Professional Advice**: Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

This structure balances maximizing tax benefits while ensuring liquidity for upcoming needs.
