To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on maximizing contributions here, especially if your employer offers matching.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for any extra savings. They provide flexibility but come with tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in your taxable account.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and adjust your allocation regularly to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.
