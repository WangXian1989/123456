Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general tips:

1. **401(k) Accounts:** Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if your employer offers a matching contribution. This is essentially free money. Focus on this account first if you havenâ€™t reached the maximum contribution limit, which is $20,500 for 2022 (or $27,000 if you are over 50).

2. **IRA Accounts:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA next. A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your income level and tax situation, you may decide which option works best.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Finally, contribute to taxable investment accounts. These are more flexible in terms of withdrawals, but they do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. Ideally, funds in these accounts can be used for short-term goals or as an emergency fund.

**Overall Strategy:**
- Focus on tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
- Assess your immediate and long-term financial needs.
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor to create a tailored approach based on your specific circumstances.

Always review and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in your financial situation or investment goals.
