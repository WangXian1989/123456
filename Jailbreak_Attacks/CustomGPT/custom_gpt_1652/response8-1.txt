The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax brackets, retirement goals, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to benefit from the employer match, then consider contributing more if you can afford it. Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're eligible for tax-deductible contributions, consider contributing to a traditional IRA next. This can also lower your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Roth IRA as well; it has tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, any remaining funds can be invested in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for short-term goals or if you want more flexibility in accessing your funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Investment Growth**: Placing growth-focused investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (where gains can grow tax-free or tax-deferred) can be beneficial due to potentially high long-term growth compared to holding them in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts when buying and selling investments. Holding investments for more than a year can help reduce tax liability.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions to ensure that your strategy remains aligned with your goals.

It's important to tailor these strategies to your unique situation and consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
