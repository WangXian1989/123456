When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the maximum match since it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. However, when you withdraw in retirement, they are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, but you'll pay capital gains tax on profits when selling investments.

3. **Investment Goals**: Determine your investment goals and risk tolerance. Long-term growth might mean prioritizing IRAs or 401(k)s due to their tax advantages, while more liquid, short-term needs might lead you to prioritize taxable accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively.

5. **Age and Time Horizon**: Younger investors might lean more towards growth-oriented investments in 401(k) and IRA, while those closer to retirement might shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Consider Fees**: Analyze any fees associated with your 401(k) and compare them with other investment options to ensure cost-effectiveness.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your unique financial situation.

In summary, prioritize contributing to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, followed by maxing out IRA contributions, and then consider taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.
