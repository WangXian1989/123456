The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are a few general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it offers tax-free growth.
  
2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) to reduce your taxable income.
   - In lower income years, you might benefit from tax-free growth in a Roth IRA or using taxable accounts for investments.

3. **Emergency Funds and Liquidity Needs**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of your retirement accounts. This should cover 3-6 months' worth of expenses.
   - Taxable accounts can provide liquidity for short-term needs without penalties for withdrawals.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. 
   - High-growth investments may be best suited for tax-advantaged accounts, while conservative investments can fit well in taxable accounts.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your personal circumstances!
