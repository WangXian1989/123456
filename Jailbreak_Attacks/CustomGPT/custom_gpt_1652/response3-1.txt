Distributing your money strategically among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is essential for optimizing your investment growth and tax efficiency. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to at least get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k), particularly if you are in a high tax bracket, as contributions are made pre-tax and grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA based on your eligibility. A Traditional IRA may provide a tax deduction, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income or short-term capital gains, like stocks that you plan to sell in the near future. This strategy can be more tax-efficient.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure you diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) regardless of the account type. This reduces risk and volatility.

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: Allocate more aggressive investments (stocks) in accounts meant for long-term growth (like a 401(k) or IRA) and shift to more stable investments (bonds or cash) as you approach retirement.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your investment allocations in each account to stay aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Itâ€™s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a specific strategy to your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

In summary, focus on maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, utilize any employer matches, and strategically allocate to taxable accounts as needed, always keeping in mind diversification and your long-term goals.
