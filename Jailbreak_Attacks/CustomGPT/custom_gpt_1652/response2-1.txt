Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to a Roth IRA (if eligible)**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This can be particularly advantageous if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Strive to max out your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 or older).

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts Wisely**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account. This should be focused on investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs that have lower turnover rates.

5. **Diversify Asset Allocation**: Ensure that your investment allocation reflects your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Younger investors may favor a more aggressive stock allocation, while those closer to retirement might prefer more bonds or safer investments.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in a taxable account, as capital gains taxes can affect your overall returns.

7. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired risk level and to adjust for life changes or shifts in the market.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your individual financial situation.

By following these strategies and remaining informed about your investments, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
