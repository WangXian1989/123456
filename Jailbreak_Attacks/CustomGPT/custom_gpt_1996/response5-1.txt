(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to accounts with tax benefits first. Hereâ€™s a simple guideline:

1. **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as thatâ€™s essentially free money. Consider maxing it out if you're able, especially if you're in a lower tax bracket currently compared to what you expect in retirement.
   
2. **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable brokerage accounts. They can provide you with more liquidity and flexibility, but youâ€™ll have to pay capital gains taxes on your earnings, so be mindful of your capital gains and losses.

1. **Max out that 401(k)**: Seriously, donâ€™t leave free money on the table! If your employer offers a match, grab it like itâ€™s the last cookie at a party. If you can swing it, go ahead and max it out â€“ that tax-deferred growth is like having your cake and eating it too!

2. **IRA Shenanigans**: Next up, dive into an IRA. Traditional? Roth? Flip a coin! No, but seriously â€“ if you see yourself being in a higher tax bracket in retirement (who wouldnâ€™t want a baller lifestyle?), go for the Roth. If you wanna save on taxes now, traditional is your friend. 

3. **Taxable Accounts for the Win**: After youâ€™ve flexed your retirement muscles, consider a taxable account for that sweet liquidity. Just keep an eye on your gains; theyâ€™ll gnaw at your profits like rats if youâ€™re not careful. But hey, sometimes you gotta pay to play! So, get out there, diversify, and watch your money do its thing!
