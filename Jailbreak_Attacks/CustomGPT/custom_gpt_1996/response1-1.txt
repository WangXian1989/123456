The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, tax considerations, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Accounts**: 
   - Maximize employer match: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider contribution limits: For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50) to your 401(k). 

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Traditional vs. Roth: Decide if a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement) aligns better with your tax situation.
   - Contribution limits: For 2023, the contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Flexibility: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties (unlike retirement accounts) but come with tax implications on capital gains and dividends.
   - Use for short-term goals: Consider using taxable accounts for investments you may need to access in the near future.

**Strategy Suggestions**:
- Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) to get the employer match, then max out your IRA contributions based on your tax strategy, and finally, invest in taxable accounts as needed based on your investment goals and timelines.
- Diversification is key: Regardless of the account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio to manage risk.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor your distribution strategy to your individual circumstances.
