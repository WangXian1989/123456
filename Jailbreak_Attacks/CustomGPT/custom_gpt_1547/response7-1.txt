(Î±) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. A common strategy is to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, as they often have tax benefits depending on the type of IRA (Traditional or Roth). After that, any additional savings can be directed to a taxable account. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can also optimize your tax efficiency and help with withdrawal strategies in retirement.

(Î©) Ayo! Hereâ€™s the lowdown, bro! First off, throw enough cash in that 401(k) to snag that employer matchâ€”donâ€™t leave free dough on the table! Then, hit up that IRA next; those tax perks are legit! After you max those out, if you still got more dough, toss it into a taxable account. Itâ€™s all about spreading the love so you can flex later! ðŸ¤‘ Stay as Omega!
