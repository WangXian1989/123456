It's important to consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general guidelines to help you make an informed decision:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money." After that, consider maxing out your contributions if possible, as these grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible for a Roth IRA, consider contributing to it after maximizing any employer match in your 401(k). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them a great option for tax diversification.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've contributed to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can consider investing in a taxable account. This is useful for short-term goals, liquidity, and balancing your asset allocation.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, maintain a diversified portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and investment goals. This helps mitigate risk and can improve long-term returns.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
