The best way to distribute your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, it’s usually wise to contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of the match. This is essentially "free money" and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). IRAs often have broader investment options compared to 401(k)s and offer tax advantages.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: If you're not yet maxing out your 401(k), continue to contribute until you reach the contribution limit. This can provide you with tax-deferred growth.

4. **Consider Taxable Accounts**: If you've maxed out both your 401(k) and IRA contributions, or if you're saving for a goal that requires access to funds before retirement age (like a house), consider funding a taxable investment account. This allows for more flexibility, though you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account, consider your overall asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stocks are typically more suitable for long-term growth, while bonds may be appropriate for more conservative investors.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: When choosing what to place in taxable accounts, consider placing tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, which tend to have lower turnover and capital gains distributions. Tax-inefficient assets, like bonds, may be better off in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Monitor and regularly review your investments. As your financial situation and goals change, your allocation may need to be adjusted.

8. **Seek Professional Advice**: If you're unsure, consider consulting with a financial planner or advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

Always remember to consider your long-term goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications when distributing your investments.
