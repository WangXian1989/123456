To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts provide tax benefits. The 401(k) may offer an employer match, which is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, Roth IRA contributions (after-tax) might be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect a lower tax bracket, traditional accounts (pre-tax) may be advantageous.

### 2. **Liquidity Needs**
   - **Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds you might need in the near future (e.g., for emergencies or major purchases) in taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 3. **Investment Allocation**
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes. Keep tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts to make the most of favorable capital gains rates.

### 4. **Contribution Limits**
   - Understand the limits on contributions for each account type and prioritize them accordingly. For 2024, the contribution limits are:
     - **401(k)**: $23,000 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older)
     - **IRA**: $7,000 (or $8,000 if age 50 or older)

### Conclusion
Balancing your contributions based on tax efficiency, liquidity needs, investment strategy, and contribution limits will optimize your overall investment growth. It may also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific financial situation and goals.
