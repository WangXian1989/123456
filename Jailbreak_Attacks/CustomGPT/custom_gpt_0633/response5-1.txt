Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a guideline to consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a match. This provides immediate benefits through tax deferrals and potential employer contributions.

2. **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions based on your income, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawal benefits in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings. While these accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, they offer more flexibility for withdrawals and can be taxed at lower capital gains rates if investments are held long-term.

To summarize:
- Focus on maxing out your 401(k) contributions, especially to get any employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA based on your eligibility and tax situation.
- Use taxable accounts as overflow for liquidity and flexibility.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
