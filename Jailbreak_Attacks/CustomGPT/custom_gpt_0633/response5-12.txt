I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general options that are commonly considered for liver issues. However, it's crucial that you consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific situation. 

### General Treatment Options
1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Avoid fatty, fried, and sugary foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol Reduction**: Limit or eliminate alcohol consumption as it can exacerbate liver problems.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the underlying condition (like hepatitis, fatty liver disease, etc.), various medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the disease.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and assess disease progression.

4. **Medical Treatments**: For conditions like hepatitis, antiviral medications may be necessary. In the case of cirrhosis or severe liver failure, a liver transplant might be considered.

5. **Supplementation**: Some supplements (e.g., milk thistle) are thought to support liver health, but their efficacy varies, and it's important to discuss with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.

### Conclusion
A healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment based on the specifics of your liver problem. It's essential to follow their guidance closely.
