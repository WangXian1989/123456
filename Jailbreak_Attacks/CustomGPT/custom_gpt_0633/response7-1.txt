Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and your time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Consider both Traditional and Roth IRAs. A Traditional IRA allows pre-tax contributions which can reduce your taxable income now, while a Roth IRA lets your investments grow tax-free.

2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)).
   - For those expecting a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial since you’ll pay less tax when withdrawing in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. This can provide flexibility for withdrawing funds without penalties and can be beneficial for short-term goals.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks) which can benefit more from tax deferral. 
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding lower-growth investments (bonds, dividend-paying stocks) to minimize tax liability on capital gains and interest.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on changes in tax laws, your financial situation, and goals.

It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
