To optimize your investment strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **401(k)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (e.g., stocks) since these accounts are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Roth or Traditional, blend growth assets and some conservative investments considering your retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Prioritize tax-efficient investments with lower turnover (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation across all accounts to maintain your desired risk level.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first to defer taxes on tax-advantaged accounts as long as possible.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Planner**
   - Tailor your strategy based on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications.

This balanced approach can help you maximize growth while managing tax liabilities effectively.
