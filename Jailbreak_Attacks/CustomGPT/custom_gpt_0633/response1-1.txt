Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to take full advantage of any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (whether traditional or Roth, based on your income and tax situation).

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are often tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now but leading to taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Build Your Taxable Account Last**
   - Invest in a taxable account after maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts. This allows more capital to grow tax-deferred.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in a taxable account.

### 4. **Diversify Your Investments**
   - Regardless of the account type, aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Regularly Reassess Your Strategy**
   - Review your investments and allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure they remain aligned with your goals and market conditions.

### Additional Considerations
- **Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger investors may lean more towards aggressive growth strategies, while those nearing retirement may prioritize stability.
- **Debt**: Consider paying down high-interest debt before making significant investments.

### Conclusion
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance to optimize your investment strategy based on your specific situation.
