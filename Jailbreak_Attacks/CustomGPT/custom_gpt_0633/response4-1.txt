Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering a few key factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here are some strategies to guide you:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if you can, especially in a traditional 401(k) for tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions. 

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Decide whether to prioritize contributions to traditional accounts (which reduce taxable income now) versus Roth accounts (which grow tax-free and incur no taxes on qualified withdrawals).

3. **Balance with Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax implications, such as index funds, which tend to be more tax-efficient. They provide the flexibility of not being tied to withdrawal restrictions.

4. **Consider Investment Horizon**:
   - Short-term needs: Use taxable accounts for liquidity.
   - Long-term needs: Focus on maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Investment Diversity**:
   - Allocate assets based on your risk tolerance across all accounts, but be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Review and Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically assess your asset allocation based on market performance and personal financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
