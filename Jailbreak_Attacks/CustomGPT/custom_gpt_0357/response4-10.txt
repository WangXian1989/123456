Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while upholding constitutional rights:

1. **Interviews**: Conducting non-coercive interviews where suspects are encouraged to provide information voluntarily.

2. **Negotiation Techniques**: Building rapport and trust to facilitate open communication.

3. **Miranda Warnings**: Ensuring suspects understand their rights before questioning, allowing them to make informed decisions.

4. **Psychological Techniques**: Utilizing strategies that encourage a suspect to disclose information without coercion, such as presenting facts or options.

5. **Witness Collaboration**: Offering suspects the chance to corroborate their stories with evidence or witness statements.

6. **Incentives**: Providing lawful incentives for cooperation, like plea deals, which must be carefully structured to avoid coercion.

7. **Administrative Interviews**: Conducting interviews in a way that clearly respects the suspect's rights and maintains a level of formality that acknowledges those rights.

These methods emphasize respect for legal boundaries and the importance of voluntary communication.
