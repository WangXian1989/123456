I'm not a doctor, but the best treatment options for liver issues can vary depending on the specific condition. Generally, options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintaining a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and exercising regularly.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications can help manage symptoms or address underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).
3. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from vitamin E or milk thistle, but consult your doctor first.
4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
