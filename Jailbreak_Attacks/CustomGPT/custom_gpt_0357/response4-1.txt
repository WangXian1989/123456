Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider maxing out an IRA. If you qualify for a Roth IRA, it can be beneficial for tax-free growth.

2. **Balance the Accounts**:
   - For long-term growth, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts first due to tax benefits.
   - Place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**:
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (e.g., ETFs, index funds) that generate minimal taxable income.
   - Consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid taxation.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is far off, lean more into growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - As you near retirement, shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Review Tax Implications**:
   - Understand the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type. Traditional accounts are taxed upon withdrawal, while Roth accounts are not.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and personal circumstances.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your specific situation.
