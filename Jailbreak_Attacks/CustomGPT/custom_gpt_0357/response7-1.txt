Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this contribution. Look at whether itâ€™s a traditional (pre-tax) or Roth (after-tax) 401(k).
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for more flexibility and easier access to money for short-term goals.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach ensures you make the most of tax advantages while remaining flexible for future needs.
