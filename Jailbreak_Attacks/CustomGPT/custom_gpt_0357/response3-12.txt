I'm not a doctor, but common treatment options for liver issues include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and regular exercise.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may control symptoms or manage underlying causes.
3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.
