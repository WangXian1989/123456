Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This provides tax advantages that can enhance growth.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing the IRA, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the limit to further benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or short-term investment goals. These accounts offer flexibility but may incur capital gains taxes on earnings.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Important Considerations:
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments within each account according to your risk tolerance.
- **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for when you might access these funds, considering potential taxes and penalties.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personalized advice can help navigate your specific situation.

This strategy balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential.
