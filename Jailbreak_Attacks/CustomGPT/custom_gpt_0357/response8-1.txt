The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Prioritize contributions here to benefit from pre-tax contributions and potential employer matches.
   - **IRA**: After maxing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Once you maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate any additional savings to taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax on profits.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Determine an appropriate asset allocation strategy based on your risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Generally, stocks are better for long-term growth while bonds are suitable for stability.

### 5. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a separate savings account, covering 3 to 6 months’ worth of expenses before heavily investing.

### 6. **Rebalancing**
   - Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you’re unsure about the best strategy, consulting a financial planner can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

### Conclusion
Start by maximizing tax-advantaged accounts before moving to taxable investments, and always keep an eye on your overall financial strategy and goals.
