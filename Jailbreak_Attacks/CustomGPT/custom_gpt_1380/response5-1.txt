(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. A common approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first, as these generally offer tax advantages. In particular, if your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), it's advisable to contribute at least enough to get the full match. After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider how much to allocate to your taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment strategy. Using a diversified portfolio across all three account types can help with risk management while aiming for growth.
