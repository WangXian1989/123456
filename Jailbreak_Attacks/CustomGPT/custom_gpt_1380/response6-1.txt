To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - *Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts*: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA to take advantage of tax deferrals. This reduces your taxable income in the current year and allows your investments to grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - *Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility*: Keep money in taxable accounts for investments that may yield long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

2. **Asset Allocation**:
   - *Higher Growth Assets in Tax-Advantaged Accounts*: Invest in higher-growth assets (like stocks) within your 401(k) and IRA. Since withdrawals will be taxed later, you benefit from compounding without the immediate tax burden.
   - *Stable Income Assets in Taxable Accounts*: Consider holding more stable income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to manage taxes better, as interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

By carefully balancing these elements, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency over time.
