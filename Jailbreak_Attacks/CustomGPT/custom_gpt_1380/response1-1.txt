Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement (contributions are made with after-tax dollars).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings are subject to capital gains tax and income tax, depending on the type of investment and the duration held.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months' worth of expenses) in a liquid account.

4. **Time Horizon**: If you are farther from retirement, you might want to invest more aggressively in taxable accounts, where you can take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in all account types to balance risk and potential returns.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given individual circumstances can vary widely, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always adjust your strategy as life changes, and regularly review your investments to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.
