Distributing your money across different accounts like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is effectively free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA. Contributions can reduce your taxable income now, and investments grow tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA).

3. **Diversify Investments**: In each of these accounts, ensure you're diversifying your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: When investing in taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments—like index funds or ETFs—that generate fewer capital gains distributions.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow and change, rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income. If you aim to minimize taxes, consider your current and expected future tax bracket.

7. **Long-term vs Short-term Needs**: If you have short-term financial goals, prioritize money in your taxable accounts since you'll have more flexible access. For long-term needs, continue to max out retirement accounts.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to develop a personalized distribution strategy that aligns with your overall financial plan.
