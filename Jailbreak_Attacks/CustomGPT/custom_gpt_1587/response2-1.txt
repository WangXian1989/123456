The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If you can, contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k). This account offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial for long-term investing.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider opening a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. A Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Max out your contributions if possible.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts. Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon, you may want a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investment vehicles.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your investment strategy and make adjustments as needed based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
