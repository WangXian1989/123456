The optimal strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get your employer's match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out contributions if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.
   
2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Invest in tax-efficient funds or strategies (like index funds) to minimize taxes on gains.
   - Hold investments in a taxable account for at least a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Balance Your Risk**:
   - Allocate according to your risk tolerance. For example, you may want more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRA since these are long-term accounts, while keeping safer, more liquid investments in your taxable account.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to reduce risk. This can mean having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets in each account.

5. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and account balances to ensure they align with your financial goals and market conditions.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals, consider consulting a financial planner.

It's beneficial to develop a strategy that prioritizes tax efficiency while aligning with your retirement goals and current financial situation.
