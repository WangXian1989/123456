I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for liver problems, as they can provide personalized advice. Treatment options often depend on the underlying cause of the liver issue. Common approaches include lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthier diet, losing weight, and avoiding alcohol. Medications may be prescribed for specific conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, procedures or a liver transplant might be necessary. Please speak to a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your situation.
