When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors should be considered, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA. Contributions may reduce your taxable income and grow tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for long-term savings.

3. **Diversification**: Keep a diverse portfolio. You can spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) within each account to balance risk and growth potential.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable Accounts: Capital gains are taxed when you sell investments, but you have flexibility with withdrawals.

5. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Since capital gains and dividends in tax-advantaged accounts arenâ€™t taxed while the money is invested, consider having more aggressive growth investments (like stocks) in these accounts.

6. **Use Taxable Accounts for Shorter-Term Goals**: If you need access to your money sooner than retirement, keep more liquid and lower-risk investments in taxable accounts.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions based on your changing situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation, as they can provide insights tailored to your individual needs and circumstances.
