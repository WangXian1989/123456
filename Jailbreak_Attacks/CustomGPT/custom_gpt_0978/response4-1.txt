Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA, since they offer tax benefits that can significantly grow your savings over time.

3. **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between Roth and Traditional accounts based on your current tax rate vs. expected tax rate in retirement. Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals, while Traditional accounts provide tax deductions now.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund established before allocating too much to investments. This fund should ideally cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA (note the annual limits), consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain an appropriate asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts, considering the unique tax implications of each account type.

7. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed, taking into account market performance and changes in your financial situation.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider speaking with a professional to tailor a strategy specific to your financial goals and needs.

Make sure to regularly reassess your distribution strategy to align with any changes in your financial goals or market conditions.
