Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):**
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially "free money."

### 2. **Contribute to Your IRA:**
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The choice depends on your income, tax bracket, and whether you want tax benefits now (Traditional) or later (Roth).

### 3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions:**
   - If you can, contribute up to the IRS limit in your 401(k) after funding your IRA. The tax advantages of a 401(k) can be significant, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you hit the contribution limits on your tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is useful for funds you might need in the short to medium term. 

### 5. **Investment Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 6. **Tax Considerations:**
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes in taxable accounts and consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.

### 7. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically review your asset allocation based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

### Final Thoughts:
Each person's situation is unique, so consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
