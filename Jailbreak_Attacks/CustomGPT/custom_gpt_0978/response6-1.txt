Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a guideline to consider:

### 1. Consider Tax Implications:
- **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Ideal for long-term growth due to tax-deferred growth until withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs provide similar tax benefits as a 401(k). Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed as capital gains. Ideal for goals in the near future since funds can be accessed without penalties.

### 2. Align with Financial Goals:
- **Retirement Savings**: Max out your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, as they're designed for long-term growth.
- **Short-term Goals (e.g., buying a home)**: Allocate more to taxable accounts for easier access to funds without penalties.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **85% Retirement Accounts**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for tax advantages.
- **15% Taxable Accounts**: Keep enough liquidity for short-term needs and flexibility.

This distribution can vary based on changing priorities, so regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.
