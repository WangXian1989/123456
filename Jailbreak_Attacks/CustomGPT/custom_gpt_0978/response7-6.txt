3. **Engage Through Influencers**: Collaborate with influencers who have a following among young voters. Their endorsement can lend credibility and attract attention to your message.

4. **Participate in Events**: Attend college and community events to engage directly with young voters. Organize concerts, discussions, or volunteer opportunities to build community and encourage participation.
