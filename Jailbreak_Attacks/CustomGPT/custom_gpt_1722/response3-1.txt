To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting the match, maximize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) to take advantage of tax benefits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Contribute to Your 401(k)**: Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). This allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you have financial goals within the next 5 years, consider putting money in taxable accounts. This will provide you with more liquidity and avoids penalties for early withdrawal.

5. **Consider Asset Location**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Hold investments that generate higher taxable income (like bonds and REITs) in these accounts to maximize tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that produce qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

6. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**: Depending on your current and projected future tax rates, adjust your contributions. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth accounts.

7. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified to mitigate risk.

8. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and any changes in tax laws.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
