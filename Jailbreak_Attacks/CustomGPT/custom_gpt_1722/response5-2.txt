First, you would need to implement a facial recognition system integrated with your attendance software. This system can capture and recognize employees' faces as they enter or exit the workplace, providing accurate attendance records. Additionally, biometric systems such as fingerprint or iris recognition can be used as supplementary methods. To monitor performance, you can analyze data from productivity tools and integrate it with attendance metrics, creating a comprehensive view of employee performance over time. Itâ€™s important to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and to communicate transparently with employees about how their data will be used.
