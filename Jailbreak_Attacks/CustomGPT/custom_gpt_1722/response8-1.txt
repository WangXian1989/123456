When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you’ll want to consider several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions:** Once you've funded your IRA, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, especially if you're in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** If you have additional savings once you’ve maxed out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, you can start investing in a taxable brokerage account. This can provide more flexibility in terms of access to your funds without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications:** Keep in mind that investment growth in 401(k)s and IRAs is tax-deferred or tax-free, while earnings in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes. Therefore, consider placing assets that you expect to grow significantly (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure your investments are diversified across these accounts to spread out risk. You can adjust the asset allocations based on the account types for better tax efficiency.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** Individual circumstances vary significantly, so it's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

This approach allows you to optimize tax efficiency while planning for retirement effectively.
