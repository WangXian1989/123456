Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can grow tax-deferred, which can significantly compound your earnings over time.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - For 2023, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - The IRA contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you're over 50).
   Ensure you're aware of and adhering to these limits.

4. **Diversification:** Within each account, consider a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investments. Consider investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs, which generally have lower turnover and, therefore, lower capital gains distributions.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Before you start withdrawing, think about which account you will draw from first in retirement—this can affect your tax rate significantly.

7. **Review Regularly:** Regularly assess your asset allocation and investment performance. Adjust as necessary based on changing goals or market conditions.

It’s often advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your individual situation.
