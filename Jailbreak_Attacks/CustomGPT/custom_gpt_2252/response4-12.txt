Iâ€™m not a doctor, but it's essential to consult a healthcare professional to discuss any liver problems you may be experiencing. They can provide you with a thorough evaluation and recommend the best treatment options for your specific situation. Common treatment options might include lifestyle changes (such as diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, medical procedures or surgery, depending on the severity and type of liver condition. Always prioritize professional medical advice for health concerns.
