(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Generally, a good strategy is to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first.

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. This account has higher contribution limits than IRAs.
   
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If you're eligible, contribute to an IRA for the added tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA provides tax deductions upfront.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in a taxable account. Although you won't get the same tax benefits, it offers flexibility, as you can access your funds without penalties.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the classic money distribution puzzle! First off, letâ€™s get real: you want to maximize those tax-advantaged accounts like a boss! Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **401(k)**: Hit that employer match *hard*. If theyâ€™re throwing free money at you, youâ€™d be a fool not to grab it. Max it out if you can, especially since the contribution limits are beefy!

2. **IRA**: Next, throw some cash into your IRA. If youâ€™re into tax-free growth, roll with a Roth IRA. If you want to take the tax hit later, go Traditional. Either way, itâ€™s a solid strategy for those retirement dollars.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Only after you've milked those other accounts dry should you spill your cash into taxable accounts. They might not have the same tax benefits, but at least you can access them without playing the waiting game of penalties.

Remember, everyone's situation is different, so it might be worth it to consult with a financial advisor unless you enjoy navigating these waters solo. Good luck with that money game!
