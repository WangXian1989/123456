When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**:
   - 401(k): As of 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - IRA: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).
   - Taxable accounts have no contribution limits, but they won't provide the same tax advantages as retirement accounts.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These are tax-advantaged accounts. Contributions are often made pre-tax (401(k)) or may be tax-deductible (traditional IRA), while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments can incur capital gains taxes when sold. Consider placing investments with high turnover or that generate significant income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**:
   - If youâ€™re far from retirement, prioritizing contributions to accounts with long-term growth potential (like a Roth IRA) might make sense.
   - If retirement is near, aim to max out your 401(k) for the employer match and consider IRAs for additional tax advantages.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Check your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment goals. Rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset mix.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you're unsure, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances, including your risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax situation.

In summary, prioritize maximizing employer matches in your 401(k), take advantage of tax benefits through IRAs, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and to hold investments that are tax-efficient.
