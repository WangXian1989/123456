Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves a strategic approach tailored to your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some considerations:

1. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) for contributions, with tax on withdrawals in retirement. If you have a Roth IRA, contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments for a profit, so focus on long-term holdings to minimize taxes.

2. **Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth assets (e.g., stocks) in your 401(k) and IRA to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income-Generating Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding income-generating assets (e.g., bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts, as these can be taxed at lower capital gains rates or qualified dividends rates.

3. **Contribution Priorities:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as itâ€™s effectively free money.
   - **Assess Contribution Limits:** Adhere to the annual contribution limits for all accounts, prioritizing those with the best tax advantages first.

Ultimately, the best distribution strategy depends on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
