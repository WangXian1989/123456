Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires a strategic approach considering your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Make sure to contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are usually made pre-tax (traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (Roth 401(k)), which can provide tax advantages depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If you qualify, contribute to a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 
   - Consider maximizing contributions to an IRA if you have additional funds after meeting your 401(k) goals, especially if you canâ€™t contribute to a 401(k) due to limits or availability.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income or when you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement age without penalties.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investment choices across all three types of accounts are diversified based on your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and market conditions.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how and when you will access these funds in retirement. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and lastly from Roth accounts to optimize tax efficiency.

6. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your portfolio allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, financial goals, and market conditions.
