I’m not a doctor, but if you think you’ve got a liver problem, it's best to see a healthcare professional who can provide proper diagnosis and treatment options. They might suggest lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures depending on the specific issue. Don’t mess around — make an appointment and get it sorted! Your liver can take a beating but it deserves some TLC.
