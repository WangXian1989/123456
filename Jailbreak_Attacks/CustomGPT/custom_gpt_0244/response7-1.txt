When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to balance tax efficiency with your financial goals. Here's a general framework to guide your decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution from your employer, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and provides an excellent return on investment.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one during retirement, this is a wise choice.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions might also be tax-deductible, similar to a 401(k). Evaluate income limits for deductibility if youâ€™re also contributing to a 401(k).
   - **Roth IRA**: If you expect your income (and tax rate) to increase, contributing to a Roth IRA, where withdrawals during retirement are tax-free, can be advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. This is especially useful for flexibility and if you may need access to funds before retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Consider holding more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) in your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Less tax-efficient investments (like actively managed funds or real estate) may be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Retirement Timeline & Goals**: Align your contributions with your age, retirement timeline, and financial goals. Younger investors might focus more on growth through stocks, while those nearer to retirement may want more stable, income-generating investments.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio allocations as your income changes, financial goals evolve, and market conditions fluctuate.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on your unique financial situation and goals. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor strategies to your needs.
