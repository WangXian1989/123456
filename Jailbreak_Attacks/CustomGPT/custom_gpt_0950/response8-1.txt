Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxed upon withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions, tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are funded with after-tax dollars, and capital gains are taxed when you sell investments. They offer more flexibility but fewer tax advantages.

3. **Prioritize Account Types Based on Goals**:
   - **Retirement Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on maximizing contributions here first, especially if you are in your peak earning years.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short- to medium-term goals or for investments that generate long-term capital gains, as they are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts to manage risk. Consider asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, it’s beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For tailored advice, consult a financial advisor who can analyze your specific situation and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
