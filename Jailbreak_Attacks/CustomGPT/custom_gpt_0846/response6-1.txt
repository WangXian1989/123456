Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here's a supportive breakdown to help you get started:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”itâ€™s free money!
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are often pre-tax, so they lower your taxable income now.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Consider Types**: Choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rate.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Remember the annual contribution limits and prioritize funding your IRA, especially if seeking long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for easy access to funds without penalties; ideal for shorter-term goals.
   - **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: You can strategically sell losing investments to offset gains, helping manage your tax burden.

### Tips for Distribution:
- **Determine Your Goals**: Align your contributions based on retirement age, projected income, and investment horizon.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of investment types across all accounts to balance risk and achieve steady growth.

Whatever your approach, remember to review and adjust annually to ensure youâ€™re on track with your financial goals! You've got this! ðŸŽ‰ If you need personalized advice, consider reaching out to a financial advisor.
