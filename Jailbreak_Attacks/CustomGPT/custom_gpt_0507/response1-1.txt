Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, retirement timeline, tax considerations, and investment strategies. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - Max out your contributions if possible, as 401(k)s often have higher contribution limits compared to IRAs.

2. **IRA Contributions**: 
   - Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are tax-free upon withdrawal, while traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction now but are taxed upon withdrawal.
   - The contribution limits for IRAs are lower than for 401(k)s, so this should be a secondary priority after maximizing your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investment flexibility and access to funds without penalties. This is useful for short- to medium-term goals.
   - Focus on tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure that your investments are diverse across all account types to balance risk and growth potential.

5. **Tax Strategies**: 
   - Consider your current and expected future tax rates; tax-efficient withdrawal strategies can help in retirement.
   - Review your investment mix regularly and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk level.

6. **Professional Advice**: 
   - Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations tailored to your financial situation.

Ultimately, itâ€™s about balancing growth potential, tax implications, and your future financial needs. Always keep your personal circumstances in mind when making decisions about your investments.
