The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some key considerations:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider funding your IRA (Roth or Traditional) up to the annual contribution limit. These accounts offer tax benefits that can boost your long-term savings.

2. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes, whereas contributions to 401(k) and IRA accounts can be tax-deductible (for Traditional accounts). If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to tax-deferred accounts.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of account type. This can help manage risk and volatility.

4. **Consider Liquidity Needs**: Money in taxable accounts can be accessed more easily than in retirement accounts, so keep some liquid investments there if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your portfolio and rebalance as necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

Ultimately, it's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your individual circumstances.
