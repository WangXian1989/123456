The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts will depend on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Consider maxing out contributions to your 401(k) if you're in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer the same tax benefits as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you might prioritize one over the other.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts do not offer tax-deferred growth, but you have more access to your money without penalties. Utilize this for goals that are shorter-term or for funds you may need before retirement.

3. **Investment Growth Potential**: Consider the growth potential of investments in each account. Typically, you might want to place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks) and lower-growth or income-generating investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts, due to the tax implications on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is well-diversified. Distributing your investments across different asset classes in each type of account can help you manage risk.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan for how and when you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Different accounts have different rules about withdrawals and tax implications, so consider how this fits into your long-term financial plan.

6. **Regulatory Limits**: Be aware of contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, for instance, the 401(k) contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older), and the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older).

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Once youâ€™ve established your allocation, be sure to monitor and rebalance your portfolio regularly to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Ultimately, the best strategy will be personalized to your financial situation, so it might also be helpful to consult with a financial advisor.
