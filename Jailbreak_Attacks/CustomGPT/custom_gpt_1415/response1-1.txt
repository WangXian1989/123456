The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. However, here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (post-tax), your tax situation will differ. Consider your current tax bracket and where you expect to be in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t have tax advantages, but they offer flexibility and access to funds without penalties before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains tax on investments.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across these accounts are diversified. This might mean holding different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in each account, which can help mitigate risk.

4. **Investment Goals**: If you're saving for short-term goals, keep funds in a taxable account where you can access them without restrictions. For long-term retirement, prioritize your 401(k) and IRA contributions.

5. **Consider Your Age and Retirement Timeline**: Younger individuals may benefit from maxing out their 401(k) and IRA contributions, while those closer to retirement might prioritize income-generating assets in taxable accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Your life circumstances and financial markets change, so regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed.

It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized plan that fits your specific situation.
