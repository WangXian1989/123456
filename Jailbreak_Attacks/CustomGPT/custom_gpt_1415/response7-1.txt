It's great that you're thinking about how to effectively distribute your money among various investment accounts! The best approach often depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax considerations. Here are some general principles to consider:

1. **Understand Each Account Type**:
   - **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Prioritize contributions to receive any match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Similar to a 401(k) in terms of tax advantages, but with different contribution limits and eligibility based on income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments you may want to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

2. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - Maximize your 401(k) contributions to at least the company match.
   - Consider contributing to an IRA (Roth or Traditional) to take advantage of further tax benefits.
   - Invest in a taxable account for flexibility and to hold investments that may yield higher capital gains or dividends, which you may want to keep accessible.

3. **Diversification and Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments between stocks and bonds based on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.
   - Use tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax impacts and take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains.

4. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.
   - As you approach retirement, consider shifting towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that fits your specific financial situation and objectives.

Ultimately, the right approach can vary based on personal circumstances, so it’s good to assess your financial picture regularly.
