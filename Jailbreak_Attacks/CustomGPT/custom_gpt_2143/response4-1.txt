To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money and a good starting point.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA (if eligible) and your 401(k) contributions. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your long-term savings.

3. **Assess Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of each account type. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at a lower rate.

4. **Diverse Investment Strategies**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, the potential for growth might be higher in accounts meant for long-term investments (like your 401(k) and IRA).

5. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Keep investments that generate high dividends or interest in tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts can be used for short-term goals or as an emergency fund since they offer easier withdrawal options.

6. **Reevaluate Regularly**: Periodically review and rebalance your asset distribution as your financial situation, goals, or market conditions change.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If youâ€™re unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your circumstances.

Remember that everyone's financial situation is unique, and tailored strategies often yield the best results.
