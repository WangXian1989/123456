Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach you can consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth). IRAs often provide valuable tax benefits depending on your income and the type of account.

3. **Assess Tax Brackets**: Evaluate your current and expected future tax brackets. If you anticipate being in a higher bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be beneficial. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower bracket, a Traditional IRA could be the better option.

4. **Distribute Remaining Funds**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit. Finally, any additional funds can be directed to taxable accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Think about how you invest your funds in each account type. Taxable accounts can be more suited for investments that generate capital gains, while tax-advantaged accounts are ideal for long-term growth.

6. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
