To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to maximize your annual contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

2. **Strategic Asset Allocation:**
   - **Growth Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA and 401(k)).
   - **Income-Producing Investments in Taxable Accounts:** Keep more income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts, where you can manage the taxable distributions more effectively.

Implement these strategies based on your specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline to optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
