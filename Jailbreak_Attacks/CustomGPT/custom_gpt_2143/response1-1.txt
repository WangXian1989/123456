The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), try to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Taxes are paid when you withdraw the funds in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax benefits as a 401(k) if you qualify; however, there may be income limits for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, including earnings. This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   
3. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all three accounts to balance risk and return.

4. **Withdrawals**: If you anticipate needing access to funds before retirement, focus more on taxable accounts or Roth IRAs, as these may offer more flexibility without penalties.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing investments in the most tax-efficient accounts. For instance, high-growth investments (like stocks) might be better in Roth IRAs, while bond funds (which generate taxable interest) may be more suitable for tax-deferred accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Regularly assess your allocations to ensure they align with your goals and risk tolerance.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
