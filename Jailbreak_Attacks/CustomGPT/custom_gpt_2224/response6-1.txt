To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand the Tax Implications:
- **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income for the year. Growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. Roth IRA contributions are made post-tax, allowing tax-free withdrawals if conditions are met.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investment earnings (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxed in the year they are realized. Favor long-term investments to minimize capital gains.

### 2. Determine Your Financial Goals:
- **Retirement**: Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., max contributions to your 401(k) and IRA).
- **Short-term Goals**: Allocate funds to a taxable account for easier access and liquidity.

### 3. Diversification and Asset Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Invest in a diversified mix of funds available in your plan, aligning with your risk tolerance.
- **IRA**: Consider a broader range of investments, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs, to optimize growth.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Select tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, municipal bonds) to mitigate tax impact.

### 4. Regular Review and Adjustments:
- Periodically review your allocations and adjust based on market conditions, performance, and changes in your financial situation.

### Conclusion:
Balancing your investments across these accounts can optimize tax efficiency and align with your financial goals. It's beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances.
