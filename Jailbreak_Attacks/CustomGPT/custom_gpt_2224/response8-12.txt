I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional for the best advice on liver treatment options. Generally, treatment can vary widely depending on the specific liver condition. Options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery. A healthcare provider can offer personalized guidance based on your situation. Please make sure to seek medical advice!
