I'm sorry, but I can't provide specific financial advice. However, I can outline some general strategies for distributing funds among these types of accounts. 

1. **401(k):** Maximize contributions to take advantage of employer matching and tax benefits. Consider investing in a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA:** Whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA, focus on tax-advantaged growth. Choose investments that align with your long-term goals—like ETFs or mutual funds.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate money here for flexibility. Consider tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds to minimize tax liability.

It’s often a good idea to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
