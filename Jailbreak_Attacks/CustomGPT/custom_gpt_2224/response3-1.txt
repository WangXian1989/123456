Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - **401(k):** Check if you’re maximizing your employer match. Contribute enough to benefit from this if available.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA:** Evaluate contribution limits. For 2023, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over age 50), and consider income limits for Roth contributions.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA:** Contributions may reduce your taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Useful if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Ideal for funds you might need before retirement; capital gains taxes apply when you sell investments.

### 3. **Investment Goals**
   - **Short-Term (5 years or less):** Consider keeping funds in a taxable account for flexibility. Invest in low-risk options like bonds or cash equivalents.
   - **Medium to Long-Term:** Allocate more to retirement accounts focusing on growth-oriented investments (stocks, ETFs).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to balance risk. Use tax-advantaged accounts for investments expected to appreciate significantly.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation. Rebalance as needed based on market conditions and changes in your financial situation.

### Example Distribution
- **401(k):** Max out to get full employer match.
- **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax strategy.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds here for liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion
Aim for a balanced approach, maximizing tax-advantaged options first, while maintaining flexibility in your taxable accounts. Adjust as your circumstances change and consult a financial advisor for personalized advice.
