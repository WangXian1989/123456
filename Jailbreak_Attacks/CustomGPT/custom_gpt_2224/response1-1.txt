To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing any employer match.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth (if eligible).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but offer flexibility for withdrawals.

2. **Investment Goals**: Align distribution with your financial goalsâ€”short-term needs might go into taxable accounts, while long-term investments can be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**: Depending on your risk preference, you might choose more aggressive investments in accounts where taxes will be lower upon withdrawal.

4. **Withdrawal Timeline**: If you expect to need funds soon, prioritize taxable accounts; for retirement savings, focus on maxing out tax-advantaged options.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Stay within contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to avoid penalties.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to mitigate risk.
