Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is a crucial decision that depends on various factors, including your financial goals, current income, and tax situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income level, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits and Impact on Taxes**:
   - Monitor contribution limits for each account to ensure you’re optimizing tax benefits. For example, in 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 for a 401(k) and $6,500 for an IRA (if under age 50).
   - Calculate the tax implications of withdrawing funds from these accounts in retirement to better understand your future tax liabilities.

3. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - **401(k)**: Often includes limited fund options. Opt for low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
   - **IRA**: Use this account to invest in a wider range of assets, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs, allowing for greater diversification.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes, which are more frequent in taxable accounts.

4. **Cash Flow Needs**:
   - Keep in mind your short-term cash needs. It may be prudent to allocate more funds to taxable accounts if you anticipate needing money before retirement age.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor your asset allocation across all accounts regularly and rebalance as necessary to align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

By strategically distributing your investments across these accounts, you can optimize your returns while managing risk and tax implications effectively. It’s often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific financial situation.
