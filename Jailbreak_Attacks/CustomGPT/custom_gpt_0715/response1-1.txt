When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it really depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax implications. Here's a general guideline to help you out:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) has an employer match, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars but allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are great for flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell. Consider holding investments long-term in these accounts to minimize taxes.

3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: The type of account can also dictate your investment strategy. For short-term goals, keep more funds in your taxable account for easy access. For long-term goals (like retirement), maximize retirement accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure youâ€™re diversifying your investments to hedge against risks. Spread your contributions across different asset classes and investment types.

5. **Regular Review**: Investment needs change over time, so it's essential to regularly review your allocations and adjust based on performance, changing financial goals, or life changes.

Ultimately, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and financial goals.
