(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, age, tax situation, and retirement plans. Generally, here are a few strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this benefit. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**: Consider your current and expected future tax rates. Contributions to a traditional 401(k) and IRA are tax-deferred, while Roth accounts allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you believe your tax rate will be lower in retirement, favor tax-deferred accounts. Conversely, if you expect a higher tax rate, consider Roth options.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that you maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Different asset allocations may be appropriate for each account type depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Taxable accounts provide flexibility, while tax-advantaged accounts may carry penalties for early withdrawals.

It is often beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy that aligns with your long-term financial objectives.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Now, donâ€™t forget your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re your wild cards! While they get taxed, they also give you the flexibility to access your dough without penalties before retirement age. Keep some cash and flexible investments there for emergencies or spontaneous vacations. 

4. **Mix it Up**: Lastly (and I canâ€™t stress this enough), diversify! Donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket, or youâ€™ll be scrambling when the market dips. A mix of stocks, bonds, and maybe a little crypto for fun can keep your portfolio rolling.
