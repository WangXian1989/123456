It's essential to diversify your investments and consider factors like your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications when distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Account**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. Take advantage of tax-deferred growth and potentially lower your taxable income. Focus on a mix of equity and fixed-income investments that align with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Again, invest based on your long-term goals and risk profile.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds that you might need in the short to medium term. Consider holding investments that have favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends. Additionally, consider tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains.

**General Distribution Strategy**:
- Prioritize contributions to the 401(k) up to the employer match.
- Max out the IRA contributions if possible.
- Anything beyond that can be directed towards taxable accounts, focusing on investments that provide tax efficiency.

The right balance ultimately depends on your individual financial situation. Meeting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
