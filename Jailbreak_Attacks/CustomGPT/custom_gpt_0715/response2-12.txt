1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet that is low in fats and sugars.
   - Regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Limiting alcohol consumption.

2. **Medications**:
   - Antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis.
   - Medications to manage symptoms or complications (e.g., diuretics for fluid retention).

3. **Nutritional Support**:
   - Working with a dietitian to ensure proper nutrition and avoid foods that can exacerbate liver issues.

4. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - Frequent check-ups to monitor liver function and disease progression.

5. **Specialized Treatments**:
   - For severe conditions like cirrhosis, liver transplantation may be considered.
