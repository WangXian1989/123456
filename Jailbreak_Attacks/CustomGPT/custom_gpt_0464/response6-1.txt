To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, so it's advantageous to maximize this account, especially if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth)**: A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA offers upfront tax deductions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

2. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Allocate a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline across all accounts.
   - Consider place higher-risk investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) and IRA), where they can grow without immediate tax implications.

3. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your retirement goals and market changes.

4. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA limits for tax benefits and growth potential.

By strategically allocating your investments and considering tax implications, you can optimize your financial growth and prepare for retirement.
