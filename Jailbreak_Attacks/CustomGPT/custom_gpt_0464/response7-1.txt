Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can help your money grow more efficiently. If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts can result in capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. Depending on your current and expected future income, you might want to balance your contributions to favor tax-free growth (like a Roth IRA) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Generally, equities are better suited for long-term growth and should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Fixed-income investments might be more beneficial in taxable accounts due to favorable tax treatment on long-term capital gains.

4. **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and rebalance your investments across accounts. Ensure that your overall asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and future financial needs.

5. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances.

Always remember to review your financial strategy periodically as your situation and market conditions change.
