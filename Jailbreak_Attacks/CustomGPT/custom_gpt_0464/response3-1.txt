Distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. It grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deferral, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: While these do not have tax advantages, they offer flexibility and can hold different types of investments that might generate capital gains or dividends.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure you're diversifying your investments across all accounts. Consider the types of investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) and their risk levels.

4. **Debt Repayment**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before maximizing retirement accounts.

5. **Long-term vs. Short-term Needs**: Allocate more to tax-advantaged accounts for your long-term goals and consider taxable accounts for more immediate needs, as they offer more flexibility.

6. **Rebalancing Your Portfolio**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
