I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver), medications may be prescribed to reduce inflammation or manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and imaging can help assess liver function and detect any progression of disease.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Treatments**: Some people explore herbal supplements, but always consult a doctor first.

It's essential to discuss your specific condition with a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.
