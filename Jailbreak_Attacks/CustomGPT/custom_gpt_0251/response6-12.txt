I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, itâ€™s essential to consult with a healthcare professional. Common treatment options might include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Diet modifications (low-fat, balanced meals).
   - Regular exercise.

2. **Medications:**
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Medications for underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, high cholesterol).

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests.

4. **Surgery:**
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

Always seek personalized advice from a healthcare provider.
