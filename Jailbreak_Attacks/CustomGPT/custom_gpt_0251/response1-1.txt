Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing your retirement accounts, utilize taxable accounts for investment flexibility. This is especially useful for short-term goals or if you want access to funds before retirement age.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts according to your risk tolerance and goals. Generally, higher-risk investments can go in the accounts with tax advantages due to longer growth potential.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and adjust your distribution based on market performance, changes in income, or financial goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this plan to your specific needs.
