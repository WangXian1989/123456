To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Define your retirement goals, investment timeline, and risk tolerance.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Max out your IRA contributions if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth.

4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance. Use tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review and adjust your portfolio annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - For retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRA) to optimize tax efficiency.

7. **Stay Informed**:
   - Keep updated on changes in tax laws and investment options that can impact your strategy.

This balanced approach can help you optimize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
