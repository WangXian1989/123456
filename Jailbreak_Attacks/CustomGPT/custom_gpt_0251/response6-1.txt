To optimize your investment strategy across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **401(k) & IRA**: Prioritize contributions here for tax advantages. Use these for higher-growth investments, as taxes are deferred.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Place low-turnover investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds.

### 2. Contribution Strategies
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match first.
- **Roth IRA Options**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth on contributions and withdrawals.

### 3. Diversification and Risk Management
- **Asset Allocation**: Balance risk across accounts; keep more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your portfolio to maintain desired risk levels across all accounts.

### Summary
- Maximize 401(k) contributions to employer limits.
- Utilize IRAs for tax benefits.
- Keep taxable accounts for liquidity and tax efficiency.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money to minimize taxes and maximize growth.
