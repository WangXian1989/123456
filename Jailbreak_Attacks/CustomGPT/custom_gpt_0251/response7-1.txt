To effectively distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - Maximize employer matches first. Contribute enough to get the full match, as it's essentially "free money."
   - Choose low-cost index funds or diversified mutual funds to minimize fees.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Use a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket upon retirement.
   - Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Focus on investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - Use this account for short-term savings or investments you might need access to before retirement age.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing goals.
- **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of selling investments in taxable accounts.
- **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment strategy with your retirement timeline and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
