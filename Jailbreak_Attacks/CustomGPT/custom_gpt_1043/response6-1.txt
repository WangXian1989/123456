To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Tax Implications:
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing taxable income. Focus on maximizing employer matches for immediate benefits.
   - **IRA:** Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), contributions can be tax-deductible or tax-free upon withdrawal, respectively.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Interest and dividends are taxed yearly, while capital gains are taxed upon sale. Use this account for investments needing liquidity.

### 2. Allocate Based on Goals and Timelines:
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for retirement savings. Aim for max contributions.
   - **Short-Term Goals:** Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement, keeping investments liquid.

### 3. Risk and Investment Strategy:
   - **401(k):** Choose a mix of equities and bonds based on your risk tolerance and age.
   - **IRA:** Consider a more aggressive portfolio if retirement is far off, as time could mitigate volatility.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Invest in low-turnover and tax-efficient funds (e.g., index funds) to minimize tax liabilities.

### Summary:
- Maximize 401(k) first for employer matching.
- Balance contributions to IRA focusing on deduction or growth strategies.
- Use taxable accounts for flexibility and tax-efficient investments.

By strategically distributing your investments this way, you can optimize growth and manage tax liabilities effectively.
