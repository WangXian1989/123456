I'm not a doctor, but I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for the best treatment options for liver problems. Common approaches may include lifestyle changes, medications, and sometimes surgery, depending on the specific condition. Key aspects to consider are:

1. **Dietary Changes**: A healthy diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables.
2. **Regular Exercise**: Engaging in physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake can prevent further damage.
4. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications might be necessary to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
5. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and tests to monitor liver function.

Always seek medical advice for personalized treatment options.
