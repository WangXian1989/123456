The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are particularly advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might need to be accessed before retirement or for goals outside of retirement, such as buying a home. Taxable accounts also provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Hold tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversified Investments**: Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) regardless of the account type.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're uncertain, a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.

Balancing these accounts effectively can enhance your long-term financial security.
