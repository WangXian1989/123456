Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires careful consideration of your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

### 1. **Assess Your Goals**
   - **Retirement Goals**: Consider when you plan to retire and how much you'll need.
   - **Short-term vs. Long-term Needs**: Identify funds needed for immediate expenses versus long-term growth.

### 2. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often offers employer matching contributions, pre-tax or Roth contributions. Suitable for long-term retirement savings due to tax advantages.
   - **IRA**: Similar tax benefits to a 401(k), but with lower contribution limits. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, but subject to capital gains tax. Good for short- to medium-term goals.

### 3. **Determine Contribution Priorities**
   - Max out employer match in your 401(k) if available.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA contribution for additional tax benefits.
   - Fund your taxable accounts for investment flexibility or short-term goals.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Diversify your investments across accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - Consider holding more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.

### 5. **Review and Adjust**
   - Periodically reassess your distribution strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Professional advice can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique financial situation.

By balancing contributions and maintaining an appropriate investment strategy across all accounts, you can effectively plan for growth while managing tax implications.
