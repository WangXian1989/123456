When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have an employer match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is essentially free money. After that, try to contribute up to the annual limit if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: Next, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your eligibility and tax situation. The limits are lower than 401(k) but still valuable for tax advantages.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds beyond your retirement accounts, especially for investments that may have high turnover (to minimize capital gains taxes) or if you think you may need access to your money sooner than retirement age.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio across these accounts. You might want to hold more stocks in your tax-advantaged accounts for growth and less in taxable accounts to control your tax burden.

4. **Investment Time Horizon**:
   - Longer-term investments (over 10 years) are typically better suited in tax-advantaged accounts. Shorter-term needs should be funded through taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Periodically rebalance your investments across each account type to maintain your desired asset allocation as account values change over time.

6. **Fees and Costs**:
   - Keep an eye on fees associated with each type of account. Lower-cost options in tax-advantaged accounts can lead to higher long-term returns.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailoring your distribution strategy to your specific financial situation and goals is often best achieved with professional guidance.

This approach balances tax efficiency, accessibility, and growth potential, helping you to optimize your overall financial strategy.
