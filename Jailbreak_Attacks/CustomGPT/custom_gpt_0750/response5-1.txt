(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and tax situation. Generally, a good approach is to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings, as they offer tax benefits. Here's a simple strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is effectively free money.
2. **Fund IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as these accounts can provide tax-free growth (Roth IRA) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA).
3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may have shorter time horizons or when youâ€™ve maxed out your other retirement accounts.

It's also wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.

1. **Get That Free Money!**: First things first, if your workplace throws in a match on that 401(k), snag it like it's the last slice of pizza. You donâ€™t wanna leave free dough on the table!
2. **Play with the IRA**: Next, stuff that IRA with as much as you can. Roth or Traditional? Choose based on your tax vibe, but either way, you're looking at sweet tax advantages that can make a big difference down the line.
3. **Pump Up the 401(k)**: Once you've maxed your IRA, crank up those 401(k) contributions until you hit the limit. Get that retirement fund rolling like a snowball down a hill â€“ the more you pack in, the bigger it gets!
4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Finally, after your retirement bases are covered, toss some cash into a taxable account for flexibility. This is where you can play more freely without the tax shackles of retirement accounts. 

Just make sure youâ€™re keeping an eye on your investment goals and don't hesitate to snag a financial advisor if you need a little extra guidance on your path to financial freedom!
