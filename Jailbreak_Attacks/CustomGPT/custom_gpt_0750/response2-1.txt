When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match; it's free money! Generally, aim to contribute the maximum allowed if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments held here can lead to capital gains taxes on profitable trades, so they are often best for investments you plan to hold long-term.

3. **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have an emergency fund outside of these accounts. This can help avoid withdrawing from your retirement accounts prematurely, which can lead to penalties.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**:
   - Allocate money based on your investment timeline and goals. Funds for short-term goals should stay in more accessible, low-risk accounts (like a taxable account), while funds for retirement can be more aggressive in growth-oriented investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize returns and manage risk, keeping in mind the tax implications of each account.

6. **Continuous Review**: Regularly review your portfolio and adjust as needed based on market conditions, life changes, or altered goals.

7. **Consult a Professional**: If unsure, consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation.

Balancing your contributions across these accounts while considering tax efficiency and your own financial goals is key to a healthy long-term investment strategy.
