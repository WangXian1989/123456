The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize any employer match first, since this is essentially "free money".
   - If you can contribute more, aim to maximize contributions up to the annual limit (e.g., $20,500 in 2022, with a catch-up contribution of $6,500 if you're over 50) if it suits your cash flow.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The limit for IRAs also has annual caps ($6,000 in 2022, $7,000 if over 50).
   - A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for savings beyond retirement account limits. They offer more flexibility if you might need to access funds before retirement age without penalties.
   - This is also a good place for investments that may not generate much short-term taxable income, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider what types of investments you hold in each account type. Growth investments (stocks) may fare better in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) because you defer taxes. Conversely, it's often better to hold income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the current and future tax implications of each account type. Keep in mind the required minimum distributions (RMDs) for 401(k)s and traditional IRAs after age 72.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changing financial goals, life situations, and market conditions.

It is always advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.
