I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare professional for liver problems. Generally, treatment options may vary based on the specific liver issue, but could include lifestyle changes (like diet and alcohol reduction), medication, or even procedures for more serious conditions. Always best to get personalized advice from a medical expert!
