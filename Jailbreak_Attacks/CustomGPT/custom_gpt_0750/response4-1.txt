To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if it is offered. This is essentially free money that can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **401(k) Contribution**: If you're not maxing out your 401(k) contributions yet, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of any match, then gradually increase your contributions.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Once you've maximized your 401(k) match, contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). This can be a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your tax situation and retirement goals. Tax advantages vary, so choose based on your current and expected future tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After you've made contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), use any additional savings to invest in taxable brokerage accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Diversification Across Account Types**: Keep in mind the types of investments you hold in each account. For instance, it may be beneficial to hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolios across the different account types to ensure they align with your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.

7. **Consider Withdrawal Needs**: Plan withdrawals from these accounts in retirement based on tax implications to minimize your overall tax burden.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
