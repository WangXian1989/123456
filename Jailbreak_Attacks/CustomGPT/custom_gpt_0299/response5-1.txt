Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Since contributions reduce your taxable income, focus on maximizing contributions (up to the limit).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, a Traditional IRA may be beneficial. If you anticipate a higher tax rate, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute the annual limit, as these accounts also offer tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use these for shorter-term goals or if you need access to funds before retirement age without penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments with lower capital gains distributions, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Asset Allocation**: Consider placing investments that generate higher taxes (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts, and more tax-efficient investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your asset allocation as your financial situation or the market changes.
