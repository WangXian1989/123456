Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several strategic considerations:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-deferred growth, often with employer matching. Best for higher contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account option (Traditional vs. Roth). Tax benefits vary.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexible withdrawals, but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 3. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider maxing out your IRA contribution, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments with high growth potential that you can hold long-term to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - Keep bond investments in tax-deferred accounts to avoid high taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Assess Your Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals to guide allocations in each account type.
   - Longer time horizons can handle more risk.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation based on market performance and your evolving goals.

### Example Distribution:
1. **401(k)**: Max contributions (to match).
2. **IRA**: Max contributions (Roth if eligible).
3. **Taxable Account**: Additional savings for short to medium-term goals or emergency fund.

### Conclusion:
A balanced approach that emphasizes tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining flexibility with taxable investments typically yields the best long-term results. Adjust based on personal circumstances and financial goals. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
