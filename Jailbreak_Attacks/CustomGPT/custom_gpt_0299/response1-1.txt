Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Prioritize contributions to these accounts due to tax benefits. If you can, max out your IRA contributions (especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA for future tax-free withdrawals).
   
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations as your financial situation and market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial professional who can analyze your specific situation.

### Quick Tip:
Consider tax implications when withdrawing from these accounts. Taxable accounts might offer more flexibility in optimal tax strategies.
