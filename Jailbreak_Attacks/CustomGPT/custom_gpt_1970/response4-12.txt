I'm not a doctor, but here are some general treatment options for liver problems. Itâ€™s crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and tailored treatment:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Healthy diet (low in fat, high in fruits and vegetables)
   - Regular exercise
   - Avoiding alcohol

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antiviral drugs for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Milk thistle or other liver-supporting supplements (consult your doctor first)

4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests for liver function
   - Imaging tests to assess liver health

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, liver transplant may be considered.

Always discuss options with your healthcare provider to find the best plan for you.
