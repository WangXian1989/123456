Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some tips to help you strategize effectively:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match—this is free money. Aim to max it out if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions now.

2. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maxing out employer matches in your 401(k), shift focus to funding your IRA.
   - Finally, contribute to your taxable accounts for additional investments.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from this.

4. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re far from retirement, it may make sense to prioritize the accounts with the best tax benefits (401(k) and IRA). 

5. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (stocks), while placing safer investments (bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on interest income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Getting personalized advice can help tailor your strategy to your unique situation.

Overall, a balanced approach focusing on tax efficiency and your retirement timeline can enhance your investment strategy.
