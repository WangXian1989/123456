Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages and helps with long-term growth.

### 3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you expect to need access to funds before retirement age, as they don't have the same withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Consider Investment Strategy**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Focus on growth investments (stocks, mutual funds) since they benefit from tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding tax-efficient investments (index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.

### Summary
Start with employer 401(k) matching, follow up with IRA contributions, and consider taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your investments based on time horizon and tax implications.
