To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Prioritize Investing**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may incur higher taxes, such as bonds or actively managed funds, which are less tax-efficient.

### 3. **Consider Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Investments:** Use tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth assets (e.g., stocks) to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Shorter-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid and stable investments in taxable accounts for easier access.

### 4. **Asset Location Strategy**
   - Place **higher-growth investments** in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use **income-generating investments** (e.g., bonds) in taxable accounts to capitalize on lower capital gains tax rates.

Regularly re-evaluate your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and life goals to ensure optimal growth and tax efficiency.
