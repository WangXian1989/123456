Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax strategy.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that are less tax-efficient (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) to minimize tax impact.
   - Balance between tax-deferred growth in 401(k) and IRA versus the flexibility of taxable accounts.

### 3. **Investment Timeline:**
   - For retirement, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize taxable accounts for liquidity.

### 4. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Review and Adjust:**
   - Monitor your investments and make adjustments based on changes in income, goals, or tax laws.

### Key Takeaway:
Start with employer matches and max out tax-advantaged accounts before contributing to taxable ones. A balanced approach aligned with your specific financial goals is crucial. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
