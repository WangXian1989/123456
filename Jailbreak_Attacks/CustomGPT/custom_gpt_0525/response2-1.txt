Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeframe. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions next, if you qualify. This can provide tax benefits and a wider range of investment options.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and **Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal in retirement. Ideal for those expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. This is ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment gains are subject to capital gains tax, which can be minimized through tax-efficient investing (e.g., holding investments long-term).

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Assign different asset classes to different accounts based on their tax treatment. For example, hold bonds (which generate interest income) in tax-advantaged accounts and equities (with potential for long-term capital gains) in taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Consider Future Needs**:
   - If you need access to funds before retirement, prioritize contributions to your taxable accounts due to their liquidity. 

6. **Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy according to your unique situation.

Overall, the ideal distribution is highly individual. Focusing on maximizing tax advantages while meeting your financial goals is key.
