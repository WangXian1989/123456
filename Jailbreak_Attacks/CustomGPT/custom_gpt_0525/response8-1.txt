To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money".

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts provide tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

   - **401(k)**: Start with contributions up to the match, then consider maxing it out if you can afford it. For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Traditional or Roth IRA**: In 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) in a liquid account.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once your tax-advantaged accounts are maxed out, you can invest in taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains tax, so consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Equities typically go into tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax deferral. Bonds may be more suitable for taxable accounts, especially if held for income.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your asset allocation and redistribute funds to maintain your desired investment strategy.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so consulting a professional can offer tailored strategies.

By following these strategies, you can optimize your investment across these different account types for long-term growth and tax efficiency.
