To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit before allocating money elsewhere.

2. **Contributions Limits**:
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

3. **Investment Growth and Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: This is tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Focus on higher-growth assets here.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Also tax-deferred; consider for high-income years.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth. Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Best for investments you might need to access before retirement. Focus on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diverse investment strategy across all account types to mitigate risk and enhance returns.

5. **Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a longer time until retirement, you may opt for more aggressive investments in the 401(k) and IRAs, while keeping taxable accounts more conservative for liquidity.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your portfolios to align with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific financial goals and situation.
