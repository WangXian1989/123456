Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you're eligible, consider maximizing contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Utilize your 401(k) and Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, particularly if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds or long-term investments) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across different asset classes in each account according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired level of risk.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Prioritize Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: In retirement, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing.

### Summary
- **Maximize 401(k) to Capture Employer Match**: Ensure you're leveraging any company match before moving funds to taxable accounts.
- **Invest in IRAs for Longer-Term Goals**: Prefer tax-advantaged options for retirement savings, but maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for shorter-term needs.

### Final Tips
- Assess your retirement goals and adjust the distribution as necessary.
- Consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach specifically to your circumstances and goals.
