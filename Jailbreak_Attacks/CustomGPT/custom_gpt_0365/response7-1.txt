Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If you qualify, contribute to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may generate significant short-term capital gains or for funds you might need before retirement, since they don’t have withdrawal penalties.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Ensure you have a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, aligning it with your risk tolerance and timeline.

### 5. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for long-term investments.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep more liquid, lower-risk assets in taxable accounts.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - **Rebalance and Adjust:** Periodically review and adjust contributions based on your changing financial situation and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 15% of your income (maximizing any match)
- **IRA:** Contribute up to the max limit
- **Taxable Account:** Any remaining funds or extra savings after maximizing retirement options

This strategy should provide a balanced approach to growth while managing taxes efficiently. Adjust based on personal circumstances and consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
