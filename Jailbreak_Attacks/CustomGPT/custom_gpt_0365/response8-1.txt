Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement timeline, and investment goals. Here are some guidelines:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full matchâ€”this is free money.
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are generally more flexible but subject to capital gains taxes. Use them for investments that generate less frequent income (like stocks).
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, so prioritize these accounts for long-term growth.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - **Income Generation:** Bonds or dividend-paying stocks might be better suited for taxable accounts due to their tax implications.

### 4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**
   - Keep sufficient liquidity in taxable accounts or a dedicated emergency fund for short-term needs.

### 5. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k):** 10-15% of your salary (up to the match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions ($6,500 in 2023, $7,500 if 50+).
- **Taxable Account:** Allocate remaining funds after maxing tax-advantaged accounts.

### Conclusion
Adjust these guidelines based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice.
