Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions. It offers tax-deferred growth but may have limited investment options.
- **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: No tax benefits but offer flexibility for withdrawals. Investment gains are subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions
1. **Maximize 401(k) contributions**: Ensure youâ€™re getting any employer match, as this is essentially free money. 
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions, depending on your income and retirement strategy.
3. **Fund taxable accounts**: Use these for flexibility or short-term needs, especially if you've maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Asset Allocation Strategy
- **Growth Investments (Stocks)**: Place in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
- **Interest-bearing Investments (Bonds)**: Consider placing in taxable accounts to minimize taxable interest in your tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Tax-efficient Funds**: Opt for index funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

### 4. Regular Review
Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in employment, income, market conditions, and retirement goals.

### Example Distribution Plan
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match + additional contributions up to IRS limit.
- **IRA**: Max out annual contributions.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest surplus funds after maxing retirement accounts.

This strategy can help balance growth potential and tax efficiency. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
