Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. 
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are after-tax, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider prioritizing this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Assess Contribution Limits**
   - Be aware of contribution limits: as of 2023, 401(k) limits are $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50), and IRA limits are $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50).

### 4. **Investment Options**
   - Evaluate the investment options available in each account. Sometimes 401(k) plans have limited options compared to IRAs or taxable accounts.

### 5. **Flexibility Needs**
   - Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals compared to retirement accounts, which often have penalties for early withdrawal.

### 6. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across different asset classes, regardless of the account type.

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Emergency Fund:** Ensure you have savings outside these accounts for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Balance Contributions:**
  - Max out employer match in 401(k).
  - Contribute to your IRA (maximize if qualified).
  - Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts.

### Regular Review
- Reassess your strategy regularly to adjust for changes in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
