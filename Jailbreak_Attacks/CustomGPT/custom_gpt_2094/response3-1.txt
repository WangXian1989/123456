To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match available; this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **Traditional IRA or Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, consider a Roth IRA. If not, a Traditional IRA may be more beneficial for tax deferral.
   - **401(k)**: If your income allows, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can invest in taxable accounts. These are more flexible for withdrawals and can provide you with income through dividends and interest.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Stocks may be better suited for a long-term growth strategy, while bonds can serve as a stabilizing force.

5. **Consider Time Horizon and Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on your goals and how close you are to needing the funds. Longer-term investments can often take on more risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation over time.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of taxes on dividends and realized capital gains in taxable accounts. Favor tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.
