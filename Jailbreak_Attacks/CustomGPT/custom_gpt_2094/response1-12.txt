I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that treatment for liver problems often depends on the underlying condition. Common options may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can support liver health.
  
2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat the underlying issue.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as needed.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
