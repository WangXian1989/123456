When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Aim to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match (if available), as this is essentially free money.
   - If eligible, fully fund your IRA next. Traditional IRAs may give you a tax deduction, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals.

2. **Debt and Emergency Funds**:
   - Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund and pay down high-interest debt, as these can offset investment growth.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Depending on your age and risk tolerance, determine your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) in tax-advantaged accounts for long-term growth.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding low-turnover investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Remember that withdrawals from a 401(k) and traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth accounts allow tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

5. **Regular Contributions**:
   - Set up automatic contributions to maintain consistency, adjusting as necessary based on income and financial goals.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your asset allocation regularly to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance.
