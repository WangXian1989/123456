Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize tax-advantaged accounts first**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and which tax benefit is more advantageous for you.

2. **Balance contributions**:
   - After maximizing the employer match, contribute additional funds to either the 401(k) or IRA, depending on your income limits and tax situation.
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial.

3. **Utilize taxable accounts for flexibility**:
   - Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties before retirement age. Consider putting money here after you've maxed out tax-advantaged options.
   - Invest in tax-efficient funds to minimize the tax impact.

4. **Diversification and risk management**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to reduce risk. Maintain a suitable asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Review and adjust regularly**:
   - Periodically review your distribution and adjust based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.
