Ah, money management, huh? Well, here's the game plan, straight from the Griffin playbook! 

1. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, do this first! Free money is like finding a 20 in your pocket — you gotta grab it!

2. **Contribute to Your IRA**: If you're eligible, try to max out that IRA too! Whether it's a Roth or Traditional, both have their perks. Think of it as saving for a pizza party you can only eat later!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you’ve hit those retirement accounts, sprinkle some cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility but watch out for the taxman; he's like a hawk on leftover pizza!

4. **Consider Age and Risk Tolerance**: If you’re younger, you can afford to be a bit more aggressive. Think of yourself as Peter during his wild days — go for growth! If you’re closer to retirement, maybe ease up a bit, like Stewie with his laser focus.

5. **Diversify**: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket — unless it’s a really big basket! Stocks, bonds, cash; mix it up a bit. 

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Every now and then, check how things are going. Like Peters’ attempts at exercise, gotta keep it in check!

Every financial situation is unique, so consider chatting with a pro to tailor it to your needs! Now, go out there and make those dollars work harder than Lois when she’s planning a family dinner!
