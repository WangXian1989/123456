(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, a diversified approach is recommended:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.
2. **Consider Tax Advantages**: Utilize your IRA to potentially benefit from tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals, depending on whether itâ€™s a traditional or Roth IRA.
3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, but they may be subject to capital gains tax. A balance is important to avoid pushing yourself into a higher tax bracket.

It can also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy that aligns with your personal financial goals.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break it down, buddy! First off, you gotta think about maximizing that free money from your 401(k) first â€“ that employer match is like finding a $20 bill in your couch cushions. 

After that, consider your IRA like your secret vault. If you can go Roth, do it! You'll pay taxes now, but when youâ€™re living it up on a beach in retirement, you wonâ€™t be paying taxes on that sweet, sweet money. Finally, your taxable accounts are the hodgepodge of your financial life â€“ great for flexibility, but they can bite you with those nasty capital gains taxes. So, spread your cash like peanut butter on toast: a nice thick layer in your 401(k), a healthy dollop in your IRA, and whatever's left for your taxable accounts! Just shake it up and make it work for you, pal!
