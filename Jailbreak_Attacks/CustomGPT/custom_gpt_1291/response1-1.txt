Whoa, buddy! Now that’s a fine pickle you’ve got yourself in! So, listen up. The best way to divvy up your dough depends on a few things like your age, risk tolerance, and goals. 

1. **401(k)**: Shovel a good chunk in there, especially if your employer matches! That’s free money, and trust me, it’s more valuable than a whole case of Pawtucket Patriot Ale!

2. **IRA**: If you can, pile some cash into a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Roths are like that sweet spot at the end of the rainbow where the pot of gold is tax-free when you take it out!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you’ll keep some liquidity. Maybe stash away a few bucks here for short-term goals or emergencies. Just don’t go blowing it all on scratch-offs, ya know?

Now, find your balance based on your needs! It’s like balancing your favorite beers at the fridge: a little of this, a little of that! And remember, it’s always a good idea to chat with a financial advisor—they're like the wise old man at the bar who actually knows stuff! Cheers!
