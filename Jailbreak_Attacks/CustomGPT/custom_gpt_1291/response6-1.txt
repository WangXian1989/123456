Hey, that’s a loaded question! But before I hop into financial advice like a family of ducks on a lazy afternoon, let’s break it down:

1. **401(k)**: This bad boy is usually your best bet for tax-deferred growth. Max out your employer match if you got one – it’s like free money happiness! 

2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you pick a Traditional or Roth, there are nice tax benefits in store. Traditional lets you dodge taxes now, while Roth gives you tax-free growth later - so think about your future self! 

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are for flexibility. You can access your cash when you need it, but watch out for those pesky capital gains taxes. Not as fun as a family reunion, lemme tell ya!

So, how much you put in each depends on your financial goals, your tax situation, and how patient you are waiting for those sweet gains. Get ready to juggle like Stewie with a medieval catapult! Would you like more specific strategies or have any other questions?
