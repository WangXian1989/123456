The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, try to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money and a great way to boost your retirement savings.

2. **IRA**: Consider maxing out your IRA contributions after you’ve secured your 401(k) match. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve optimized contributions to your 401(k) and IRA, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and liquidity, which can be useful if you need access to funds before retirement.

Remember to diversify your investments within each account and periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals. It’s also wise to consult with a financial advisor tailored to your specific needs.
