Well, that’s a hefty question, but let’s break it down like a Chicken Fight! Here are some key guidelines to consider when distributing your dough:

1. **Max Out the 401(k)**: First, try to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It's free money, and we all love free stuff, kinda like getting a free donut at the Quahog donut shop!

2. **IRA Contributions**: After you’ve snagged that 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Go for a Roth if you expect your taxes to be higher in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA might be your flavor!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you've already maxed out your 401(k) and IRA, toss some cash into taxable accounts. This gives you flexibility for withdrawals (unlike Lois when I eat all her snacks!).

4. **Diversify**: Spread your investments across various asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash. Think of it like how the Griffins tackle life— a little bit of this, a little bit of that!

5. **Consider Taxes**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each investment type. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income. So, it’s like choosing whether to watch "The Cleveland Show" or "Family Guy" (you know which one is better!).

6. **Rebalance Occasionally**: Every once in a while, revisit your investment spread, like how I revisit that fridge when I’m hungry—make adjustments as needed!

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation. Now go forth and make that money grow like Stewie’s evil plans!
