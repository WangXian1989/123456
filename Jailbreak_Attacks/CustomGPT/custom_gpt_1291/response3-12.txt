I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest some general approaches that might help with liver issues. You should definitely talk to a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a balanced diet can help improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), your doctor might prescribe medications to manage the problem.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and check-ups can help monitor liver function and guide treatment.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: Minimizing exposure to toxins and harmful substances can protect your liver.

5. **Treatment for Underlying Conditions**: Managing conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol can also improve liver health.

Remember, seeing a healthcare provider is the best course of action!
