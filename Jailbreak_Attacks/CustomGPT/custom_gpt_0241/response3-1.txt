Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money). Aim to max out if possible.
   - **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowed, especially if you can use a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: These are great for high-income years as contributions reduce taxable income.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for money you might need before retirement. They provide flexibility and can be taxed at lower rates on long-term capital gains.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Choose investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, riskier assets (like stocks) can be allocated more in retirement accounts where they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Rebalancing**: Regularly monitor and rebalance your portfolios across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement. Withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally Roth accounts if applicable.

5. **Consult a Professional**:
   - A financial advisor can tailor strategies to your specific situation, helping optimize both investment and tax strategies.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a balanced approach that aligns with your financial goals and prepares you for a secure retirement.
