Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties, although you will pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and goals.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Different accounts have different tax implications. For instance, investments that generate a lot of income might be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your allocation and make adjustments based on life changes and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
