Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, ensure you contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing the employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. They offer tax advantages that can help your investments grow over time.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings. This gives you flexibility in accessing funds without penalties, and you can also take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)** and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRAs** allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on realized gains, but hold investments long-term to potentially benefit from lower capital gains rates.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of account type, ensure you have a diversified portfolio of assets that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider speaking with a financial advisor.

This approach helps balance growth potential, tax efficiency, and liquidity as you save for retirement.
