To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Try to contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions**: Max out your IRA to benefit from tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (traditional).

### 2. **Balance According to Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for funds you might need before retirement or to take advantage of lower capital gains tax rates.
   - **Asset Allocation**: Place bonds and income-generating assets in tax-advantaged accounts. Keep high-growth investments in taxable accounts to benefit from favorable capital gains treatment.

### 3. **Consider Your Income and Goals**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on risk factors corresponding with each account. Higher risk can be beneficial in long-term tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how and when youâ€™ll access these accounts to minimize taxes during retirement.

### Conclusion
By maximizing your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts while maintaining a balanced and strategic approach to your taxable accounts, you can optimize your investments for both growth and tax efficiency. Always reassess based on changes in your financial situation and tax laws.
