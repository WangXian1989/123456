To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Max out contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Investment Types**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Invest in growth-oriented assets (stocks, mutual funds) for long-term appreciation, as withdrawals are taxed.
   - **Tax-Free Accounts (Roth IRA)**: Suitable for investments with high growth potential since withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments generating qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - Short-term needs might be better served in taxable accounts, while long-term investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**:
   - Hold bonds or assets with higher turnover in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have liquid cash available for emergencies, rather than relying solely on investment accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your financial situation.
