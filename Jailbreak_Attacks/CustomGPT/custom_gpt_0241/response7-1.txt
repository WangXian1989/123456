Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that might generate taxable income (like bonds) or for short-term goals as these funds can be accessed without penalties.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place less tax-efficient investments (high-yield bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient ones (index funds, ETFs) in taxable accounts.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure diversification across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on your goals and market performance.

Consult a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
