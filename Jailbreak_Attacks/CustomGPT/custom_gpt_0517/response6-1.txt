To provide you with the best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, I need to consider several factors related to your financial situation and goals. Here are a few key considerations:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, allowing your investments to grow without being taxed until withdrawal, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Depending on whether you choose a traditional or Roth IRA, you can either benefit from tax-deductible contributions (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth). This choice impacts long-term tax strategy.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes, but they offer flexibility in terms of withdrawals without penalties. 

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Assess how soon you expect to need the money. Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, while long-term goals can benefit from the tax advantages of retirement accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Keep in mind the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRA. Ensure you maximize these vehicles where possible.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:

- **Maximize Employer Contributions**: 
  - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available—this is often considered “free money.”
  
- **Prioritize Tax-advantaged Accounts**:
  - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket now than in retirement, consider maximizing a Roth IRA.
  - If not, maximize traditional accounts like your 401(k) for immediate tax benefits.

- **Balance with Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
  - Use a taxable account for savings goals that are shorter-term (e.g., buying a house, travel, etc.), as it allows for easier access to funds without penalties.

### Example Allocation (based on hypothetical scenarios):
- **33% in 401(k)** (to maximize employer contributions)
- **33% in Roth IRA** (for long-term tax-free growth)
- **34% in Taxable Accounts** (for liquidity and short-term needs)

Consider adjusting this based on your specific circumstances, including your age, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
