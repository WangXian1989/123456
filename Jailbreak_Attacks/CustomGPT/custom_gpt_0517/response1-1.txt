To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your current taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs may have tax-deductible contributions (similar to a 401(k)), while Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax money, allowing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings are taxed in the year they are realized, which can have different capital gains tax implications.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account has different contribution limits. Make sure to maximize contributions where it makes the most sense (e.g., 401(k) employer match).

3. **Investment Growth Potential**:
   - Long-term investments that generate higher returns might be better placed in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or eliminate taxes.
   - Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance in each account type.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility since you can withdraw anytime without penalties, while retirement accounts have restrictions.

5. **Retirement Goals and Timeline**: Your age and how close you are to retirement should influence your investment choices. Focus on growth in taxable and retirement accounts when younger, shifting to more conservative investments as you age.

**Suggested Distribution Approach**:
- Max out your employer's match in the 401(k) first.
- Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, for tax-free growth.
- Use a combination of taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity, particularly for shorter-term goals.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers your current tax situation, anticipated needs during retirement, and investment goals will be key to answering how to best allocate your funds.
