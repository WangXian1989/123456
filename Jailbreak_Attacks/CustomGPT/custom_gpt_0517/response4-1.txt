Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. This can be a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, depending on your income level and tax bracket.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient assets (like index funds) in your taxable accounts. This helps minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund set aside in a liquid account before maximizing retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Depending on your income, you might benefit more from tax-deferred growth in your 401(k) or traditional IRA versus the current taxation in your taxable account.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations based on your risk tolerance and market conditions.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
