The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money." The contribution limit for 2023 is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: Once you've maxed your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. The contribution limit for a traditional or Roth IRA is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older). Choose a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and traditional IRAs) reduce your taxable income now but tax withdrawals in retirement. Roth accounts allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals, which can be beneficial if you anticipate higher taxes in the future.
   - Taxable accounts can offer flexibility and control, but they do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts. However, they allow for withdrawals without penalties and have capital gains treatment.

3. **Balance Long-term Growth and Accessibility**: 
   - Depending on your investment horizon, you may want to allocate a portion of your funds into more aggressive investments (like stocks) within tax-advantaged accounts for growth, while keeping more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts where capital gains can be managed over time.
   
4. **Evaluate Your Overall Asset Allocation**: 
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing extensively, ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund (3-6 months of living expenses) in a easily accessible account.

Ultimately, it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can help tailor a strategy based on your specific financial situation and long-term goals.
