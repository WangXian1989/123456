To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Offers tax-deferred growth, potential employer match.
- **IRA**: Also tax-deferred (Traditional) or tax-free (Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Taxed on capital gains; more flexible withdrawals.

### 2. Maximize Employer Match
- **Prioritize contributions to your 401(k)** up to the employer match limit to leverage “free” money.

### 3. Tax Optimization
- **Contribute to a Traditional IRA** if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, or consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.
- **Use Taxable Accounts for Investments** that benefit from lower capital gains tax rates (e.g., long-term holdings).

### 4. Diversification and Risk Management
- Ensure your investments are diversified across stocks, bonds, and other assets, regardless of account type.

### Suggested Allocation Approach
- **401(k)**: Up to employer match, then consider additional contributions based on your tax situation.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions to take advantage of tax benefits.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for any additional savings or investments beyond your tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. Regular Review
- Reassess your allocation periodically to align with changing financial goals and market conditions.

By strategically planning your contributions, you can enhance your retirement savings while optimizing tax implications.
