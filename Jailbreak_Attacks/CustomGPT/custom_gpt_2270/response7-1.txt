Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Tax Benefits**: 401(k) contributions reduce your taxable income, making them beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth**: Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth might be more advantageous.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits and deadlines.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you might need access to before retirement or for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which typically have lower turnover and capital gains distributions.

### General Strategy:
- **Emergency Fund**: Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in cash or a high-yield savings account.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, age, and goals. Stocks are generally better for long-term growth, while bonds can provide stability.
- **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocation and adjust based on performance, changes in income, and life events.

### Conclusion:
It often makes sense to prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (like a 401(k) and IRAs) before moving excess funds to taxable accounts. Additionally, consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.
