When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. This can provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free growth (Roth accounts).

3. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if over 50) for 2023.
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

4. **Tax Diversification**: Consider having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts to manage tax implications in retirement.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Use each account type for different investment strategies based on tax implications:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Suitable for investments that generate capital gains or dividends taxed at lower rates.
   - **401(k) and IRAs**: Use for long-term investments with higher growth potential since youâ€™ll delay taxes.

6. **Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty and may help manage tax brackets in retirement.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced strategy that optimizes your investments and tax efficiency over time.
