Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are several key considerations:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits ($22,500 for 2024, or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **Investment Options**: Choose funds that align with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions, taxes on withdrawal) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) is more beneficial for you, especially based on your current and expected future tax brackets.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500 in 2024 ($7,500 if you're over 50).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties and can include diverse investments.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Dividend Considerations**: Be mindful of how dividends and interest from investments will be taxed.

### **General Strategy**
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Max out 401(k) contributions first, then work on IRAs, followed by taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on risk tolerance.
- **Review Regularly**: Reassess your allocation periodically to ensure alignment with your goals, especially as you approach retirement.
