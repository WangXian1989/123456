I'm sorry to hear that you're having liver issues. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options for liver problems can vary greatly depending on the specific condition you're experiencing, such as hepatitis, fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Common approaches might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, surgical options like a liver transplant. Please reach out to a qualified doctor for guidance tailored to your situation.
