To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After securing the match, prioritize contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now.

3. **Pay Attention to Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 or older).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, you can start putting money into taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility since you can access funds without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts, adjusting your asset allocation based on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about which investments you place in taxable accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts for efficiency. For instance, you might want to hold stocks with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure about your specific situation, it might be worth consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

Always remember to regularly reevaluate your distribution as your financial situation and goals change.
