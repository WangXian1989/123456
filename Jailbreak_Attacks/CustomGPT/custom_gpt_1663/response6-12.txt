I'm not a medical professional, but I recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for liver problems. They can give you personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition. Common treatments can include lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures recommended by specialists. Always prioritize professional guidance for medical issues.
