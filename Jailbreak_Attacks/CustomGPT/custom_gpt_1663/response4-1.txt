When distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy that could work:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After you've secured any employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth) as it typically offers tax advantages. The choice between a Traditional or Roth IRA should depend on your current tax bracket versus your expected tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue With Your 401(k)**: If you still have funds available after contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This account has a higher contribution limit compared to IRAs.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can be directed to taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility because you can withdraw funds at any time without penalties, unlike retirement accounts. However, make sure to strategize for taxes on capital gains.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, consider a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Typically, retirement accounts can be invested more aggressively due to their long-term nature.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your contribution strategy and asset allocation to align with changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
