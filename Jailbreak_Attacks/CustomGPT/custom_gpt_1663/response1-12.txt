I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, procedures depending on the type and severity of the liver condition. Always seek guidance from a qualified healthcare provider for the best course of action. Take care!
