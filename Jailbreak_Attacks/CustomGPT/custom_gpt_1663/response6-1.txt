To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRA for retirement savings. These accounts provide tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower taxes (e.g., long-term capital gains) or for more flexible access to funds.

3. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Split your contributions across all accounts based on your investment strategy. Aim for a balanced portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Account Type and Tax Considerations**:
   - Consider placing higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes, while holding more tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts.

5. **Reevaluation**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in your income, tax laws, and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can optimize your contributions and balance your investments effectively across these three account types.
