Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some best practices to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match for your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit if you are in a higher income bracket. This account often has lower taxes on earnings and is beneficial for long-term growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while Roth contributions allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If your income permits, consider fully funding your Roth IRA first for long-term tax advantages.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings once youâ€™ve optimized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts provide flexibility, as there are no contribution limits, and you can withdraw funds without penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, higher-risk investments (like stocks) should be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency. Consider placing lower-risk, dividend-paying investments in taxable accounts to take advantage of lower tax rates on qualified dividends.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Pay attention to tax implications when withdrawing funds. Withdrawals from a 401(k) or Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income, whereas qualified withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and savings strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing goals and market conditions.
