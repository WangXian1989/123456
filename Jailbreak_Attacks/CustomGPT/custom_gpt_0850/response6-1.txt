To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits and potential employer matching.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages, with Roth IRAs allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Greater flexibility in access and withdrawal but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any matching contributions from your employerâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Build IRA Contributions**: Aim to fully fund your IRA, especially if you qualify for a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free growth.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these for savings goals that are more immediate or for investments that may generate tax-efficient income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Retirement Accounts**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (stocks, index funds) in 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds or low-turnover funds) to minimize taxable gains.

### 4. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly assess your asset distribution and rebalance to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

By understanding the unique characteristics and benefits of each account type, you can create a strategic distribution plan aligned with your financial goals.
