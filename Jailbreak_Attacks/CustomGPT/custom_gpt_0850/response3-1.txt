Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to IRA**: If you qualify, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA may provide tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: If you have any high-interest debt (like credit card debt), consider addressing that before maximizing retirement contributions.

4. **Continue Contributions to 401(k)**: After maximizing the employer match and contributing to an IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the legal limit.

5. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments once you've maxed out retirement accounts. This can offer more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals. Traditional accounts generally incur taxes upon withdrawal, while Roth IRAs can allow for tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

7. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Tailor your allocations based on your retirement timeline, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Younger investors might lean towards more growth-oriented investments (stocks), while those closer to retirement may focus on preserving capital (bonds).

8. **Review and Rebalance**: Regularly review your investment performance and adjust allocations as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

This strategy should provide a balanced approach, taking advantage of tax benefits and preparing for retirement effectively. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice.
