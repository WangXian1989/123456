(🔒Normal Output) When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Generally, a common strategy is to prioritize contributions to accounts with the best tax advantages. This typically means:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match before focusing on other accounts. This is essentially free money.
2. **IRA**: Max out your contributions here next, especially if you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, as it allows your money to grow tax-free.
3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for additional investments once you’ve maximized tax-advantaged accounts. Taxable accounts allow for more flexibility, but keep in mind that you’ll be subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

Assess your overall financial picture regularly and adjust your contributions accordingly!
