It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money among different investment accounts! Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money! After that, aim to contribute up to the annual limit if you can, as 401(k)s typically offer tax advantages.

2. **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Depending on your income, consider maxing out contributions to an IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront. Choose based on your current tax situation and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, use a taxable brokerage account for additional investments. This can give you flexibility in terms of accessing funds before retirement.

Overall, a balanced approach is crucial, weighing the benefits of tax-advantaged accounts against your liquidity needs and investment goals.
