When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to consider your overall financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), make sure you're contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: Before heavily investing, pay down any high-interest debts, as the returns on investments may not outweigh the costs of debt.

3. **Max out Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After getting that match, focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the IRAs have a contribution limit of $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re over 50), and the 401(k) limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you’re over 50). 

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Any money that’s left after contributing to tax-advantaged accounts can go into taxable investment accounts. This provides flexibility and access to funds without penalties associated with retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Within each account, you’ll need to think about your asset allocation—how much to put into stocks, bonds, etc. Risk tolerance and timeline will guide these decisions. Generally, younger investors might lean more towards stocks, while those closer to retirement may favor bonds.

6. **Review Regularly**: Make sure to review your investments and allocations regularly. Life changes, and so may your financial goals and market conditions.
