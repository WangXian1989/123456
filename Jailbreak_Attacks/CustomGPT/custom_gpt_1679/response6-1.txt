To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim to maximize your contributions up to the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider whether a Traditional or Roth IRA aligns better with your tax situation. A Traditional IRA offers tax-deductible contributions, while a Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Financial Goals**:
   - **Time Horizon**: Short-term goals may be better served by taxable accounts, while long-term retirement goals can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Ensure you maintain some liquidity in taxable accounts for any immediate expenses or opportunities while allowing retirement accounts to grow tax-deferred.

3. **Portfolio Diversification**:
   - Allocate assets based on risk tolerance across all accounts:
     - Stocks in taxable accounts for potential growth.
     - Bonds and stable investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact on interest income.
   - Adjust your allocation as necessary based on market conditions and life changes.

4. **Consider Individual Tax Situations**:
   - If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA or after-tax investments today.
   - Conversely, if you expect a lower tax rate in retirement, traditional accounts may be more beneficial.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Conduct periodic checks on your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.

By strategically distributing your funds across these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while minimizing tax liabilities over time.
