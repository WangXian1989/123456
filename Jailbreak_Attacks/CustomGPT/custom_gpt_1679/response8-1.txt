Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your income level, tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer 401(k) Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money into an IRA or taxable accounts. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Max Out Your 401(k)**: If possible, continue to make contributions to your 401(k) up to the federal limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth on your investments.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and IRAs, if you have additional funds to invest, you can use taxable accounts. This provides flexibility since you can withdraw money at any time without penalties (though you will owe taxes on any gains).

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: When investing in taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) that minimize capital gains distributions.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your asset allocation is in line with your risk tolerance and investment goals across all account types. 

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your distribution strategy to ensure it continues to meet your financial goals and adjust as needed for changes in income, taxes, and investment performance.

It’s always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.
