To determine the best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on them until you withdraw them in retirement. Some employers offer matching contributions, which can significantly boost your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met. 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Earnings from these accounts (like dividends and capital gains) are taxable in the year they're realized, but they offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account type has different contribution limits. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50). For IRAs, the limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Ensure you’re maximizing your contributions where possible.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider what investments are available in each account. 401(k) plans may have limited options, whereas IRAs and taxable accounts typically offer a broader range of investment choices.
   - Your investment strategy might also shift depending on the account type, as tax-efficient investments are often better suited for taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**: Plan for how and when you will need to access these funds. Generally, it’s advisable to let retirement accounts grow as long as possible to maximize tax advantages. Taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them more suitable for shorter-term financial needs.

5. **Diversification Across Accounts**: It can be beneficial to diversify your investments not just within each account but across all account types. This means balancing risk and returns across all your investments.

6. **Risk Tolerance**: Assess your comfort with risk for each account, especially as you approach retirement. Adjusting the asset allocation based on your age and risk tolerance is vital.

7. **Financial Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your long-term financial goals and retirement timeline. 

A common strategy is prioritizing contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, then contributing to an IRA for its tax advantages, and finally, using any remaining funds for a taxable account. Adjust this strategy based on your individual situation and financial goals.
