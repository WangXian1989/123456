Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your income, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement or a Traditional IRA for tax deduction benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Taxable accounts may be more suitable for investments you plan to sell in the near term, as you’ll pay capital gains taxes on profits.
   - Keep high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax burdens.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your investment strategy aligns across all accounts. Hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

4. **Rebalance Annually**:
   - Review your asset allocation periodically and rebalance your investments to stay aligned with your goals.

5. **Factor in Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan how you’ll withdraw funds in retirement. This can influence how you prioritize savings now.

6. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient liquid savings before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
