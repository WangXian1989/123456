Determining the best way to distribute your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of considerations for each type of account:

### 401(k) Accounts
- **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: Contributions reduce taxable income, allowing your investments to grow without immediate tax implications.
- **Investment Options**: Check the fees and investment options available in your plan.

### IRA Accounts
- **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide whether a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) or a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) fits your tax strategy better. Roth IRAs are generally favored if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
- **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and eligibility based on income.

### Taxable Accounts
- **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide flexibility and can be accessed without penalties.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits. Consider holding longer-term investments to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

### Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer contributions.
2. **Contribute to IRAs**: Next, consider funding an IRA, especially if you’re eligible for Roth contributions.
3. **Prioritize Taxable Accounts**: After maxing these accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts, especially for short- to medium-term goals.

### Example Allocation
- **401(k)**: 15% of your income.
- **IRA**: Max out contributions (current limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remaining funds as needed.

### Regular Review
Reassess your strategy periodically based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, and retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice suited to your specific circumstances.
