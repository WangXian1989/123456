Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction on contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on whether you want to pay taxes now (Roth) or later (Traditional).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes on profits. Use these accounts for investments that generate long-term capital gains or for short-term needs.

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider fully funding your IRA (up to the limit).
   - Any additional savings can be allocated to your taxable account.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across accounts to account for different tax treatments. For example, place higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in an IRA) and consider safer investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Adjust Based on Goals**: Think about your time horizon:
   - **Short-term goals**: Use taxable accounts for more liquidity.
   - **Long-term growth**: Focus on maximizing 401(k) and IRA contributions.

6. **Re-evaluate Regularly**: Monitor your investment performance and tax situation regularly and adjust your distribution strategy as needed.
