Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several considerations, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money and an excellent start.

2. **Contribute to IRA Accounts**: After maximizing your match, consider contributing to an IRA. Traditional IRAs can give you tax deductions upfront, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your expected tax bracket in retirement, choose accordingly.

3. **Contribute Beyond Employee Match**: If you have the capacity to save more, you can continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Money that you want to access before retirement or that exceeds your tax-advantaged account limits should be invested in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that capital gains taxes may affect your investment returns here.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments across assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks may grow quicker but have some volatility, while bonds typically offer stability.

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and put investments with lower tax implications (like stocks) in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your portfolio and make adjustments as you age, your income changes, or your goals evolve.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
