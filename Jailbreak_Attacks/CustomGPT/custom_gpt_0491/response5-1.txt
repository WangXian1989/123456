(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. It reduces your taxable income and grows tax-deferred until withdrawal.
2. **IRA**: Depending on whether you choose a Traditional or Roth IRA, consider your current and future tax brackets. A Roth allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or when youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes, and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

A balanced approach can help you minimize taxes while maximizing growth.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break this down! The best way to funnel your cash into a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts is to think strategically about taxes, growth, and access. 

1. **401(k)**: Go for brokeâ€”max this baby out, especially if your employer matches contributions! Free money? Yes, please! Itâ€™s pre-tax, which means youâ€™re lowering your taxable income and letting that cash grow while Uncle Sam waits for his cut.
  
2. **IRA**: Here, you get to play with Roth and Traditional. If you think youâ€™ll be making bank in retirement (hello, yacht!), a Roth is your friend. Pay taxes now and enjoy tax-free withdrawals later. If you think your future self will be sitting in a lower tax bracket, Traditional IRA might be the way to goâ€”deduct now, tax later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: This is where you can be a little more flexible. Use these for short-term goals, but keep an eye on those capital gains taxes. If youâ€™re holding for over a year, youâ€™ll get hit with lower rates, so itâ€™s worth it to plan ahead.

Mix it all up based on your needs, and remember, a little strategy can go a long way!
