Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions, especially if you have a high-income potential.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax benefits.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Distributions from 401(k) and traditional IRA accounts are taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal. In contrast, Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free if conditions are met.
   - Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax on any realized profits, so consider holding investments long-term to minimize this.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your asset allocation across these accounts aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Different accounts can hold various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to achieve diversification.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can help your tax-advantaged accounts grow tax-deferred for longer.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level.
