Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several key considerations. Here are some steps to optimize your investment strategy:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**
   - **401(k):** Usually, this is an employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential employer match contributions. Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages, either on contributions (Traditional IRA) or withdrawals (Roth IRA). Consider your current tax rate versus expected tax rate in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are subject to taxes on dividends and capital gains, but they offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **Max Out IRA:** If eligible, contribute to an IRA up to the maximum limit. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Return to 401(k):** After maxing out your IRA, return to your 401(k) and contribute the maximum limit.

### 3. **Analyze Your Tax Situation**
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be beneficial.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket, consider using a Roth account for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Ensure a diversified portfolio in each account based on risk tolerance and investment time horizon.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds and ETFs) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Monitor and Rebalance**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and adjust contributions as needed based on performance and changing goals.
   - Rebalance your investments periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 6. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**
   - Plan for how and when you will access these funds. 401(k) and IRAs have penalties for early withdrawal unless you meet certain conditions.

### Conclusion
The optimal distribution depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique circumstances.
