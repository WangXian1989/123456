Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match before investing elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Aim to max out contributions if your employer matches.
   - **IRAs**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: If you're in a lower tax bracket now but expect to be in a higher one in retirement, a Roth IRA might provide more benefits. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket, a Traditional IRA may be more advantageous.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Taxable accounts can provide flexibility and access to funds without penalties. Consider holding assets that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to minimize taxes.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance**: As your financial situation changes, periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking advice tailored to your specific situation to optimize your strategy.
