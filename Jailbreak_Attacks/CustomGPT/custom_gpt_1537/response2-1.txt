Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **Employer Match:** If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of it first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Debt and Emergency Fund:** Before maximizing retirement accounts, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) and consider paying down high-interest debt.

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, which means you won’t pay taxes on this income until you withdraw it in retirement. Suitable for those in higher tax brackets now.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar benefits as a 401(k), but with income limits for deductibility. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this is a good option.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made after-tax, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Ideal if you expect your tax rate to increase or if you're starting your career with a lower income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are flexible and allow easy access to funds, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits. Useful for medium-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments between stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, keep riskier investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to defer taxes on growth.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. It's often tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Everyone’s situation is unique, so consider working with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that aligns with your specific goals and circumstances.

### Summary
Generally, start with contributions to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, followed by funding IRAs (considering a Roth if eligible), and use taxable accounts for additional saving once you've maxed out retirement accounts.
