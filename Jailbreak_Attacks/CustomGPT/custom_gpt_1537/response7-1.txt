Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and when you plan to access the funds. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Retirement Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - After that, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions reduce your taxable income now, providing an immediate tax benefit. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxable.
   - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts can be more flexible but are subject to capital gains taxes on earnings. They may be suitable for investments that you plan to hold for a shorter term or that yield higher dividends.

3. **Asset Allocation and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRAs) where they can grow without immediate tax consequences.
   - Consider placing lower-risk investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Emergency Fund and Liquidity**:
   - Ensure you have an emergency fund in a liquid account (e.g., a savings account) before heavily investing in retirement accounts. 

5. **Ongoing Review**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation and contributions based on changes in income, expenses, market conditions, and retirement goals.

It's wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor a plan that fits your specific circumstances.
