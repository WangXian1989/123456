To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. Taxes are paid upon withdrawal, usually during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) but offers more investment options. Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions but tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax upon sale and taxes on dividends and interest income in the year they are earned.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your time horizon and risk tolerance. Long-term investments may benefit from tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Ensure you're maximizing contributions to each account based on IRS limits. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

4. **Diversification**:
   - Allocate your investments based on diversification principles. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk profile.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you'll withdraw funds in retirement. You might want to tap taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k)), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

### Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.
2. **Consider IRAs**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate high dividends or interest, which could be taxed at a higher rate in your 401(k) or IRA.

This approach allows you to balance tax advantages with investment flexibility, catering to both immediate and long-term financial goals. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
