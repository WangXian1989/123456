Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general guideline to help you with your strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (traditional or Roth) because they offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your growth over time.

3. **Consider Taxes**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer a similar tax benefit as 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains taxes when you sell investments for a profit. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Evaluate Investment Options**: 
   - Use your 401(k) for investments that align with your long-term growth goals but may have higher volatility.
   - Utilize IRAs for more diversified investments and strategies you may not have in your 401(k).
   - Keep more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Goals**: As you approach retirement, gradually shift towards more conservative investments to protect your capital.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals by reviewing and rebalancing your investments periodically.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who can tailor a distribution plan to your individual situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a more effective strategy for distributing your investments among your different accounts.
