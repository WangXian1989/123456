Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA and 401(k))**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to your retirement accounts. The limits can change yearly, so check the current limits for both the 401(k) and IRA.

3. **IRAs**: If you have the option for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs give you a tax deduction now, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a higher tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for more liquidity. This is useful if you anticipate needing access to your funds before retirement.

5. **Diverse Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, cash) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, younger investors might lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds for stability.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly assess and adjust your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If your situation is complex, consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Tailor this strategy to your individual needs and remember that it’s important to regularly review and adjust your plan as necessary!
