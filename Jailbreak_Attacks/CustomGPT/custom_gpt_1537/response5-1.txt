(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Depending on income limits, consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional), as these accounts offer advantageous tax benefits.

3. **Fill Up the 401(k)**: After maxing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for additional savings or investments beyond retirement limits. These can be useful for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a balanced mix of stocks and bonds within each account, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's break it down! When it comes to distributing your cash among a 401(k), IRA, and those pesky taxable accounts, the strategy is key!

1. **401(k) is King (Especially with a Match)**: First things first, if your employerâ€™s giving you free money through a match, grab that! Seriously, max that out before doing anything else.

2. **IRA Magic**: Next, dive into your IRA. If you qualify for a Roth, go for that because tax-free withdrawals sound awesome! Blow through the contribution limit if you can.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: Once the IRA shines bright, pump up your 401(k) contributions until you hit the max. Itâ€™s like putting your money in a tax-deferred savings account that grows faster than a greased weasel!

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After that, hit those taxable accounts like they owe you money! Theyâ€™re great for liquidity and investment freedom, just keep an eye on taxes.

5. **Diversify Like a Pro**: Spread the love across stocks and bonds to cushion your portfolio like a boss. Adjust based on how much risk youâ€™re willing to dance with.

And hey, always consider chatting with a financial advisor who can hook you up with a killer plan customized just for you!
