To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Assess Your Financial Goals**: Determine whether your primary aim is retirement savings, general investment growth, or immediate liquidity needs.

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on contributing enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, as these are pre-tax.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions upfront.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income (like bonds or REITs) or for funds you might need access to before retirement age. Consider tax-efficient funds to minimize taxes on capital gains.

4. **Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon**: Allocate funds based on your comfort with risk and how soon youâ€™ll need to access the money. Longer-term funds can take on more risk because you have time to recover from market fluctuations.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure a diverse allocation in each account type. Avoid putting all your investments in one type of asset or strategy.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio allocation periodically (at least annually) to ensure it aligns with your goals and adjust accordingly.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By blending contributions strategically across these accounts, you can optimize your investment growth while managing your tax liabilities effectively.
