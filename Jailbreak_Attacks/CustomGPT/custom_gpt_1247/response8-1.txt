To optimize your investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Allocate as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA contributions, as they offer tax advantages. Contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match is typically a priority, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Type of Investments**: Utilize tax-efficient investments in your taxable account (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes. Place higher-taxed investments (e.g., bonds, REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a strategic asset allocation consistent with your risk tolerance across all accounts. This includes balancing stocks, bonds, and cash appropriately.

4. **Rebalancing**: Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts, taking tax implications into account.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: When it comes time to withdraw funds, consider which accounts to draw from first to minimize taxes. For example, it often makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs) last.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity and individual nature of investment strategies, consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.

This approach will help you distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts while maximizing your long-term financial growth.
