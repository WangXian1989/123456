To effectively distribute your funds amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategic recommendations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Maximize Tax-Deferred Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match, as this is essentially "free money". 
   - **Prioritize IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for the tax-free growth potential or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

2. **Investment Allocation**:
   - **Risk Assessment**: Determine your risk tolerance and investment goals, then allocate a percentage of your portfolio to stocks, bonds, and other assets accordingly.
   - **Asset Location**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer tax on capital gains. Use taxable accounts for more stable investments that produce taxable income (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks).

3. **Regular Review**:
   - **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: Periodically review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your intended risk profile and investment strategy.
   - **Adjust Contributions Based on Performance**: If one account grows significantly, consider shifting new contributions to maintain balance across your accounts.

4. **Consultation with Financial Advisor**: 
   - Engaging a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your financial situation.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can strategically distribute your money to maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
