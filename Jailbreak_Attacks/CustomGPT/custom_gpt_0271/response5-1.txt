To optimize your investment distribution among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, then consider maxing out contributions if feasible.
   - **IRA**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed, benefiting from tax-deferred growth (traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth IRA).

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have high turnover or generate significant dividends, as they face different tax treatment. Consider holding lower-yield, long-term investments here.

3. **Asset Placement**:
   - Place higher-growth assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit more from tax-deferred growth. Keep more bond-like or income-generating securities in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains.

4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - Consider your current and expected future tax brackets to decide where to put your money. Higher income can lead to higher taxes on withdrawals, making tax-deferred growth more attractive.

5. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Rebalance periodically to ensure your investments align with your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies can also be beneficial.
