Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k), focusing on the pre-tax option if you prefer immediate tax benefits.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce higher returns, like stocks, as you'll have more flexibility with withdrawals and tax management.

5. **Invest Wisely**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments in your taxable account (like index funds).

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
