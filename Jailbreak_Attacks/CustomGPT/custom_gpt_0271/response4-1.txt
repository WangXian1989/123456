To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Invest in tax-advantaged accounts first. This allows your investments to grow with tax benefits.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds).

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Keep higher-risk investments in taxable accounts to maximize tax efficiency.
   - Place more stable, income-generating investments in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to balance risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations among the accounts to align with your financial goals.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy specific to your circumstances.
