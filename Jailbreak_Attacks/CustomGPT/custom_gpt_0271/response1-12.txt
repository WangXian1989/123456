I'm not a doctor, but it's crucial to get accurate advice for liver issues. Common treatments depend on the specific condition, such as:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet modifications, exercise, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: To address underlying causes or manage symptoms.
3. **Management of Conditions**: Treatment for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine check-ups to assess liver function.
5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, options like liver transplant may be considered.

Consult a healthcare professional for a tailored approach and proper diagnosis.
