To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) over taxable accounts. These accounts offer tax deferral or tax-free growth, which can significantly enhance your long-term returns.

3. **Income Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth accounts**: Contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth options.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **Higher risk investments** (like stocks) are often better suited for tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
   - **Bonds and income-generating assets** may be more suitable for taxable accounts to minimize tax implications, as interest income is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review your investment allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so consider working with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient portfolio.
