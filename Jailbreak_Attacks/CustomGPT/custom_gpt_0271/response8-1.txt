Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (Roth or Traditional) for additional tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may give you immediate tax benefits.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After maxing the IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, as this provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement. These accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals and can be used for short-term goals or emergencies.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, more aggressive investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to enhance compounding.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and your changing financial situation.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific needs.
