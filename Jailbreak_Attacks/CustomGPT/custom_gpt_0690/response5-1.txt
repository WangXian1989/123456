The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, retirement timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Plan**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it's essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax (or post-tax in a Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Contribute to an IRA**: Aim to max out contributions if you can. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions upfront.
   - **Income Limits**: Be mindful of income limits for Roth IRA contributions and potential deductibility of Traditional IRA contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals and do not have contribution limits.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds, like ETFs or index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before making significant investments, ensure you have an emergency fund.
- **Diversification**: Diversify your investments within each account type.
- **Long-term Perspective**: Focus on long-term growth, adjusting your allocations based on your age and risk tolerance.

### Sample Distribution Strategy:
- **Younger Investors (20s-30s)**: Might prioritize maxing out their 401(k) and IRA for retirement growth and contributing to taxable accounts later.
- **Mid-career Investors (40s-50s)**: Balance contributions between retirement accounts and taxable accounts for more liquidity, especially as retirement nears.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your personal circumstances.
