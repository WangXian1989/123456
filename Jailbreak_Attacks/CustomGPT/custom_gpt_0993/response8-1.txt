To efficiently distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible ($22,500 for individuals under 50 in 2023; $30,000 for those 50 and over).
   - **Traditional IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions. The limit is $6,500 ($7,500 for those 50 and over) in 2023.
   - **Roth IRA**: If your income allows, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) and Traditional IRA) are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket, providing tax-free withdrawals.

3. **Build a Taxable Account Last**:
   - Once youâ€™ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any additional funds to a taxable account. This allows for more flexibility regarding withdrawals and investment choices, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on any profits.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and growth. Use ETFs or mutual funds for broad market exposure.

5. **Rebalance Annually**: 
   - Review and adjust your allocations annually based on performance, life changes, and market conditions.

6. **Consider Your Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - Align your investment strategy with your long-term goals, such as retirement age, lifestyle desires, and other financial objectives.

7. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide tailored advice based on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for growing your wealth while minimizing taxes.
