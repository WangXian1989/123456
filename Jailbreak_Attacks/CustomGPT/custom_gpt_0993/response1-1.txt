Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment as a 401(k). Consider this if you're eligible for tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. This is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These don’t have the same tax advantages but offer flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**: Each account can hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments. Consider using tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts, and higher-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have enough liquid savings outside of these accounts for emergencies.

5. **Review Regularly**: Periodically assess your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and retirement goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation.

This approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth potential while considering liquidity and risk.
