1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol can significantly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Nutritional Support**: Supplements or dietary adjustments may be recommended to support liver function.

4. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function and progression of the disease.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always follow the guidance of a healthcare provider for the best course of action.
