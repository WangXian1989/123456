Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: After maxing out the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions.

3. **Focus on Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize investing in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term goals. These accounts grow tax-deferred or tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or for investments that generate lower taxable income (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

4. **Asset Location**: Place more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement, as different accounts will have different tax implications.

Before making decisions, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific situation and goals.
