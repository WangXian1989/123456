When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs also allow pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs use post-tax contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on dividends and capital gains, often at a higher rate than retirement accounts.

2. **Maximize Employer Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

3. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Consider maxing out contributions to your IRA (both Traditional and Roth, if eligible) for their tax benefits.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you’re younger and have time until retirement, you might lean more towards aggressive investments in taxable accounts that can benefit from long-term capital gains, while still prioritizing retirement accounts for tax efficiency.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Generally, stocks are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts due to their growth potential and the benefits of tax-free growth. Bonds, which are less volatile and provide income, might be better in taxable accounts to avoid higher tax liabilities.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation based on performance and your changing risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**:
   - Consider consulting a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

By carefully considering these factors and strategically distributing your investments, you can optimize your portfolio for growth and tax efficiency.
