Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money". Depending on the plan's investment choices and fees, you may want to prioritize your contributions here, especially if you are in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing out contributions here for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're seeking traditional tax deductions, a Traditional IRA could be beneficial as well.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These are beneficial for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement. You can hold investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

**Recommended Approach**:
- Start with your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
- Max out an IRA if possible.
- Use taxable accounts for investments needed before retirement and to take advantage of long-term capital gains rates.

### Factors to Consider:
- **Time Horizon**: Longer horizons may favor tax-advantaged accounts.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Allocate investments accordingly across all accounts.
- **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of how distributions affect your tax bracket.

Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation is also wise.
