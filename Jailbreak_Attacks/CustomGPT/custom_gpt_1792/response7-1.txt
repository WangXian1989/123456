Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, prioritize contributions to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and are managing high-interest debt before maximizing investments.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you can contribute beyond your tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable brokerage accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Invest Based on Goals**: Align your investments within each account with your goals. Short-term goals might go in safer investments, while long-term goals can take on more risk.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically based on performance and changing goals.

Ultimately, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor this approach to your specific situation.
