I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment. However, here are some common treatment options that may be considered for liver issues:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet Modification**: Eating a balanced diet, low in fat and sugar, can aid liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving or maintaining a healthy weight can reduce liver strain.

2. **Medications**:
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis, medications can help manage the infection.
   - **Fat-soluble Vitamins**: These may be prescribed if you have liver disease affecting nutrient absorption.

3. **Surgery**:
   - **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases of liver failure, a transplant may be necessary.

Always follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.
