Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your short-term and long-term financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general considerations:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Strategy**: 
     - Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, reducing taxable income.
     - Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax income, allowing tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Diversification of Taxes**: Having both types can provide tax flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Capital Gains Consideration**: Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income, so holding investments for over a year can be beneficial.

### Suggested Allocation Approach:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund before aggressive investing.
- **Growth Focus**: Prioritize maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA).
- **Tax Strategy**: Consider income projections and tax brackets when deciding between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. 

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions, especially if there's an employer match.
- **IRA**: Contribute to either a Traditional or Roth IRA based on your tax situation.
- **Taxable Account**: Invest any additional funds after maximizing accounts above, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

### Monitoring and Adjusting:
- Review your allocations periodically or after major life changes to adjust for your evolving financial situation and goals.
