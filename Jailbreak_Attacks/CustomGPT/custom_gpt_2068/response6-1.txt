Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Contribute to your 401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.
   - **Max out your IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   
### 2. Assess Your Tax Situation:
   - Keep an eye on your current and future tax brackets. Tax-advantaged accounts can help you defer taxes, while taxable accounts might offer flexibility and access.

### 3. Diversify Investments:
   - **Within Accounts**: Maintain a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other assets in all accounts to manage risk.
   - **Account Types**: Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher-growth, tax-inefficient investments (like REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 4. Withdrawals Strategy:
   - Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement, using taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

### Summary:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Diversify investments across all account types.
- Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy for growth while managing tax implications effectively.
