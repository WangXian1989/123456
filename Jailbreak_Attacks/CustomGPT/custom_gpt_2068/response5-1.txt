Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (or Roth IRA) since they offer great tax benefits.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement. Keep in mind that capital gains and dividends are subject to taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify investments across accounts, tailoring them based on tax implications (e.g., place more tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Reassess your distribution annually to align with your changing financial situation and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to meet the employer match, then contribute enough to utilize the tax deduction.
- **IRA**: Max out if eligible, prioritizing Roth for tax-free growth if you qualify.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for additional savings or short-term goals, focusing on tax-efficient funds.

Always consider your unique situation, and adjust as needed!
