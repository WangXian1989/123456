Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if offered. It's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments across stocks, bonds, and other assets, based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

4. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Any additional investments can go into taxable accounts. These are useful for short-term goals or to maintain liquidity.

5. **Monitor and Adjust**: Review your allocations regularly and make adjustments based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.

6. **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Be mindful of how investments are taxed in taxable accounts, prioritizing tax-efficient funds when possible.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best suits your individual needs.
