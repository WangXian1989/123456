Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA contributions (Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and goals) after your 401(k) match. This can provide tax-free growth (Roth) or tax-deferred growth (Traditional).

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower capital gains or dividends, or if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investment choices across all accounts reflect your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Monitor and Rebalance**: Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to align with your investment strategy.

6. **Consider Withdrawals**: Plan withdrawals by considering which account will provide the best tax outcome when you retire.
