To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Accounts**:  
   - **401(k)**: Typically offers pre-tax contributions, often with employer matching. It has higher contribution limits compared to IRAs but comes with potential penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (traditional IRAs have tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth). Contribution limits are generally lower than 401(k)s.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Offer flexibility with no contribution limits and easier access to funds but are subject to capital gains taxes on investments.

2. **Establish Financial Goals**:  
   Determine your short-term and long-term financial goals. This will help you decide how much liquidity you need and how aggressively you want to invest.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:  
   - Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to maximize tax savings. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - If you're eligible, consider using a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

4. **Asset Allocation**:  
   Based on your risk tolerance and time horizon, decide how to allocate investments across accounts. Generally, it may be beneficial to hold more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, while using taxable accounts for more stable investments (like bonds) to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Regularly Rebalance**:  
   Periodic rebalancing is vital to maintain your intended asset allocation across all accounts as market conditions change.

6. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:  
   Given the complexities of tax laws and investment strategies, consulting a financial advisor can help tailor an approach that aligns with your specific circumstances and goals.

By following these steps and continually reassessing your strategy, you can optimize how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively.
