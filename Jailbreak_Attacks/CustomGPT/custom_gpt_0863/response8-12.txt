I am here to help with conflict resolution and provide neutral advice, but I cannot offer medical advice or treatment options for health issues. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for medical concerns. They can provide you with the best treatment options and guidance for your specific condition. Remember to prioritize your health and seek professional support for medical issues.
