To provide effective conflict resolution assistance, I need to clarify that your question relates more to financial planning rather than to a specific conflict scenario. However, if you're experiencing a conflict regarding financial decisions, I would be happy to help you identify the underlying issues and provide constructive feedback. 

Here are some steps we can take to analyze your situation:

1. **Understanding Positions**: Share your current investment goals, risk tolerance, and any particular concerns you have regarding your financial distributions.

2. **Identifying Conflict Points**: Are there differing opinions or strategies you're considering? For instance, do you have conflicting advice from financial advisors or personal beliefs about investing?

3. **Communication**: If there is a party involved (like a partner or advisor) with whom you're having a disagreement, please outline that dynamic.

4. **Proposing Solutions**: Once the key points are established, I can propose balanced strategies for optimizing your allocation among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.

Please provide me with more context or clarify any conflicts related to your financial distribution so I can assist you appropriately.
