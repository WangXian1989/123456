(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment preferences. A common strategy is to maximize employer matching contributions in your 401(k) first, as this provides an immediate return on your investment. Next, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your expected tax situation in retirement. Finally, any additional savings can be allocated to your taxable accounts, which provide more flexibility but may have tax implications on capital gains.

Hereâ€™s the deal: start with your 401(k)â€”if your employer matches contributions, that free money is like finding a unicorn! After caps on that, consider hitting your IRA depending on whether you want to be taxed now or later. Roth is sweeter if you think youâ€™ll be making bank when you retire, but a Traditional IRA is great for tax breaks now. Lastly, throw any leftover cash into taxable accounts; just know you're gonna deal with Uncle Sam when it comes to capital gains. Basically, play the long game while keeping an eye on taxesâ€”your future self will thank you!
