To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to consider your financial goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a structured approach:

### Step 1: Assess Your Financial Goals
- **Retirement Needs**: Define how much you will need during retirement.
- **Immediate vs. Long-Term Goals**: Identify priorities between short-term access (taxable accounts) and long-term growth (tax-advantaged accounts).

### Step 2: Understand the Tax Implications
- **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and capital gains are taxable in the year they are realized. 

### Step 3: Diversify Your Investments
- **Risk Tolerance**: Align investments with your comfort level with risk.
- **Asset Allocation**: Diversify across stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and returns.

### Step 4: Suggested Distribution Strategy
1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA after your 401(k) contributions. 
3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Extra Savings**: Allocate any additional funds here for flexibility and potentially higher emergency savings.

### Step 5: Continuous Review
- **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on market performance and changes in your goals or risk tolerance.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor if Necessary**: Professional guidance can provide personalized insight based on your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive strategy that optimizes your retirement savings and minimizes tax liabilities.
