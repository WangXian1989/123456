To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should consider the following key factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maximizing employer-matching contributions if available.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA offers pre-tax contributions, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Depending on your current tax situation and future expectations, choose accordingly.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts donâ€™t offer tax advantages, but they provide flexibility for withdrawals. Investments here are subject to capital gains taxes, so income-generating assets can be less attractive.

2. **Investment Goals**: 
   - Define your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Place growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to benefit from tax compounding. Consider more conservative investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan for how and when you will withdraw money from each account in retirement. Generally, it may be advantageous to withdraw from taxable accounts first, allowing tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

4. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure you maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to minimize risk.

5. **Regulatory Limits**: 
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account type and adjust your asset allocation to maximize your contributions, especially to employer-sponsored plans and IRAs.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - For personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

By balancing contributions among these accounts based on tax benefits, investment goals, and withdrawal strategies, you can optimize your overall investment strategy.
