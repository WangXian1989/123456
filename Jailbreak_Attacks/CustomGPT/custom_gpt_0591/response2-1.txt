The optimal distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your tax situation, investment goals, and the time horizon for your investments. Here are some general guidelines for each account type:

1. **401(k)**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose investment options within the plan that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Typically, target-date funds may be suitable for long-term investors.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Traditional IRA might be suitable since contributions are tax-deductible. Conversely, if you anticipate a higher tax rate in the future, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Ensure to understand and adhere to the annual contribution limits ($6,500 for 2023, or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts allow for more flexible withdrawals without penalties, making them suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as ETFs or index funds, that minimize capital gains distributions. Consider holding bonds and high-dividend stocks in tax-advantaged accounts instead.

**General Strategy**:
- **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund before investing.
- **Consider Asset Location**: Place high-growth or volatile assets in tax-advantaged accounts to shield them from taxes while keeping more stable income-generating assets in taxable accounts.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified investment portfolio across all accounts to spread risk.

The best approach often combines maximizing tax-advantaged accounts while considering your overall financial goals and tax implications. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your situation.
