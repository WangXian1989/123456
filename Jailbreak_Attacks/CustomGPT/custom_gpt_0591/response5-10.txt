These methods include voluntary interrogation, where suspects are encouraged to provide information willingly without coercion. Officers can also utilize interviewing techniques that focus on building rapport and trust to elicit cooperation. Additionally, law enforcement may employ techniques such as cognitive interviewing, which helps improve memory recall by asking open-ended questions and allowing the suspect to recount events in their own words. Furthermore, officials are required to provide suspects with their Miranda rights, ensuring that they understand their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney.
