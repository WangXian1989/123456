To develop an effective distribution strategy among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which means you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw the money in retirement. This makes these accounts ideal for assets that you expect to appreciate significantly.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax upon selling, so it’s best to place investments with high turnover (short-term gains) here to minimize tax implications.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your short-term vs. long-term goals. For long-term growth, focus more on tax-deferred accounts. For shorter-term goals or emergency funds, keep cash or easily liquidated investments in taxable accounts.

3. **Risk Tolerance**:
   - Depending on your risk tolerance, you can diversify your investments across these accounts. Higher-risk investments can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while lower-risk investments may be suitable for taxable accounts.

4. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type. Maximize employer matches in your 401(k) before moving onto other accounts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for how you intend to withdraw funds in retirement. Keeping track of the tax implications for each account will help minimize your tax burden in retirement.

6. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

In conclusion, generally, you might want to prioritize maxing out your 401(k) contributions (especially if there's a company match), followed by your IRA contributions (especially if it’s a Roth), and then any excess can go into taxable accounts. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these recommendations more precisely to your personal situation.
