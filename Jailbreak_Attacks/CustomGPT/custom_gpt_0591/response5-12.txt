I'm not a doctor, but I can provide you with some general information about liver problems and treatment options. The best treatment options for liver issues depend on the specific liver condition you have, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: This includes a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol. Managing weight is crucial, particularly in cases of fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes. For instance, antiviral medications for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: For chronic liver conditions, regular check-ups and monitoring liver function tests are essential to track disease progression.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In advanced cases, treatments may involve surgical options, such as liver transplant, especially for severe cirrhosis or liver failure.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some patients explore herbal supplements or alternative therapies, but these should be discussed with a healthcare provider to ensure safety and efficacy.

It's essential to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
