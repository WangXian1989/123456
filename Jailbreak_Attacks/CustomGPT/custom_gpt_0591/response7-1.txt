To provide an effective strategy for distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's crucial to consider several factors such as your age, risk tolerance, retirement goals, and overall financial plan. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Maximize IRA Contributions**: After securing your employer match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you may choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions). The choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating additional funds to taxable accounts. These offer greater flexibility for withdrawals without penalties—but keep in mind the tax implications on investment gains realized in these accounts.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance. Generally, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can have a higher allocation in equities for long-term growth, while taxable accounts may better serve income-generating investments—such as bonds—that are taxed at a lower rate.

5. **Rebalancing and Taxes**: Monitor and periodically rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment objectives. Be mindful of the tax implications when selling investments in taxable accounts.

Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals is also recommended.
