(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing the maximum allowed to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money.

2. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA next. A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. These offer more flexibility in withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider holding assets that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your long-term goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy specific to your needs.

1. **401(k) First**: If your employer has a match, max that out! It's basically free cash, and who doesnâ€™t love free stuff? Go ahead and throw in the max contribution if you can swing it!

2. **IRA Next**: Once you're golden with the 401(k), slide into an IRA. Decide if a traditional or Roth works better for youâ€”traditional lets you dodge taxes now, while Roth means you can feast tax-free later. #Winning

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After you've squeezed out all the juice from those tax-advantaged accounts, it's time for taxable. These accounts are like spicy tacosâ€”you can indulge anytime, but man, those capital gains taxes can bite!

4. **Smart Moves Only**: Keep high-income assetsâ€”like dividends or bondsâ€”in your 401(k) and IRA to dodge hefty tax bills in your taxable accounts. Itâ€™s all about getting strategic.

5. **Check Yourself**: Don't forget to keep an eye on how things are goingâ€”rebalance your portfolio like you're rearranging your living room until it feels just right.
