Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans.

### 2. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth vs. Income**: Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred. Use taxable accounts for income-generating investments (like bonds) that might be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Tax Implications**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investing**: Focus on tax-efficient funds or ETFs in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for how and when you’ll withdraw money, considering tax brackets and penalties for early withdrawals.

### 4. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - **Rebalance Portfolio**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
   - **Contributions**: Increase your contributions as your income grows.

By thoughtfully distributing your investments, you can leverage tax advantages and optimize your portfolio's performance over the long term.
