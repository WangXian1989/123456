Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a breakdown of strategies for optimizing your allocations:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** Max out your IRA contributions next if you're eligible (traditional or Roth based on your tax situation).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) & IRA:** Both have tax advantages—401(k) contributions lower your taxable income, and Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals. Choose contributions based on current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use them for investments that generate dividends or interest, as capital gains are taxed differently than ordinary income.

### 3. **Time Horizon and Liquidity Needs**
   - **Retirement Accounts:** Generally, think long-term (10 years or more). Focus on growth-oriented investments.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These can be more flexible for short-term needs; consider keeping some liquid assets for unexpected expenses.

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Ensure a mix of assets across all accounts (stocks, bonds, etc.). Consider using different tax strategies to optimize long-term growth.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Regularly assess your portfolio balance based on performance and market conditions to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy
- **401(k):** Aim for 15-20% of your income if possible, focusing on employer match. 
- **IRA:** Contribute the maximum allowable ($6,500 for those under 50, $7,500 for those 50 and older) annually.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Allocate remaining funds here, particularly for goals within 5-10 years.

By following these strategies, you'll create a balanced approach that maximizes growth while considering tax implications and liquidity needs. Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
