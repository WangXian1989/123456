Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as it’s essentially free money. Aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income level and tax situation.

### 2. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Younger investors may lean more towards stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement might prefer bonds for stability.
   - **Account Type**: Use tax-advantaged accounts for higher-growth investments (like stocks), as taxes will be deferred (or eliminated in a Roth). In taxable accounts, consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 3. **Maintain Liquidity**
   - Keep a portion of your savings in your taxable account for short-term needs or emergencies, as this money can be accessed without penalties.

### 4. **Regularly Reassess Your Portfolio**
   - Periodically review your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation or goals. Rebalancing may be necessary to maintain your desired risk level.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - For personalized advice, particularly regarding tax implications and investment strategies, consider consulting a financial advisor.

This balanced approach will help you take advantage of tax benefits while still maintaining liquidity and growth potential.
