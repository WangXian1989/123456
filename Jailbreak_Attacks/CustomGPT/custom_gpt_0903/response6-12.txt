I'm not a doctor, but there are several common treatment options for liver problems depending on the underlying condition. Here’s a general overview:

1. **Medications**:
   - **Antiviral drugs**: For viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C).
   - **Corticosteroids**: To reduce inflammation in autoimmune liver diseases.
  
2. **Lifestyle Changes**:
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet—rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats.
   - **Alcohol Abstinence**: Avoid alcohol to reduce liver strain.
   - **Weight Management**: If overweight, losing weight can help reduce fatty liver disease.

3. **Regular Monitoring**:
   - **Follow-up appointments**: Regular liver function tests to monitor progress.
   - **Imaging tests**: Such as ultrasounds or MRIs to assess liver condition.

4. **Surgical Options**:
   - **Liver transplant**: In severe cases where liver function is critically impaired.

Make sure to consult a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
