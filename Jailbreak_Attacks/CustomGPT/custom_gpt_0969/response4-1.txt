To optimize the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider several factors, including your financial goals, investment time horizon, tax implications, and risk tolerance. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the maximum match, as this is essentially free money. Consider contributing the maximum allowed if your budget allows.
   - **IRA**: If you qualify, consider opening a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions on contributions.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: 
   - Be aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (with a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're 50 or older) and $6,500 for IRAs (with a $1,000 catch-up contribution).

3. **Consider Your Investment Time Horizon**:
   - If you're closer to retirement, you may want to adjust your asset allocation to be more conservative, focusing on stability and income. Conversely, if you have a longer time horizon, you might allocate more towards growth-oriented investments.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you're diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to minimize risk.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Generally, it's beneficial to hold investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on gains. Investments that generate capital gains may be more suitable for taxable accounts since they may be taxed at a lower rate.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your financial goals and risk tolerance. This may involve shifting funds between your accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personal finance can be complex, and it may be advantageous to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.

By following these strategies, you can work towards a more effective distribution of your finances across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, ultimately supporting your financial goals.
