To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement. Maximize employer matching contributions here.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prefer Roth contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are subject to capital gains tax, but they offer flexibility in accessing funds. Prioritize investments with favorable tax treatment, like long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.

2. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: 
   - Allocate funds based on your investment horizon. More aggressive investments may be suitable for longer timelines in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be in taxable accounts to manage taxes more efficiently.
   - Adjust your asset allocation according to your risk tolerance and goals for retirement, education, or other future expenses.

3. **Diversification**: 
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. Diversification helps mitigate risk while aiming for growth.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: 
   - Plan how and when to withdraw funds from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes, using withdrawals from taxable accounts first to allow more tax-deferred growth in 401(k)s and IRAs.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Monitor and adjust your portfolio as your situation changes or as market conditions fluctuate, ensuring that your allocations remain aligned with your goals.

By considering these factors, you can create a tailored distribution strategy that maximizes growth and minimizes tax liabilities across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
