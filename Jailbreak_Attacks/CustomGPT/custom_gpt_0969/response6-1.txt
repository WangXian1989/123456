When considering how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s important to take into account several factors such as your retirement goals, tax implications, risk tolerance, and investment options. Here is a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute at least enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount to your traditional or Roth IRA, based on your eligibility, to benefit from tax-free growth or tax deductions.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Investments grow tax-deferred, meaning you won’t pay taxes until you withdraw funds in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends and capital gains, so consider keeping investments that generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts where growth can compound without immediate tax consequences.
   - **Income Generation**: Consider holding income-generating investments in taxable accounts, where you can manage the tax liabilities more effectively.

4. **Diversification and Risk Assessment**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, taking into account your risk tolerance. Adjust asset allocation based on time horizon and risk preferences.

5. **Periodic Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your personal financial situation to ensure you stay on track towards your financial goals.
