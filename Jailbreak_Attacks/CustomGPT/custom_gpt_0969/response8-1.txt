The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your financial situation, investment goals, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guideline to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but you will pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Contribution limits for 2023 are up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, while contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Taxable accounts**: These do not offer tax advantages but allow for more flexibility with withdrawals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held for more than a year.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before aggressively investing in retirement accounts, ensure that you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. This ensures you have liquidity for unexpected events.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Depending on your age, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, you may want to consider a mix of stocks and bonds across all your accounts. Younger investors may benefit from a higher allocation to stocks for growth, while those approaching retirement may want to increase the bond allocation for stability.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out your retirement account contributions and emergency fund, consider investing in a taxable account for additional growth potential. This offers flexibility as you won't face penalties for early withdrawals like you might with retirement accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio and contributions based on market performance, personal financial changes, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It's often valuable to get personalized advice from a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored strategy balancing your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution among your accounts will vary based on personal circumstances, so it’s essential to continually assess your financial goals and adjust your strategy as necessary.
