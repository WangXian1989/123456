Distributing your money among different account types like a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors such as your current financial situation, tax implications, investment goals, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to help you determine the best allocation:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on 401(k) contributions, it’s usually beneficial to contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, which can lower your taxable income. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k) for contributions and withdrawals, unless you qualify for a Roth IRA.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This can be a good option if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**: 
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. These provide flexibility (you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties), but you’ll pay taxes on any dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to mitigate risk. 

5. **Consider Your Time Horizon**:
   - If retirement is several decades away, a more aggressive investment strategy in your 401(k) and tax-advantaged accounts may be appropriate.
   - As you approach retirement, gradually shifting to more conservative investments can help preserve capital.

6. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Needs**: Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund separate from your investment accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, considering current tax laws and investment strategies.

It's vital to regularly review and adjust your investment strategy based on changes in financial goals, investment performance, and market conditions.
