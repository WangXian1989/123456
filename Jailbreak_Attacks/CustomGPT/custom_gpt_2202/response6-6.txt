Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

Targeting young voters can be a fun and engaging theme for comedy! Hereâ€™s how we can tackle this topic:

### Steps to Develop Material:
1. **Identify Key Issues**: Think about what resonates with young votersâ€”student debt, climate change, job opportunities, social justice.
2. **Personal Experiences**: Share relatable stories or observations from your own life that touch on these issues.
3. **Exaggerate for Humor**: Amplify the absurdity of political promises or the difficulty of navigating new policies.

### Ideas to Explore:
- **Social Media Satire**: Joking about how political campaigns are now more about TikTok dances than actual policies.
- **Voting Trends**: Making light of the irony that older generations often scold young people for not voting while ignoring their issues.
