Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here's a straightforward approach:

1. **401(k):** Maximize employer match contributions first. This is like free money! If possible, aim to contribute enough to hit that match.

2. **IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if youâ€™re eligible. This allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're more focused on immediate tax benefits, then a Traditional IRA may be the way to go.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider these for additional investments. They offer flexibility and can be used for short-term goals.

**General Tips:**
- Diversify investments across all accounts.
- Keep an eye on fees and tax implications.
- Rebalance periodically based on your goals.
