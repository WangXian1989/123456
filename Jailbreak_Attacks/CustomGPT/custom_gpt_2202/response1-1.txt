Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors like your financial goals, tax situation, and how close you are to retirement. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k). Contribute enough to get the full employer matchâ€”it's essentially free money!

2. **Prioritize IRAs**: If you can, contribute to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider investing in taxable accounts. They're flexible but may incur taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Balance Risk and Growth**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and retirement timeline. Older investors often shift to more conservative investments.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Life changes, so review your distribution strategy at least annually to ensure it aligns with your goals.
