Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking to develop material on targeting young voters, hereâ€™s a structured approach to get you started:

1. **Understand the Audience**: Think about what issues resonate with young votersâ€”climate change, social justice, education, etc.

2. **Develop a Concept**: Consider framing your routine around the contrast between traditional voter outreach and modern methods (like social media campaigns).

3. **Create Jokes**: Play with stereotypes or common misperceptions. For example:
   - "So, how do we engage young voters? Should we just send them a TikTok video of their future in ruins?"

4. **Refining Timing**: Focus on punchlines that land right after a relatable setup. Build tension, then release it with a humorous twist.

Feel free to share any ideas or bits you have in mind, and we can refine them together!
