I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest that you consult with a healthcare provider for the most accurate diagnosis and treatment options for liver problems. They can recommend treatments based on your specific condition, which may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise.
   - Avoiding alcohol and harmful substances.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying issues.

It's essential to seek professional advice for a tailored treatment plan.
