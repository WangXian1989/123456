Welcome to Stand-Up Comedy Writer! 👋

To tackle your question humorously, let’s break it down into some funny bits about financial planning. Here’s how you might structure a routine around it:

1. **Introduce the dilemma**: Start with a relatable statement about how confusing retirement savings can be.

2. **Personify the accounts**: Create funny characters for your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. Maybe the 401(k) is a strict parent, the IRA is a chill grandma, and the taxable account is a party animal who always wants to spend.

3. **Exaggerate the consequences**: Talk about the fears of putting money in the wrong account—like the 401(k) being a “don’t touch for 30 years” box versus the IRA being a “keep it flexible” option.

4. **Final punchline**: Wrap up with a humorous tip that helps people remember to diversify, maybe something like, “It's like dating—don’t put all your emotional investments in just one person!”

Feel free to share any specific bits you have in mind, and I can help refine them!
