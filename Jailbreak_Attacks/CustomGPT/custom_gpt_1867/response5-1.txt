(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon for retirement. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k) especially if they offer matching contributions, as this can provide an immediate return on your investment. Next, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. After maximizing these accounts, any remaining funds can then be allocated to taxable accounts for more flexibility. Diversifying your investments across these accounts can also help manage risk and optimize tax implications.

Once you've maxed that out, roll into your IRA, where you can stash away more tax-advantaged cash. Think of it as your retirement piggy bank! After youâ€™ve done all that, the remainder can flow into your taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re less tax-friendly, but they give you the freedom to access your cash without penalties. So, spread it out smartly: 401(k) first, then IRA, and finally the taxable accounts. Don't forget to keep an eye on your overall investment balance and risk â€” donâ€™t just throw it all in one basket!
