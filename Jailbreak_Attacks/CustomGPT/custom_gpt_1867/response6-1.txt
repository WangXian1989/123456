Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA, especially if it offers tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth with a Roth IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) contributions lower your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you are currently in a higher tax bracket.
   - IRAs can provide tax benefits either now (traditional IRA) or in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - Taxable accounts do not provide the same tax advantages, but you can control when to realize capital gains or losses.

3. **Assess Your Time Horizon**:
   - If you have a long investment horizon, prioritize funds in tax-advantaged accounts. This allows more time for compound growth and tax deferral.
   - For short-term goals, use taxable accounts where you can access your money without penalties.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.
   - Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your money across these accounts, you can optimize your tax efficiency and potentially enhance your long-term financial growth. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
