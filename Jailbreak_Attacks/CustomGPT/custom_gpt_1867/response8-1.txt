The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation and goals. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Then, consider fully funding your IRA (either traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).

2. **Consider Tax Implications**: Withdrawals from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs are taxed as ordinary income, while qualified withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax-free. Taxable accounts may be taxed on dividends and capital gains, so strategizing the timing of withdrawals can minimize taxes.

3. **Age and Time Horizon**: If you're younger and have a longer investment horizon, it may make sense to lean more heavily on the accounts that offer tax-free growth (like Roth IRAs). As you near retirement, you might want to shift to ensure liquidity while considering tax implications.

4. **Investment Choices**: Consider the type of investments you hold in each account. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds) may be better suited for taxable accounts, while less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) might be better in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your financial needs and market conditions change over time, so regularly reviewing your asset allocation can help you adjust contributions as needed.

In summary, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, consider tax implications when withdrawing, align investments with account types, and regularly review your strategy to meet your financial goals.
