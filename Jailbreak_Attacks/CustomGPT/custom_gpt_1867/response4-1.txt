To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions up to the match, consider contributing to an IRA. Decide between a Traditional IRA (which may provide tax deductions) and a Roth IRA (which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement). 

3. **Consider Tax Implications**: Distributions from a 401(k) and Traditional IRA are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. In contrast, withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if conditions are met. Taxable accounts allow for capital gains treatment, which may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund in a savings account to cover unexpected expenses.

5. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Within each account type, focus on diversifying your investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Periodically**: Regularly evaluate and adjust your investment allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

Remember, consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor these strategies to your specific situation and goals.
