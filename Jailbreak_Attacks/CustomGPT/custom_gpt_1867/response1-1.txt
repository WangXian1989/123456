The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching:** If your 401(k) offers an employer match, try to contribute enough to take full advantage of that benefit first. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Roth or Traditional, depending on your tax situation and retirement goals). IRAs often offer more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** If you have high-interest debt (like credit cards), consider paying that off before contributing too much to retirement accounts. The interest on debt can outweigh investment gains.

4. **Continue with the 401(k):** Once youâ€™re on track with your IRA contributions, continue to contribute to your 401(k), especially if you're aiming to maximize your retirement savings.

5. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** If you've maxed out your retirement accounts and want additional savings, consider taxable investment accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices.

6. **Adjust Based on Life Changes:** Your distribution strategy may change with life circumstances (like marriage, buying a home, or job changes). Regularly reassess your strategy.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique circumstances.
