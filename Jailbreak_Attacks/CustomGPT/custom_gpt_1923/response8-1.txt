To effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to take full advantage of that match before directing funds elsewhere.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Allocate funds to tax-advantaged accounts first. Max out your traditional or Roth IRA contributions if eligible (up to the annual limits), as these accounts offer tax benefits.

3. **Balance Contributions**: Once you've maximized tax-advantaged accounts, distribute additional funds to your 401(k), especially if it offers a variety of investment options and low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for short-term goals or greater liquidity. Keep in mind that investments here may be subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments across all accounts. Consider asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly check and rebalance your portfolios to ensure you maintain your desired allocation across all accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to align your investment strategy with your financial goals.

These strategies can help optimize your overall investment returns while managing tax implications.
