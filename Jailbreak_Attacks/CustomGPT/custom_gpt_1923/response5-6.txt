Think TikTok dances, catchy memes, and videos that feel more like entertainment than a political ad. Young folks value authenticity, so drop the corporate jargon and just be real. Highlight issues that hit close to homeâ€”like the student loan crisis and climate changeâ€”and show how youâ€™re on their side. And for goodness' sake, involve them in the conversation! Host live Q&As, pop-up events, or fun campaigns that they can really vibe with. Make politics less boring and more about what they care aboutâ€”got it?
