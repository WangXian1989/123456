Allocating your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to max out your contributions.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. 

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Place investments expected to generate high taxable income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that have lower expected turnover and long-term capital gains, which can be taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Utilize different asset classes to balance risk and growth. Allocate higher-risk investments in accounts that offer tax advantages since they can benefit the most from tax-deferral or exemption.
   - Ensure you don’t over-concentrate in one account type — maintain a well-rounded portfolio across all accounts.

4. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:**
   - Reassess your allocation periodically (at least annually) to stay aligned with your financial goals and market changes.
   - Pay attention to contribution limits and tax law changes that might affect your strategy.

5. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - If you're nearing retirement, it’s wise to strategize on how to withdraw funds from each account type to minimize taxes during retirement.

Remember that individual situations vary greatly, so it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
