Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a variety of factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy for balancing your investments:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing as much as possible to your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly impact your long-term growth. 
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match before allocating additional funds elsewhere.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Consider your current versus expected future tax rates to decide which is better for you.

2. **Evaluate Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account:
   - For 2023, the limit for 401(k) contributions is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - For IRAs, the contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

3. **Consider Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance**: If you have short-term goals (like buying a house), you may want to keep money in taxable accounts since they offer more liquidity. For long-term retirement goals, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing more tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds that generate high capital gains) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance and Adjust**: Regularly review and adjust the distribution as your circumstances change, including changes in income, investment performance, or life events (like marriage, having children, or nearing retirement).

A financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation and help optimize your distribution strategy.
