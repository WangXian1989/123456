When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax implications. Hereâ€™s a basic strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get that full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contributions to IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide a tax deduction now.

3. **401(k) Contributions:** After maximizing your employer match and contributing to your IRA, further fund your 401(k). These accounts benefit from tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts:** If you still have money left to invest after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting it into a taxable brokerage account. This allows for more flexibility, but keep an eye on capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments across accounts based on your overall risk tolerance and investment strategy. Generally, it's recommended to keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired level of risk and to take advantage of market conditions.

Always consider speaking to a financial advisor to tailor the strategy to your specific situation.
