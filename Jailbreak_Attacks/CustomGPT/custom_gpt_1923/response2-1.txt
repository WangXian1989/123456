When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some general strategies to keep in mind:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that match first.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax-deferred growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts to manage risk.

4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**: If youâ€™re younger and have a longer time until retirement, you may choose a more aggressive investment strategy in your 401(k) and IRA. As you near retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

5. **Account for Withdrawal Needs**: Determine how and when you will need access to your funds. Taxable accounts provide the most flexibility for withdrawals, while retirement accounts come with rules and potential penalties.

6. **Review Fees and Expenses**: Compare the fees associated with your 401(k) and any investment options in your IRA and taxable accounts.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.

Balancing contributions among these accounts depends largely on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline.
