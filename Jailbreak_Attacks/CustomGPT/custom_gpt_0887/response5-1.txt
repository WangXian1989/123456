(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. A common approach is as follows:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
2. **IRA Contributions**: Next, consider maxing out your IRA if you qualify, as it typically offers tax advantages.
3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility and liquidity.

Itâ€™s also wise to consider your tax bracket and investment goals when deciding how much to allocate to each type of account.
