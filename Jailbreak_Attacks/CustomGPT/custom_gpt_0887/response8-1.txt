When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to take several factors into account, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of that. It's essentially "free money."

2. **Fund an IRA**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), either traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once you’ve funded your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the maximum allowable limit. Keep an eye on fees and investment options available in your plan.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is typically less advantageous for retirement savings but can provide flexibility and access to funds.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Inside each account, maintain a diversified asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For instance, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts, since they'll compound tax-free.

7. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your distribution strategy as your financial situation, goals, and market conditions change.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
