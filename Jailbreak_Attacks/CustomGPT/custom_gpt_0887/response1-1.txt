To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money that you don’t want to leave on the table.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to your IRA and 401(k) first, as these accounts offer tax benefits, whether through tax-deferred growth (401(k) and Traditional IRA) or tax-free growth (Roth IRA).

3. **Balance Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim for the maximum annual contribution limit (e.g., $22,500 in 2023, or $30,000 if you’re over 50).
   - **IRA**: Contribute to an IRA (up to $6,500, or $7,500 if over 50) if eligible. Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if your income permits.

4. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. Focus on investments that generate qualified dividends and long-term capital gains to minimize tax impacts.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Stocks typically offer higher growth potential, while bonds provide stability.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocations to ensure they still align with your goals and adjust as needed, especially as market conditions change.

7. **Plan for Withdrawals**: Think ahead about tax implications for withdrawals. For instance, withdrawing from a taxable account may be more tax-efficient in certain cases.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances and goals.
