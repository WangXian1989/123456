The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, make sure to contribute enough to at least get the full match. This is essentially free money and can significantly boost your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Treatment**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (including earnings) are tax-free in retirement if certain conditions are met.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest, dividends, and short-term capital gains are taxed annually, while long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.

3. **Prioritize Savings**: Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts first:
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowed to your 401(k) and IRAs (both traditional and Roth) if you can afford it.
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings once you've reached the contribution limits for tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments within these accounts based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, consider having a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash, but keep in mind that growth-oriented investments are often more suitable for tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-deferred growth.

5. **Adjust for Withdrawals**: As you get closer to retirement, consider shifting to more conservative investments, especially in your taxable accounts where capital gains can incur taxes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and investment strategies, it may be beneficial to work with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy.

Always evaluate your specific financial situation and goals to determine the best approach for you.
