The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of expenses.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money. Aim to maximize contributions after getting the match.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement), depending on your tax situation and expected future tax rates.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: If you’re already maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, or if you need liquidity or flexibility, consider investing in taxable accounts. Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize tax implications.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Determine your ideal asset allocation (stocks vs. bonds) and then distribute this allocation across your accounts. Keep in mind the tax efficiency of each account type; for example, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts when possible.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation, making adjustments as needed.

7. **Consider Future Needs**: Think about when you’ll need access to your money. If you need funds sooner, allocate more to taxable accounts. For long-term growth, prioritize retirement accounts.
