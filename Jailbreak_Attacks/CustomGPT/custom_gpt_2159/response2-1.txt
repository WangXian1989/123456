Dividing your investments among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors like your financial goals, time horizon, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's effectively free money.

2. **Fund IRAs**: Contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA based on your income and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Additional 401(k) Contributions**: If you've maxed out your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals or if you want more liquidity. Invest in tax-efficient funds or stocks to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Consider diversifying your investments according to your risk tolerance. Generally, equities work well in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term growth potential, while bonds may be better suited for taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on market performance and changes in your financial situation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique circumstances.
