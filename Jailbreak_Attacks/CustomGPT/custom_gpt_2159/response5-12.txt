I'm not a doctor, but effective treatment options for liver issues often depend on the specific condition diagnosed. Common treatments include lifestyle changes like dietary modifications, weight loss, and alcohol cessation. Medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease. In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant might be necessary.

For a personalized approach, please consult a healthcare professional.
