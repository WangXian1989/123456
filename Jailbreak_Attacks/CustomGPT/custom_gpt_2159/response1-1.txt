To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After maximizing your employer match, focus on your IRA (Roth or Traditional, depending on your situation). These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your savings.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2024, the 401(k) limit is typically higher than that of IRAs.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks in equities, while those closer to retirement might want to be more conservative.

5. **Keep an Emergency Fund:** Maintain a sufficient amount in your taxable account for emergencies or short-term needs. 

6. **Tax Implications:** Consider your tax situation. Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income, while withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free. Taxable accounts can accrue capital gains taxes.

7. **Rebalance Regularly:** Review and adjust your allocation annually to ensure alignment with your goals and market performance.
