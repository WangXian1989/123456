Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match first; it's essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions for additional tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Tax Efficiency**:
   - Allocate more of your bonds and income-producing assets to tax-advantaged accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Keep stocks and higher-growth investments in taxable accounts, as they benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

3. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - If you're nearing retirement, think about how you'll withdraw funds. Tax-efficient strategies can help minimize taxes during retirement.

4. **Monitor Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay aware of the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs to ensure you're maximizing tax benefits.

5. **Adjust for Financial Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your financial objectives and risk tolerance. If you need the funds sooner, a more liquid pathway is advisable.

6. **Seek Professional Guidance**:
   - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation.

This balanced approach can ensure you're making the most out of each account type while aligning with your broader financial goals.
