I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. Treatment options for liver problems vary depending on the specific condition. Common approaches include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Improving diet, exercising, and reducing alcohol intake can significantly help liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the liver condition (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), medications may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, liver transplant may be an option.

It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan. Have you discussed your symptoms with a doctor yet?
