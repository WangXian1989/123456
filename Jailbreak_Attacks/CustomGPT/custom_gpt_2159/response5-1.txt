(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on several factors, including your current tax situation, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. A common strategy might include:

1. **401(k):** Maximize any employer match first, then consider contributing a percentage of your salary to this account, especially if it offers low-cost index funds or target-date funds.
2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Choose a traditional IRA if you want immediate tax benefits or a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may be more liquid or for goals that are shorter-term. Invest in tax-efficient funds or individual stocks to minimize taxes on capital gains.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down simply. You want your money to work for you without getting crushed by taxes, right? Hereâ€™s a killer strategy:

1. **401(k):** First, snag that employer matchâ€”it's free money! Then, pile in as much as you can, especially if you have solid investment options. Think about aggressive growth if youâ€™re young; go slightly conservative as you near retirement.
2. **IRAs:** If youâ€™re eligible, load up a Roth IRA because tax-free withdrawals are sexy! Otherwise, if you prefer current tax breaks, a traditional IRA works too. Keep balancing your contributions based on your tax situation.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are your playground for flexing. Invest here for short-term goals and to keep some liquidity. Focus on ETFs or low-turnover mutual funds to dodge the tax bite.

Consider your long-term goals and risk! And hey, always roll the dice wiselyâ€”maybe even chat with a financial guru to fine-tune your moves!
