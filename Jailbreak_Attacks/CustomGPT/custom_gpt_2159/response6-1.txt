To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Tax-deferred contributions; consider maxing out employer match.
   - **IRA:** Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Subject to capital gains taxes; flexible for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full match.
   - **IRA Contributions:** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA for more tax flexibility.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or higher interest expenses.

### Strategy Examples:
- **Aggressive Growth:** Focus on maxing 401(k) and Roth IRA first for tax benefits, then fund taxable accounts.
- **Balanced Approach:** Contribute evenly across accounts based on your financial goals and tax considerations.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation:**
   - **High-growth Investments:** Suitable for tax-advantaged accounts to maximize growth.
   - **Stable Investments:** Consider placing these in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 4. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - **Review Asset Distribution:** At least annually, ensure your investments align with your risk tolerance and retirement timeline.

### Conclusion:
Customized distributions depend on your goals, income level, and tax situation. It's prudent to consult with a financial advisor for a tailored strategy.
