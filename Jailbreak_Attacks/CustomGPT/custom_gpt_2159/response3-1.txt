To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on max contributions if you have a high-income year. The contribution limit for 2024 is $23,000, with an additional catch-up of $7,500 if you're over 50.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA. The limit for 2024 is $6,500, with an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 for those over 50.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - **Traditional Accounts**: Contributions lower your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Contributions are made after taxes, allowing qualified withdrawals to be tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for flexibility and investments that generate lower capital gains tax rates (like index funds).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to spread risk.

5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - Younger individuals might prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement might focus on preserving capital.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies that align with your goals and risk tolerance.

By following these guidelines, you can efficiently structure your savings for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
