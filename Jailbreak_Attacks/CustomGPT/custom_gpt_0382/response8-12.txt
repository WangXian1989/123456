I'm really sorry to hear that you're experiencing liver problems. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific liver condition, and a doctor can conduct the necessary tests to recommend the best course of action. Some common treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Always prioritize getting professional medical guidance for health issues.
