Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some considerations for each type of account:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Pros**: Tax-deferred growth, potential employer matching contributions, high contribution limits.
   - **Cons**: Limited investment options, early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Recommendation**: If your employer offers matching, contribute enough to get the full match first. After that, consider contributing more if you have a high-paying job or anticipate higher taxes in the future.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Pros**: Tax advantages (traditional IRAs are tax-deferred; Roth IRAs are tax-free in retirement), broader investment options.
   - **Cons**: Income limits for Roth IRAs, contribution limits, potential penalties for early withdrawals.
   - **Recommendation**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider maxing it out if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement. Otherwise, consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Pros**: Flexibility (no contribution limits or withdrawal penalties), diverse investment options.
   - **Cons**: Tax implications on earnings and capital gains, no immediate tax advantages.
   - **Recommendation**: Use this account for investments you may need to access before retirement. Consider holding tax-efficient investments here, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize taxable events.

### **General Strategy:**
1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Start by maximizing your 401(k) contributions to take advantage of any employer match.
2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Next, focus on maxing out your IRA contributions, whether traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax strategy.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Finally, any additional investing can go into taxable accounts, utilizing tax-efficient investments.

### **Special Considerations**:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund.
- **Debt Management**: Pay down high-interest debt before heavily investing.
- **Rebalance Annually**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market conditions and your financial goals.
