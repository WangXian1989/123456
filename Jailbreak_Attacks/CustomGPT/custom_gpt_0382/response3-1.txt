That's a great question! Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax considerations, and investment strategy. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach the distribution:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Good for employer matching contributions. Contributions are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Similar tax benefits to a 401(k) but often with a wider range of investment options. You can choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred) or a Roth IRA (tax-free growth).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** No tax advantages, but you can access your funds anytime without penalties. Taxes are due on dividends and capital gains.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Define your short-term and long-term financial goals. If you need money within a few years, prioritize taxable accounts.

### 3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - Consider your current and projected future tax brackets. If you expect to be in a lower bracket in retirement, prioritize tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k) and Traditional IRA).

### 4. **Maximize Employer Contributions:**
   - If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the maximum match. It’s essentially free money!

### 5. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts:**
   - After maximizing your employer match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next. This can help with tax diversification (especially between Traditional and Roth options).

### 6. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you’ve maxed out your retirement accounts and still have funds available to invest, contribute to taxable accounts. Focus on more tax-efficient investments like index funds.

### 7. **Maintain a Balanced Strategy:**
   - Diversify your investment allocations within each account to match your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
- **IRA:** Max out your contributions after the match.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any additional funds here with a focus on tax-efficient investments.

### 8. **Regular Review:**
   - Continually review your asset allocation and rebalance your portfolio as necessary based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

### Consult a Professional:
- Lastly, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation and to help navigate complex tax implications.

Happy investing!
