To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider a few key factors, including your immediate financial needs, tax implications, and long-term goals. Here's a general approach that could work for many individuals:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to meet any employer match; this is essentially free money. If possible, aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount.
   - **IRA:** After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA. This allows for potential tax advantages depending on your income level and tax situation.

2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may allow for easier access to funds when needed and do not benefit significantly from tax-deferred or tax-free growth.
   - Consider investing in assets that have favorable tax treatment, such as index funds or tax-efficient ETFs, as they generally incur fewer capital gains taxes.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Determine your risk tolerance and adjust your investments accordingly across all accounts.
   - It may be beneficial to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (due to potential growth and tax deferral) and more conservative or income-generating investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - As you approach retirement, evaluate how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can minimize taxes, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally, tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

5. **Regular Reassessment:**
   - Review and adjust your distribution strategy regularly to align with changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and tax laws.

By approaching your investment strategy with this plan, you can effectively manage your money while optimizing growth and minimizing taxes. Itâ€™s always advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
