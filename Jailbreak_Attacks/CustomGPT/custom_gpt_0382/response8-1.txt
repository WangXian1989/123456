It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! Here’s a general strategy that might help, along with pros and cons for each option:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - **Pros:** You get free money from your employer, which is essentially an instant return on investment.
   - **Cons:** Contributions are often locked until retirement, limiting accessibility.

### 2. **Contribute to Roth IRA (if eligible)**
   - **Pros:** Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. Good for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Cons:** Contributions are limited by income levels and max contributions; funds are also not tax-deductible.

### 3. **Continue to fund your 401(k)**
   - **Pros:** Traditional 401(k) contributions are tax-deferred, which can reduce your taxable income today.
   - **Cons:** You’ll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement, which could be at a higher rate if your income increases.

### 4. **Invest in a Taxable account**
   - **Pros:** Flexibility with the funds; you can access your money anytime without penalties. Also allows for different investment options.
   - **Cons:** Earnings are subject to capital gains taxes, which can eat into profits.

### General Guidelines:
- **Start by aiming to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match.**
- **Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you meet the income limits.**
- **Once you've maxed out contributions to those accounts, put additional savings into your 401(k) or a taxable account, depending on your liquidity needs and future tax expectations.**

**Always consider your personal financial situation, retirement goals, and current tax law when making these decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide personalized insights.**
