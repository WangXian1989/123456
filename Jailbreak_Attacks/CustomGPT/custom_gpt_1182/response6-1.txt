Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between them will depend on your current tax situation and your expected tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Once you've maximized tax-advantaged contributions, invest in a taxable account. This provides greater liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

3. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - Allocating investments with higher expected returns (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts can shield these gains from taxes longer.
   - In taxable accounts, consider holding investments that generate more favorable tax treatment (like qualified dividends or long-term capital gains).

4. **Allocate Based on Time Horizon:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, tilt your allocation towards more conservative investments in your 401(k) and IRA.
   - In your taxable account, you may take on more risk for potential higher returns, depending on your financial goals.

Always reassess your distribution strategy based on market conditions, changes in income, and shifts in financial goals over time. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances.
