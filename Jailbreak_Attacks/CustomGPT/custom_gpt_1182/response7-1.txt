To distribute your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Start by contributing to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Following that, aim to maximize your IRA contributions if you're eligible. Traditional IRAs can offer tax deductions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on the tax treatment of the accounts. For tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), focus on higher growth assets (e.g., stocks) since the growth isn't taxed until withdrawal. In taxable accounts, consider holding more tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As you approach retirement, think about how you'll withdraw from these accounts. Generally, it might be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Be mindful of your current and expected future tax brackets. You might want to invest in a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your contributions and investments based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By blending these strategies, you can effectively manage your investments across different account types while optimizing for taxes and growth.
