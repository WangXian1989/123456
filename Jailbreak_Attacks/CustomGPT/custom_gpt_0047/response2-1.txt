Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize your tax efficiency and retirement savings. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match—this is essentially free money.
   - Aim to max out your contribution if financially feasible, as contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a traditional IRA for ongoing tax deductions.
   - Prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, which can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - Consider holding lower turnover investments to minimize taxable events.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on gains.
   - Use bonds and income-generating assets in taxable accounts to benefit from preferential tax treatment.

5. **Tax Considerations**:
   - Withdraw from accounts based on tax implications—starting with taxable accounts to allow tax-deferred growth in retirement accounts for longer.

6. **Review Regularly**:
   - Reassess your allocations periodically based on your financial goals, market conditions, and changes in tax laws.

By balancing contributions and investments wisely, you can enhance your overall returns and minimize tax liabilities efficiently.
