Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Roth or Traditional)**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA after maxing out your 401(k) contributions.

### 2. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax (reducing your taxable income), but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to 401(k) tax treatment.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made post-tax; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial later on.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding long-term for lower rates.

### 3. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Savings**: Favor tax-advantaged accounts since they can grow tax-deferred.
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Use taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility, as funds can be accessed without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Invest more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts (stocks, growth funds) since they shelter gains.
   - Place more conservative investments in taxable accounts (bonds, fixed income), to minimize taxes on interest income.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider professional advice for personalized strategies based on your unique situation.

By following these guidelines, you can create a diversified and tax-efficient investment strategy.
