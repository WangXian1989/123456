Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute at least enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA next, depending on your income and tax situation.
   - **401(k):** If you haven't maxed your 401(k), continue contributing until you reach the limit.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you have maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This offers flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Place equities in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.
   - **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider Roth options for tax-free withdrawals later.

### 6. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure you have sufficient cash reserves outside these accounts for short-term needs.

### Summary
1. **401(k)** for employer matching.
2. **IRA** for additional tax benefits.
3. **Taxable accounts** for flexibility after maximizing other accounts.
