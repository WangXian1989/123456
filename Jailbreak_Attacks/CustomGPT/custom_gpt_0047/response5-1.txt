Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Consider maxing out your IRA, especially if it's a Roth IRA, offering tax-free growth.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate lower tax burdens, like bonds or funds with low turnover.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for future withdrawals; understand the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type.

5. **Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
