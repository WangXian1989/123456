To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Efficiency
- **Max out tax-advantaged accounts first:** Prioritize contributing to your 401(k) and IRA, as they offer tax benefits that can enhance savings growth.
- **Utilize Roth IRA if eligible:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. Investment Choices
- **401(k) for employer match:** Contribute at least enough to get any employer match, as it's essentially free money.
- **Diversify across accounts:** Allocate different assets in each account type. For example, hold high-growth stocks in a taxable account and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax exposure.

### 3. Withdrawal Strategy
- **Plan for withdrawals:** Think about how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement. Taxable accounts can provide flexibility, while tapping into tax-advantaged accounts may help manage tax brackets.

### 4. Rebalancing
- **Regularly review your allocations:** Assess your investment performance and adjust contributions as needed to maintain desired asset allocation.

### 5. Seek Professional Advice
- **Consult a financial advisor:** Tailoring strategy to your specific situation can maximize benefits and address goals effectively.

By prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts and carefully choosing investment allocation, you can optimize your savings for retirement.
