To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Roth or Traditional IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you need tax deductions, consider a Traditional IRA.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: Once your IRA is funded, increase your contributions to your 401(k). Aim for the annual contribution limit.

4. **Invest Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Use taxable accounts for short-term goals or if you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

5. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: Consider your current and expected future tax brackets. For instance, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, prioritize Roth contributions.

6. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk and improve returns.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations and investment performance, adjusting as needed based on financial goals and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also provide personalized strategies based on your specific circumstances.
