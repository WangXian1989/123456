To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Aim to contribute up to the contribution limit, especially if you receive a match.
   - **IRA**: Next, consider opening or maxing out a Traditional or Roth IRA (choose based on your tax situation).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts if you’ve maxed out your tax-advantaged accounts. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes and sectors to manage risk effectively.

5. **Regular Contributions**: Set up automatic contributions to each account to stay on track with your investment goals.

6. **Reassess Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation and adjust based on changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
