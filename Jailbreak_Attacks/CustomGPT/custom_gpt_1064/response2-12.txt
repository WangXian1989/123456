I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver issues, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Medications**: Depending on the cause (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver), medications can help manage symptoms and improve liver function.

2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Eating a balanced diet, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests help track your condition.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures or liver transplants may be considered.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some find relief through herbal supplements or acupuncture, but consult a doctor first.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a personalized treatment plan.
