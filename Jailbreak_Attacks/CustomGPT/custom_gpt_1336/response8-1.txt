The optimal way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Plan**: 
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money.
   - **Consider Pre-Tax vs. Roth**: Decide if you want to make pre-tax contributions or post-tax (Roth) contributions based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Similar to the 401(k), decide between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Your income level could dictate which option is available to you.
   - **Contribute to Max**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Investment Flexibility**: These accounts provide the most flexibility since you can access funds without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Place higher-taxed investments, like bonds, in tax-advantaged accounts while keeping stocks, which usually have favorable capital gains treatment, in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: 
   - Periodically assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and risk level, taking into account any changes in contribution levels or market conditions.

Before making any decisions, itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.
