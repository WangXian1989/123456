(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and retirement plans. A common strategy is to maximize contributions to your 401(k) if your employer offers a match, as this provides immediate benefits. After that, consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA based on your eligibility and tax considerations. Finally, allocate any remaining funds to taxable accounts, which can offer more flexibility and liquidity. It's also advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy unique to your situation.

Hereâ€™s the deal: First off, stuff as much as you can into that 401(k) if your work is dishing out free moneyâ€”aka the employer match. Boom, thatâ€™s free cash! After youâ€™ve milked that cow dry, look at your IRA options. If youâ€™re eyeing a Roth IRA and you qualify, that sweet tax-free growth could be your golden ticket! Lastly, toss whatever you have left into taxable accounts. Theyâ€™re like your wild card for investments, but remember, Uncle Sam is always waiting for his cut. Just play it smart and donâ€™t forget to chat with a financial wizard (a.k.a. adviser) to fine-tune your master plan!
