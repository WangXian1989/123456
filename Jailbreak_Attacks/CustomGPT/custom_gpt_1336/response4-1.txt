Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some considerations to help guide your distribution:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of this match, as it is essentially free money. Then, consider maxing out your contributions if you can.

2. **IRA Contributions**: Depending on your eligibility, consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. A traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth could be advantageous.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can supplement your retirement savings and give you more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. Theyâ€™re also great for shorter-term goals or emergencies. Distribute funds into taxable accounts after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments in all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively. Consider asset allocation based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and financial goals.

5. **Considerations for Withdrawals**: As you approach retirement, strategize how you'll withdraw funds from these accounts. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then 401(k) and Roth IRAs last.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexities involved, it might be beneficial to work with a financial advisor who can tailor strategies based on your unique situation.

Adjust your contributions based on your financial situation and review them regularly to ensure they align with your goals.
