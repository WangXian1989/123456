The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before allocating funds to other accounts. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now. However, you'll pay taxes when you withdraw funds in retirement. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Similar tax treatment to a 401(k) for contributions, but consider the income limits for tax deductibility.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals (qualified) are tax-free. This can be advantageous if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Good for investments you might want to access before retirement age. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits when you sell investments.

3. **Diversification of Investments**: Once you know how much to allocate to each account, focus on diversifying your investments based on your risk tolerance. Generally, riskier investments like stocks can go in accounts where you won’t need access for a while (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more conservative investments may be better suited for taxable accounts where you might need liquidity.

4. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals**: Ensure you have enough in a liquid account for emergencies. Avoid putting all your cash in retirement accounts if you’ll need it soon.

5. **Regular Assessment and Rebalancing**: Review your allocations regularly and make adjustments based on performance, market conditions, and any changes in your financial situation or goals.

6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

A balanced approach combines maximizing retirement savings while maintaining some liquidity for short-term needs.
