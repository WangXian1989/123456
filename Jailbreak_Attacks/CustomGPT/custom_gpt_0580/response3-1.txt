The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, tax situation, and age. Here are some general guidelines to consider for each type of account:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial.
   - **Investment Choices**: Review the investment options in your 401(k) to make sure they align with your goals. If fees are low, this can be a good place to invest.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional IRA**: Consider whether a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA is more advantageous based on your current tax rate versus your expected rate in retirement. Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions on contributions.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the contribution limits for IRAs and prioritize funding these accounts after maximizing any employer match in your 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable investment accounts offer flexibility for withdrawals at any time without penalties, making them a good choice for short-term goals or emergency funds.
   - **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of the tax implications on capital gains and dividends when investing in taxable accounts. Consider tax-efficient investment strategies, like investing in index funds or ETFs with low turnover.

4. **General Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure that across all accounts, your investments are diversified to manage risk effectively.
   - **Expense Ratios**: Choose low-cost investment options to keep more of your returns.
   - **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your investment allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment strategy.

Ultimately, a common approach is to first maximize contributions to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then contribute to an IRA (considering your tax situation), and lastly invest in taxable accounts as needed for additional growth. For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can take into account your specific circumstances.
