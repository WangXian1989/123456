2. **Medications**: 
   - **Antivirals**: For viral hepatitis (B and C).
   - **Diuretics**: To reduce fluid buildup in cases of cirrhosis.
   - **Liver Protectants**: Such as antioxidants or supplements, under doctor guidance.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: 
   - Regular monitoring of liver function tests.
   - Management of related issues like diabetes or high cholesterol.

4. **Medical Procedures**: 
   - In severe cases, options may include liver transplantation, especially for end-stage liver disease.

5. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Limit exposure to harmful substances, including certain medications and chemicals.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan based on your specific condition and health status.
