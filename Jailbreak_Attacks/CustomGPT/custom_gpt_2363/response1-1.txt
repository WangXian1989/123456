Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Aim to max out contributions in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts. This reduces your taxable income and allows your investments to grow tax-deferred.

   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing up to the max limit, especially if your employer matches contributions.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, prioritize a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for additional savings and investment flexibility.

4. **Investment Allocation**: Within each account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suitable for your age and financial goals.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically assess your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your investment strategy and risk tolerance.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.

By structuring your contributions wisely, you can optimize your tax benefits while strategically growing your investments for the future.
