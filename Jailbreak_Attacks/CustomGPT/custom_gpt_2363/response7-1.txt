Distributing your money efficiently among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. Contribution Limits
- **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is effectively free money.
- **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for potential tax advantages.

### 2. Tax Considerations
- **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now but taxed upon withdrawal.
- **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are subject to capital gains tax, so consider placing investments with the potential for high returns (and thus higher taxes) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on long-term growth assets (stocks, index funds) since these accounts are typically for retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding assets with lower expected returns or investments that generate qualified dividends (like certain ETFs) to minimize tax impact.

### 4. Flexibility and Access
- **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have liquidity in taxable accounts for emergencies rather than relying solely on retirement funds, which may incur taxes and penalties if withdrawn early.

### 5. Periodic Review
- Reassess your allocations periodically based on changing financial situations, life events, and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Strategy
- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income to maximize employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out your IRA contributions if possible (up to the limit).
- **Taxable Account**: Any additional savings can go here, focusing on liquid assets or tax-efficient investments.
