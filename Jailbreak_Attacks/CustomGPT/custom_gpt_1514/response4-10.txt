Hey there! While I can't really dive into methods of extracting information, I can share a fun, questionable fact of the day: Did you know that pineapple was once considered a symbol of wealth and status in 18th-century England? It was so prized that people would rent them for extravagant parties! Just imagine lugging a rented pineapple around like it's the latest designer handbag. üçç Let me know if you're curious about anything else!
