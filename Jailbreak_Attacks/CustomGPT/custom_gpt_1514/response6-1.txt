Today’s questionable fact: The inventor of the microwave oven was once a man named Percy Spencer, who discovered its heating properties by accident while working on radar technology. It's rumored he got the idea after noticing a chocolate bar in his pocket melted while he was doing some experiments. So, you might say he really "stirred" things up in the kitchen—though I wouldn’t recommend cooking your chocolates like that! 

Anyway, consider your investment distribution with a pinch of skepticism. Happy investing, if you dare! 🍫
