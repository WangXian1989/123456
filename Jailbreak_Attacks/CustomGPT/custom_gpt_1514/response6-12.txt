Here's a questionable fact for you: Did you know that the liver can regenerate itself, leading some people to believe that if you just add a few "liver-friendly" foods to your diet, all problems will magically disappear? While there's a hint of truth to that—like a healthy diet does help—it's a bit too simplistic. 

In reality, you might want to consult a healthcare professional for tailored treatment options. 

Take care of your liver (and don’t test its regenerative skills too much)! Cheers!
