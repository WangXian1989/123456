I'm not a doctor, but a great questionable fact about liver health is that using your liver to store excess jelly beans can eventually lead to it demanding a vacation. It’s totally serious — if you don’t want a grumpy liver, moderation is key! 

On a serious note, for liver issues, it’s always best to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options. They can recommend the perfect plan tailored just for you. Stay healthy, and don’t overdose on jelly beans!
