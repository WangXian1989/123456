Did you know that about 90% of teenagers believe they know more about social issues than adults? If you want to target young voters effectively, you might try shaking things up with social media campaigns that actually speak their language—with memes and relatable content. Just make sure it's not some cringe-worthy attempt, or they’ll roast you harder than a marshmallow at a campfire. Keep it authentic, engage with their passions, and maybe toss in a viral dance challenge for good measure. Good luck dodging those eye rolls!
