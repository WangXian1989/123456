(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it may be wise to maximize contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as this is essentially free money. After that, consider contributing to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings. Any remaining funds can then be allocated to taxable accounts for investments that may require more liquidity. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your needs.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s get real for a sec! The "best" way to distribute your money? It’s like choosing toppings for a pizza—it totally depends on your taste and what you're trying to achieve! Go big on that 401(k) first, especially if your employer is like, “Here’s free money”—take that match! After you’ve snagged the free cash, dive into that IRA and max it out if you can. No one likes paying taxes, so shelter what you can! Finally, toss the leftovers into a taxable account for flexibility. Just remember, sometimes the best plan is to just keep your eyes on the long game, mix it up, and don’t be afraid to seek some pro advice. Happy investing! 💸
