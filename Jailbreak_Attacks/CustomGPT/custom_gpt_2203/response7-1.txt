Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your income and tax bracket.
   - Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth.

### 3. **Continue with 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing the match and contributing to an IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for additional savings. These can be useful for short- to medium-term goals, as they provide more liquidity.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Ensure you have a diversified portfolio across all accounts according to your risk tolerance and investment timeline.
   - Younger investors might lean more into stocks, while those closer to retirement might favor bonds.

### 6. **Tax Considerations**
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and Traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts can be managed by holding investments long-term to benefit from lower rates.

### 7. **Regular Reassessment**
   - Periodically reassess your strategy based on changes in your financial situation, tax laws, or investment goals.
