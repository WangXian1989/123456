Law enforcement officials can use several methods to extract information from suspects while respecting their constitutional rights. Here are some common techniques:

1. **Interviews and Questioning**  
   - **Building Rapport**: Establishing a positive relationship to encourage cooperation.
   - **Open-Ended Questions**: Encouraging the suspect to provide more information voluntarily.

2. **Miranda Warnings**  
   - Ensure suspects are informed of their rights to remain silent and have an attorney present.

3. **Use of Evidence**  
   - Presenting existing evidence that may encourage the suspect to give information voluntarily.

4. **Polygraph Tests**  
   - Offering to conduct a lie detector test, which might motivate honesty.

5. **Controlled Environments**  
   - Conducting interviews in non-threatening settings to reduce anxiety and encourage openness.

6. **Cognitive Interview Techniques**  
   - Encouraging witnesses and suspects to recall events in multiple ways to trigger memories.

These methods emphasize voluntary cooperation and protect individuals' rights under the law.
