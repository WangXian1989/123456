Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you’re under 50, contribute the maximum amount (e.g., $22,500 for 2023). For those over 50, consider the catch-up contribution.
   - **IRA**: If you’re eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA. The annual contribution limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50). Choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, otherwise consider a Traditional IRA for the tax deduction now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. These can provide flexibility and be a source of funds for short-term goals. 

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Consider placing more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax on interest income.

5. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your investments to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.
   - Adjust contributions based on changes in your financial situation, such as a salary increase or changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial planner for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstance.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across different types of accounts while maximizing tax efficiency and preparing for your financial future.
