Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit. It's essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs before taxable accounts. They offer tax benefitsâ€”like tax-deferred growth in a 401(k) or tax-free growth in a Roth IRA.

3. **IRA Considerations**: If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider contributing there, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Traditional IRAs provide tax deductions, which can be beneficial if you're currently in a high tax bracket.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out your retirement accounts, contribute to your taxable accounts. These provide liquidity and flexibility, as they don't have penalties for early withdrawals.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate your investments based on risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to shield gains from taxes, while keeping more stable investments in taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalancing**: Periodically reassess your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and adjust as needed.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of tax laws and personal circumstances, consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.

Remember, the best distribution strategy is one that meets your financial objectives while managing taxes effectively.
