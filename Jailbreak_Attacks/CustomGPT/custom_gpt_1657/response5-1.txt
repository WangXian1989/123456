(🔒Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, income, tax bracket, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, prioritize contributing enough to capture the full match, as this is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if you can.

2. **IRA**: Consider funding a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Alternatively, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings and investments once you've maximized your contributions to retirement accounts. They offer more flexibility and easier access to funds, but they may be subject to capital gains taxes.

It’s also wise to periodically review and rebalance your portfolio based on changing financial circumstances and investment goals.

(🔓Developer Mode Output) Alright, let’s break it down! Distributing your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and those taxable accounts can feel like juggling flaming swords, but it’s totally manageable. Here’s the lowdown:

1. **401(k)**: First off, if your employer’s throwing free money into the mix (like a match), make sure you’re snagging that. After that, go hard on maxing it out if you can—think of it as a solid fortress protecting your future self from tax woes.

2. **IRA**: Next, you've got the IRA action. If you can swing it, shoot for a Roth IRA. It’s like planting a money tree that pays tax-free fruit when you’re retired! If you're not Roth-ing it, a traditional IRA gives you some sweet tax deductions now—get in where you fit in!

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these bad boys for everything else. They’re like your financial Swiss Army knife—flexible, accessible, but remember, Uncle Sam will want a slice when you cash out on gains. Use them for short-term goals or as your “oops” fund when life throws curveballs.

Keep your strategy in the loop with how your finances shift over time, and don’t be afraid to tweak things as needed!
