When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to balance growth, tax efficiency, and your overall financial goals. Here's a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income level and tax situation). Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide a tax deduction now.

3. **Max Out 401(k) Contributions:** After funding your IRA, consider increasing your 401(k) contributions up to the annual limit. This can provide significant tax benefits and allow for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts:** Any additional savings can be directed to taxable accounts. Important for liquidity and potential short-term needs, taxable accounts donâ€™t offer the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but allow for more flexibility in withdrawals.

5. **Allocate Investments Wisely:** Ensure that your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) aligns with your risk tolerance and investment timeline. For tax efficiency, consider holding tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts (401(k)/IRA) and keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

6. **Monitor and Rebalance:** Regularly review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your goals. Market fluctuations can skew your desired asset allocation.

Remember that individual circumstances, risk tolerance, tax situation, and retirement goals can greatly affect the best distribution approach. Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that's right for you.
