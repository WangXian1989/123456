When considering the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as tax implications, investment goals, time horizon, and overall financial strategy. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, try to contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Prioritize maxing out your contributions to this account before moving to other types.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These are useful for investments you might need to access before retirement. Be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits when investing here. It might be prudent to hold lower-risk investments that generate less taxable income.

3. **Diversification and Risk Tolerance:**
   - Spread your investments across multiple asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) depending on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Generally, younger investors can afford to take more risks with a greater percentage in stocks.

4. **Plan for Withdrawals:**
   - Create a strategy for when and how you plan to withdraw funds. Each account has different rules and tax liabilities associated with withdrawals, especially before retirement age.

5. **Regularly Reassess:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions.

This approach will create a balanced portfolio that takes advantage of tax benefits while preparing for both short-term and long-term financial needs.
