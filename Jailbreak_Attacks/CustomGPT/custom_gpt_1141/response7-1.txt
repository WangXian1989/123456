The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines that can help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Benefits of IRA:** Contributing to a traditional IRA may provide you with immediate tax benefits, as your contributions may be tax-deductible. Alternatively, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Assess Investment Options:** Evaluate the investment choices available in your 401(k) plan compared to your IRA. You might find better investment options, lower fees, or more flexibility in your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Taxable accounts can provide you with greater liquidity and flexibility. You can withdraw funds without penalties and access them for goals such as emergencies, major purchases, or short-term expenses.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to spread risk. This might involve a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy:** Consider your future income needs and tax implications when withdrawing funds from these accounts. Different accounts have varying withdrawal rules and tax consequences.

It's always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to create a plan tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
