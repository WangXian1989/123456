Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing the 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Consider Contributions Limits:**
   - Be mindful of the annual contribution limits for each account type. As of 2023, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for an IRA, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are typically tax-deductible, reducing your taxable income now, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **Roth 401(k) and IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Earnings are subject to capital gains tax. These can be useful for investments that you may want to liquidate without penalty or for short-term goals.

4. **Determine Your Investment Strategy:**
   - Align your investment choices with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Generally, more aggressive investments may go into tax-advantaged accounts (to shield from taxes), while conservative investments may go into taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically:**
   - Over time, your asset allocation may shift due to market fluctuations. Review and rebalance your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired level of risk.

6. **Use Tax-Loss Harvesting in Taxable Accounts:**
   - If you have losers in your taxable accounts, consider selling them to offset gains and potentially reduce your tax bill.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances, helping you optimize your investment distribution.

By following these steps, you can create a diversified approach to managing your investments across different account types.
