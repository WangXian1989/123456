To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Maximize your employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount ($22,500 for 2023, plus catch-up contributions if you're over 50).

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Prioritize contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - If a Roth is not an option, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, balancing your taxable income.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these accounts for investments that might generate short-term gains, such as bonds or actively traded stocks.
   - Consider investing in index funds or ETFs due to their tax efficiency.

### General Allocation Strategy:
- **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (401(k) and IRA)**: Focus on high-growth investments (like stocks) since taxes are deferred or non-existent.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on lower-growth, tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Considerations:
- Assess your current tax bracket and retirement goals.
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation. 

This balanced approach can help you maximize your growth while being mindful of taxes.
