Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Benefit from tax-deferred growth and potential employer contributions. Focus on this if you have a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later. Traditional IRAs provide immediate tax deductions but taxes apply upon withdrawal.

3. **Consider Taxes**: 
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are ideal for investments you'll need access to before retirement, as they offer flexibility. However, you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset types in each account (stocks, bonds, etc.) to spread risk.

5. **Age and Retirement Plans**: Younger investors might lean toward aggressive growth in tax-advantaged accounts, while those nearing retirement may prefer conservative investments.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Tailored advice can optimize your specific situation and plans.

Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on changes in your financial situation and goals.
