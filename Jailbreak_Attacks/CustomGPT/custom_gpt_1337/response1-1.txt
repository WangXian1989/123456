Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. Itâ€™s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA**: A traditional IRA offers similar tax benefits, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, though contributions are made with after-tax dollars.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of expenses.

4. **Diversification**: Hold a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across these accounts, tailored to your risk tolerance and investment time horizon.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - Place higher-tax investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) and lower-tax investments (like stocks) in taxable accounts for potential capital gains tax benefits.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: As retirement approaches, consider how you'll withdraw from these accounts to manage taxes effectively.

7. **Regular Review**: Revisit your allocations periodically to adjust for changes in income, expenses, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your situation.
