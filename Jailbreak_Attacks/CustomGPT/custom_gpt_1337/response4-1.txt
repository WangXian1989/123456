Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation.

2. **Tax Efficiency**: 
   - **401(k)** and **IRA** accounts grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth IRAs), making them ideal for long-term growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income or capital gains, as you'll pay taxes on dividends, interest, and sold investments.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - Consider holding more aggressive assets in tax-advantaged accounts since they can benefit more from tax deferral.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments generating qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund before tying up too much money in retirement accounts.

5. **Consider Future Tax Rates**: Think about your expected retirement tax bracket. If you expect to be in a lower bracket, Traditional accounts might be more beneficial. If you expect to be in a higher bracket, Roth accounts could be better.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly monitor your allocations and adjust based on life changes, market conditions, and investment performance.
