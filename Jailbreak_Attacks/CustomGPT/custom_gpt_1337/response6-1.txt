Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match (free money!). Aim for the maximum contribution limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. This can provide additional tax benefits.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for funds that you might need before retirement, or for investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, as these may be taxed at a lower rate.

### 3. **Investment Strategy**
   - **Equities in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Place higher-growth investments like stocks in your 401(k) or IRA to benefit from tax-sheltered growth.
   - **Bonds in Taxable Accounts**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts since they generate interest income, which is taxed at ordinary income rates.

### 4. **Emergency Fund**
   - Ensure that you have a solid emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawals that can incur penalties.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan how and when you will withdraw from each account at retirement to minimize taxes.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your individual situation!
