Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match in your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum limit, especially if you receive a match.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to an IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses) before investing heavily in these accounts.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. This provides flexibility for accessing funds before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Within each account, diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to align with your goals and market conditions.

7. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawals from each account type, as they vary significantly.

Adjust this strategy based on your personal circumstances, and consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
