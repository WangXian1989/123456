The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: Each account type has specific contribution limits. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (or $30,000 if age 50 or older) and $6,500 for an IRA (or $7,500 if age 50 or older). Maximize contributions to accounts with employer matches first.

2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt**: Before investing, it may be beneficial to pay off high-interest debt (like credit cards).

3. **Utilize Employer Matching in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is free money.

4. **Balance Tax Benefits**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now, but you’ll pay taxes on withdrawals during retirement.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Traditional or Roth IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible or tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have tax advantages, but you can withdraw money without penalties or special rules.

5. **Consider Your Investment Horizon**: If you are far from retirement, you might prioritize investing in the stock market through your 401(k) and IRA. As you approach retirement, you may want to increase your allocation to more conservative investments.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash) is diversified across all accounts to manage risk and optimize growth.

7. **Review Tax Implications**: Consider the tax implications of withdrawing from each account type in retirement. For example, withdrawing from a taxable account may have different tax consequences than from a 401(k) or IRA.

8. **Stay Flexible and Review Regularly**: Your financial situation and tax laws can change, so regularly review and adjust your contribution strategy to meet your evolving goals.

By following these guidelines, you can create a balanced and effective strategy for distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your unique circumstances.
