The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to take full advantage of it. This is essentially free money.

2. **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions to these accounts may be tax-deductible, and your investments grow tax-deferred. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, prioritizing these accounts can be beneficial.

3. **Roth IRA**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider contributing to a Roth IRA. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts can be more flexible for access to funds before retirement age without penalties. However, youâ€™ll owe taxes on dividends and capital gains. Consider using taxable accounts for investments that are less tax-efficient (like high-growth stocks) if you anticipate holding them long-term.

5. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, diversify your investments to spread risk across various assets (stocks, bonds, etc.).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a distribution strategy tailored to your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, regularly review and adjust your contributions based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.
