I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on liver problems. Treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition, but they may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in some cases, procedures to manage or treat the underlying issue. Itâ€™s crucial to seek medical advice tailored to your situation.
