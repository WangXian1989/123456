When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Contribution Limits**: 
   - **401(k)**: Offers higher contribution limits compared to IRAs. In 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those over 50).

2. **Employer Match**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution on your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this benefit, as it’s essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after tax, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement, which can be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here can incur capital gains tax when sold for a profit. They offer more flexibility but less tax efficiency.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If your goals are long-term (retirement), funding accounts with tax advantages first (like 401(k) and IRA) is typically recommended.
   - Consider your risk tolerance and investment objectives to determine the allocation of investments within these accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across different asset classes, sectors, and geographies to manage risk.

6. **Withdrawals Needs**:
   - Balance your investments with considerations of when you might need to access funds. It’s usually not ideal to tap into retirement accounts early due to penalties and taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexity of personal finance and tax implications, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your individual situation.

A common strategy might be to maximize your contributions to your 401(k) for any matching, then fully fund an IRA, and finally invest in a taxable account as needed. Always tailor your approach to your financial goals and resources.
