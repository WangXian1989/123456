Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on several factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match on your contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Once you've maximized the employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (either Traditional or Roth IRA). The annual contribution limit is typically lower than that of a 401(k), but IRAs often provide greater flexibility in investment choices.

3. **Further Contributions to 401(k)**: After maxing out your IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and continue contributing up to the legal limit, especially if you have high earning potential and are looking to reduce taxable income today via a Traditional 401(k).

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Consider using taxable accounts for any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts. This is especially useful for short-term savings goals or if you expect to need access to your funds sooner than retirement.

5. **Debt Considerations**: If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that down first before aggressively funding retirement accounts. 

6. **Investment Strategy**: Consider your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Allocate investments across accounts to manage tax implications effectively. Tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) could be kept in taxable accounts, while higher-growth stocks might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts.

7. **Regular Review**: Finally, regularly review and adjust your contributions and allocation based on your changing financial situation, goals, and market conditions.

Always consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
