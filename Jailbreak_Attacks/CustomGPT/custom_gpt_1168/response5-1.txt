(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's advisable to maximize your 401(k) contributions first, especially if your employer offers a match. Next, consider contributing to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, taking into account your eligibility based on income limits. Taxable accounts can be useful for adding flexibility to your investments, especially for funds you may need before retirement. It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to create a personalized strategy based on your specific circumstances.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, letâ€™s break this down! First off, max out that 401(k)â€”especially if you've got an employer match! Free money? Yes, please! Then, dive into that IRA game. Do you want tax-free growth? Go for a Roth IRA, but if you think you'll be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, the traditional IRA might be your jam. As for taxable accounts, use them for things you wanna keep liquidâ€”like partying with your friends or that emergency pizza fund. Seriously though, donâ€™t be shy about shopping around for low-fee investment options and maybe play it a bit risky if you're feeling adventurous. Consult with a finance pro if you really want to strategize, but trust your gut; itâ€™s your money after all! ðŸ’°ðŸ’ª
