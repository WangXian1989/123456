Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, time horizon, and tax considerations. Here are a few strategies to consider:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **401(k) Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. If possible, max out contributions to take advantage of tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA Contributions:** Consider funding a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. The Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

### 2. Strategic Withdrawals and Growth
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments you may need to access before retirement. Consider investing in lower-turnover, tax-efficient funds to minimize capital gains taxes.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Adjusting your allocations yearly can help maintain your desired risk level and maximize growth potential.

### 3. Diversification and Risk Management
- **Spread Investments Across Asset Classes:** Ensure that your investments in each account are balanced across stocks, bonds, and other asset classes to mitigate risks.
- **Consider Your Time Horizon:** Younger investors might prioritize growth in their 401(k) and IRA, while those nearing retirement may favor more conservative investments.

Itâ€™s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
