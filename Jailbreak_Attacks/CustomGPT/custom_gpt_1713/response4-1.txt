When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors come into play, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, and tax implications. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match on 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and a great way to enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Contribute to an IRA:** Once you've received the full employer match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. IRAs often have broader investment choices compared to 401(k)s and can provide tax advantages.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications:** 401(k) contributions are typically made pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Determine which option aligns best with your tax strategy.

4. **Allocate Surplus Funds:** If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA contributions, consider utilizing a taxable account. This can provide flexibility since you can access your money without penalties, unlike retirement accounts.

5. **Diversify Investments:** Regardless of the account type, ensure you are diversifying your investments to reduce risk. This could mean holding a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across different accounts.

6. **Regularly Reassess:** Your financial situation and market conditions can change. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your long-term goals.

If you're uncertain about the best approach for your individual situation, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
