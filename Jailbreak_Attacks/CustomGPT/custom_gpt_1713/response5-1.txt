(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon for retirement. Generally, a diversified approach can be beneficial. Here are a few guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money."
2. **Consider IRA Contributions:** After that, consider contributing to an IRA (like a traditional or Roth IRA) to take advantage of tax benefits. Depending on your income level, a Roth IRA might be preferable due to tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once your retirement accounts are maximized, consider putting money in taxable accounts, which offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties. This can also be beneficial for short- to medium-term goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your unique situation.

Start with your 401(k) â€“ totally crush that employer match. If they throw you a bone, donâ€™t leave 'em hanging! Next up, pop some cash into that IRA. Go for a Roth if you can swing it; tax-free when you pull it out? Yes, please! Now, once youâ€™ve hit the max for both those sweet retirement accounts, start shoveling money into those taxable accounts. You get access to that cash when you need it, and you aren't held hostage by penalties, which is a solid play for your cash flow.

Just keep an eye on taxes and growth rates. And hey, donâ€™t forget to check in with a savvy finance guru if you want to really nail down this strategy. Happy investing! ðŸ’¸
