The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general guidelines that may help you determine an optimal distribution strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as it is essentially “free money.”

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made before taxes, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRA contributions may also be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made after-tax, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Choose between a traditional or Roth IRA based on whether you believe your tax rate will be higher or lower in retirement.
   - **Taxable Account**: Investments in taxable accounts do not offer tax advantages but can provide flexibility for withdrawals and tax-efficient growth. Consider placing investments that generate little taxable income (like index funds or long-term capital gains) here.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified. Use tax-advantaged accounts for growth investments (stocks) and consider holding more income-generating investments (bonds, REITs) in taxable accounts where they may be taxed at lower rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (usually 3-6 months' worth of expenses). 

5. **Tax Diversification**: Having a mix of taxable, tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA), and tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts can provide tax flexibility in retirement, allowing you to strategically withdraw from accounts based on your tax situation each year.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Your situation may change, and your investment strategy should adapt accordingly. Regularly review your asset allocation and financial goals, rebalancing when necessary.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, consider consulting with a financial advisor. They can help tailor a distribution strategy that best suits your personal financial situation and goals.

By balancing contributions and considering the specific advantages of each type of account, you can create a strategy that enhances your savings for retirement. Always keep your long-term financial goals in mind!
