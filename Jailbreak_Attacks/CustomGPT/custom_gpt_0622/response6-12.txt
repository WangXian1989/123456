Iâ€™m not a doctor, but it's important to seek medical advice for liver issues. Common treatment options often include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Reducing alcohol intake.
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

2. **Medications:**
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or halt disease progression.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
