To determine the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement account that often comes with tax advantages. Contributions are typically pre-tax (lowering your taxable income).
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account that offers tax benefits. Contributions can be pre-tax (Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Regular investment accounts that don’t offer tax advantages but provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

2. **Determine Contribution Limits**:
   - Be aware of the maximum contribution limits for each account type. In 2023, the limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re over 50), while for IRAs, it’s $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50+).

3. **Prioritize Contributions**:
   - If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match—this is essentially free money.
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding your IRA, as it may offer more flexible investment options and potential tax benefits.
   - Finally, put any remaining funds into taxable accounts for additional growth and liquidity.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Assess your current and anticipated future tax situation. A Traditional IRA or 401(k) provides tax deferral, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts require careful consideration of capital gains taxes on investments.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep in mind the risk tolerance you're comfortable with and adjust your asset allocation accordingly.
   - It’s often advantageous to hold investments with high growth potential in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) and income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**:
   - Monitor and reassess your investment strategy regularly based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and strategic approach to distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
