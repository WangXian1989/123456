To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency:**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth based on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - **Utilize Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you've maxed out tax-deferred or tax-advantaged accounts, any additional savings can go into taxable accounts. This allows for easier access if needed and can be invested in a way that minimizes capital gains taxes (e.g., using tax-efficient funds).

2. **Investment Objectives:**
   - **Align Accounts with Goals:** Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term retirement goals, focusing on growth investments. Utilize your taxable accounts for shorter-term goals or scenarios where you may need the funds sooner.
   - **Diversification Across Account Types:** Maintain a balanced asset allocation across all accounts to prevent overexposure to any one asset class, helping manage risk.

By strategically allocating your money based on these considerations, you can maximize growth while managing tax implications effectively.
