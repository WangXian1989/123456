When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to understand the implications of each account type, including contribution limits, tax treatment, and your overall financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match for 401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize funding your 401(k) to at least the match limit. This is essentially free money for your retirement.

2. **Assess Contribution Limits:** For 2023, the contribution limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older)

   Make sure you're aware of these limits as they affect where you might want to allocate funds first.

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth)**, which affects your taxable income for the year. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, a traditional account may be more beneficial.
   - **Taxable accounts** allow for more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on any earnings. This can be a good place for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term investments.

4. **Diversify Investments:** Ensure you diversify your investments across all accounts, not just one. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets suited to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Emergency Fund and Short-Term Goals:** Make sure you have adequate liquidity for emergencies and short-term goals. This might mean prioritizing saving in taxable accounts or a high-yield savings account before fully funding retirement accounts.

6. **Long-Term Focus:** Remember that retirement accounts are often intended for long-term growth. If you can afford to lock away money until retirement, maximize contributions to these accounts.

7. **Review Regularly:** Periodically review your investment strategy and adjust it based on changes in income, financial goals, employment status, and market conditions.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific situation and goals.
