Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money. Consider maxing out your contributions if you can afford it, as this reduces your taxable income.
   - **IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to your IRA. If applicable, choose between a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) and a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - Taxable accounts may be preferred for investments you plan to access before retirement age or for investments that generate taxable income (like bonds). Strategies like holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates can be effective.

3. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to spread risk. Balancing your asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance is crucial.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement strategically: traditionally, it makes sense to withdraw from taxable accounts first (to minimize taxes and allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow) and then from tax-deferred accounts.

5. **Consider Fees and Investment Options:**
   - Evaluate the fees associated with your 401(k) compared to other accounts. Sometimes, IRAs or taxable accounts can offer better investment options or lower fees.

6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and adjust based on market conditions, changes in income, or life events.
