When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to factor in your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to at least receive the full match. This is essentially “free money” and helps grow your retirement savings significantly.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: After maximizing the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility). These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your investment growth over time.

3. **Consider Contribution Limits**: Keep in mind the contribution limits for 401(k)s and IRAs. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50), while the IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older).

4. **Funding Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional investing. These accounts offer more liquidity but come with capital gains taxes, so consider holding long-term investments to minimize taxable events.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Within these accounts, adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term retirement accounts like the 401(k) and IRA, a more aggressive portfolio may be suitable. In taxable accounts, consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting to manage taxes efficiently.

6. **Reassess Periodically**: Review your allocations and adjust them based on changes in income, financial goals, or market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your unique situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds across these various account types.
