When distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to consider factors like your financial goals, tax implications, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to optimize your allocations:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) first to benefit from pre-tax contributions, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing the 401(k) match (if applicable), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation.

3. **Consider Taxable Accounts Last**: Use these accounts for additional savings once you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Investments held in taxable accounts are subject to capital gains taxes.

4. **Invest for Growth in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on growth investments (like stocks) within your 401(k) and IRA, as these accounts allow for tax-free growth or tax-deferred growth.

5. **Use Taxable Accounts for Short-Term Goals**: If you need liquidity or have short-term financial goals, keep more conservative investments (like bonds or savings) in your taxable accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Assess your allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Estate Planning Considerations**: Think about your long-term plans and how each account fits into your estate strategy, as different accounts may have different implications for heirs.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your situation.
