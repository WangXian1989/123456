I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about common liver treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Avoiding alcohol 
   - Eating a balanced diet 
   - Regular exercise 

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may include antivirals for hepatitis or medications that reduce liver inflammation.

3. **Supplements**: Some people use milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but you should discuss this with your doctor first.

4. **Manage Underlying Conditions**: Treat conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol that may affect liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation.
