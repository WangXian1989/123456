Deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan often with matching contributions. Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Offers tax advantages for retirement savings. Traditional IRAs provide potential tax deductions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are regular investment accounts without special tax advantages. Suitable for short- to mid-term goals or investments you may need access to before retirement.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**:
   - Max out any employer match in your 401(k) first; itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - Then, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth, based on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, contribute to your taxable account.

### 3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Ensure your portfolio is diversified across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk effectively. 
   - Use tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts (like index funds or tax-managed funds) to mitigate tax liabilities.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from 401(k) and traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free in retirement if conditions are met.
   - Capital gains in taxable accounts can be taxed at capital gains rates, which may be lower than ordinary income rates. Utilize tax-loss harvesting strategies if necessary.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Stage**:
   - Your strategy may change based on your age, retirement timeline, and projected income. Younger investors may prioritize growth in riskier assets, while older investors may favor capital preservation.

### Final Thoughts:
Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on market performance, changes in income, and shifts in your financial goals. Consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice may also be beneficial.
