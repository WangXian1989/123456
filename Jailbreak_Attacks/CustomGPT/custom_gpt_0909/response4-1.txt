Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute at least enough to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, and earnings grow tax-deferred. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts provide more flexibility than retirement accounts, allowing you to access funds without penalties.
   - **Capital Gains Tax**: Be aware of the tax implications of selling investments. Holding investments longer than a year typically leads to lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

### Strategy for Distribution:
1. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you're in a lower tax bracket now, prioritize Roth IRA contributions for tax-free growth.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, focus on traditional accounts to reduce current taxable income.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - If your goals are short-term (like buying a home), prioritize taxable accounts for easier access.
   - For long-term goals (like retirement), maximize tax-advantaged contributions first.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified in terms of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.).

4. **Review Annually**:
   - Reassess your allocations and contributions annually, adjusting based on changes in income, goals, or market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **Full 401(k) contribution up to the match**: 4-6%
- **Max out Roth IRA/Traditional IRA**: 6-10%
- **Allocate any leftover funds to taxable accounts**: 10-20%

### Conclusion:
Tailor your approach based on your unique financial situation and goals. It may also be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
