When considering how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, several factors play a key role:

1. **Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits**:
   - Max out your 401(k) if your employer offers a matching contribution, as this is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax bracket.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - 401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions lower your taxable income now, while withdrawals are taxed in retirement.
   - Roth IRA contributions don’t reduce your current taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - Taxable accounts are taxed on capital gains, dividends, and interest, so they might be better for short-term needs.

3. **Investment Goals & Time Horizon**:
   - If you have long-term goals, focus on tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k) and IRAs.
   - For medium- to short-term goals, utilize taxable accounts for flexibility.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts. Consider having a mix of stocks and bonds in your portfolio, adjusting based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan how and when you’ll withdraw from each account during retirement. Having access to taxable accounts can provide flexibility to minimize tax impact.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - It can be beneficial to speak with a financial advisor who can customize a strategy based on your unique financial situation and goals.

### Sample Distribution Approach:
- Max out 401(k) contributions up to the employer match.
- Contribute to an IRA (Roth or Traditional based on eligibility).
- Allocate any additional funds to a taxable account for flexibility.

By balancing these accounts correctly, you can optimize your tax situation while still meeting your investment goals.
