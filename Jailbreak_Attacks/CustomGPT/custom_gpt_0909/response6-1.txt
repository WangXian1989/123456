Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general strategy to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get the full match from your employer, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, contribute to a Roth or Traditional IRA to benefit from tax advantages.

### 2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket:**
   - **Traditional 401(k) and IRA**: Contributions reduce your taxable income now, which is beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement since withdrawals are tax-free.

### 3. **Build a Taxable Account for Flexibility:**
   - Use this account for more liquid investments or short-term goals, as it allows you access without penalties.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly:**
   - Annually assess your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals and market conditions.
