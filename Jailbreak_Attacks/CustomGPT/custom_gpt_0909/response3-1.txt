The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts often depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" for your retirement.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but distributions will be taxed.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so they can be more efficient for short-term goals.

3. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA) to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Keep more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, especially if they produce taxable interest income.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.

5. **Investment Goals**: Align your distribution strategy with your timeline. If you plan to retire early, you may lean more towards IRAs and tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Review your account distributions regularly to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market changes.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your unique situation.
