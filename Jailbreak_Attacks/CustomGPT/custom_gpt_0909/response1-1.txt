Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; it's essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA)**: Good for high-income years, as contributions reduce taxable income now.
   - **Roth Accounts**: Ideal for younger individuals expecting higher income later, as withdrawals during retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Useful for flexibility, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Often limited in investment choices; aim for a diversified mix that aligns with your risk tolerance.
   - **IRA**: More flexibility; consider a diversified portfolio with stocks, bonds, and perhaps real estate.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for short-term savings, or if you want more access to funds without penalties.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan withdrawals based on tax implications in retirement; generally, it may be smarter to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then defer tax-deferred accounts as long as possible.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market performance, and retirement goals.
