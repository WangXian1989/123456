Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This offers an immediate return on your investment.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA or a Roth IRA, especially if you qualify for tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use traditional accounts (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA) for tax-deferred growth, while utilizing Roth accounts where you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term goals, as they provide more flexibility without penalties for withdrawals.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains.
   - Consider holding bonds or dividend-paying stocks in taxable accounts to manage tax implications effectively, as they may be taxed at lower capital gains rates.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations based on your financial goals, market conditions, and time horizon.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - They can offer personalized guidance based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and retirement objectives.

By balancing contributions and investments across these accounts, you can optimize your growth potential while managing tax liabilities.
