Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively hinges on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Employer Match:** Maximize contributions to your 401(k) first to take full advantage of any employer match, as itâ€™s essentially free money.
   - **IRA Contributions:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income and tax situation.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA):** These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement. Ideal for investors expecting to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. Best for those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later or looking for tax-free income.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for short-term goals or for funds you may need before retirement. They have no contribution limits but are subject to capital gains taxes on profits.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Depending on your risk tolerance and timeline, allocate your investments. Generally, higher-risk investments (like stocks) are suited for long-term retirement accounts, while lower-risk investments (like bonds) may be better for short-term taxable accounts.

### 4. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation. This may involve shifting assets between accounts based on performance and market conditions.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically during retirement to minimize taxes. For example, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

### Conclusion
Consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your circumstances, goals, and tax situation.
