Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match—it’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to your IRA (traditional or Roth) after maxing out your 401(k) match. IRAs often offer more investment options than 401(k)s.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional investments after you've maximized your contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Tax Efficiency**: Place investments expected to grow significantly in tax-advantaged accounts and hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider professional guidance to tailor a strategy specific to your situation.

This strategy can help you balance short-term access to funds with long-term growth and tax efficiency.
