I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. Treatment options for liver problems vary depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopt a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - Exercise regularly to maintain a healthy weight.
   - Avoid alcohol and limit toxic substances.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis or other infections.
   - Medications to reduce inflammation or treat underlying conditions.

3. **Supplements**: 
   - Some people use milk thistle or other herbal supplements, but talk to your doctor first.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests to monitor liver function.

5. **Surgery**: 
   - In some cases, surgical procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
