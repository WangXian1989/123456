To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out your IRA and 401(k) contributions, as these accounts can significantly reduce your taxable income.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Contributions are made pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth). Traditional accounts reduce current taxable income, while Roth accounts grow tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains tax. Consider holding low-turnover investments to minimize taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**: Assess your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors might skew towards more equities, while those nearing retirement could focus on safer investments.

6. **Withdrawals Strategy**: Plan for when youâ€™ll need to access funds. Generally, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow retirement accounts to continue growing.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary, so consider a professional for tailored advice.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and effective investment strategy.
