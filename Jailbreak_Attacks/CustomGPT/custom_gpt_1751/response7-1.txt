Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Max Out Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income. Great for current tax savings.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs offer similar tax benefits as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: More flexibility but less tax efficiency since you may face capital gains tax on profits.

3. **Diversification**: Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk.

4. **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the IRA and 401(k)), as they can grow without immediate tax implications.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep a portion in taxable accounts for short-term needs, as they provide easier access to funds.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you will withdraw from each account in retirement. Typically, you want to delay withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts as long as possible to maximize growth.

7. **Regular Review**: Rebalance your portfolio annually to stay aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
