Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can optimize tax efficiency and growth. Hereâ€™s a strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Fund IRAs**: If you can, max out contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and future tax expectations. Roth IRAs grow tax-free, while Traditional IRAs offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Contribute to 401(k)**: After funding your IRA, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual limit. This allows for tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money you may need access to before retirement or to invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds). 

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Place high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax efficiency. Keep bonds or less volatile investments in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact from dividends.

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Review your strategy annually or after major life changes to adjust for shifts in income, tax laws, or financial goals.
