Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing growth potential, tax implications, and your financial goals. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your 401(k) offers a match, contribute enough to get the full employer match first, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** After securing the match, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **Max Out IRAs:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions (both traditional and Roth, if eligible) for the year. This provides tax benefits whether you choose tax-deferred growth (traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).
   - **Continue 401(k) Contributions:** If you still have funds to allocate after your IRA, contribute further to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:** Once you have maximized contributions in tax-advantaged accounts, you can focus on taxable accounts. These can provide liquidity and flexibility, as they don't have the same withdrawal restrictions as retirement accounts.

4. **Investment Strategy:** Choose investments based on their tax efficiency:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer or shelter gains.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds) to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline:** The closer you are to retirement, the more conservative you might want to be. Shift funds accordingly to reduce risk as you approach your target retirement age.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor strategies to your individual circumstances and goals.
