Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: After the match, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k). Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, fund a Roth IRA for tax-free growth in retirement, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions if you meet income requirements.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Invest in taxable accounts for goals that may require accessing funds before retirement (e.g., buying a home, major purchases). Investments here can offer more liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance:
   - Consider placing high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to maximize tax-free growth.
   - Keep more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your financial situation evolves, regularly review and adjust your contributions among the accounts based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Understand the tax implications of withdrawals and capital gains. For example, withdrawals from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s are taxed as ordinary income, while long-term gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at a lower rate.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your unique circumstances.
