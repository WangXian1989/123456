When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match. This is free money and enhances your savings instantly.
   - **IRA:** Aim to max out contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Based on Tax Implications:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for short-term goals and investments that generate income taxed at higher rates (like dividends).
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA):** Ideal for long-term growth since you wonâ€™t pay taxes until withdrawal, typically at a lower income tax rate in retirement.

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Keep a balanced portfolio across all accounts. Include stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and consider REITs or other alternatives for income in taxable accounts.

### Additional Tips:
- **Review and Adjust:** Regularly assess the performance and allocation in each account to adjust for market changes or life events.
- **Investment Strategy Alignment:** Ensure that your asset allocation matches your risk tolerance and time horizon across all accounts. 

This holistic approach will help maximize growth potential while optimizing your tax situation over time.
