To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax deductions.

2. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Prioritize contributions to accounts that provide the most immediate tax benefit based on your current tax rate.
   - Consider your expected tax rate in retirement to determine if a Roth or Traditional account is more beneficial.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for longer-term investments with potential for growth (stocks, mutual funds).
   - Hold more conservative investments in taxable accounts to manage tax implications from capital gains distributions.

4. **Maintain Liquid Assets**:
   - Keep a portion of your funds in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term goals, as these accounts allow for easy access without penalties.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio allocations periodically to ensure they align with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Consider Fees and Expenses**:
   - Look for low-cost investment options in all accounts, but especially in your 401(k) and IRA, to maximize growth over time.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio.
