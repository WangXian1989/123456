When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: 
   - Maximize any employer match first. This is essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing enough to reach the maximum limit if possible. 401(k)s offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial over time.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. If you're aiming for tax-deferred growth, a traditional IRA can be a good choice.
   - Aim for the annual contribution limit if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maxing out your 401(k) and IRA, use taxable accounts to invest in assets that may generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments; index funds and ETFs are typically more tax-efficient than actively managed funds.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographies, considering your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - In retirement, have a plan for where to withdraw funds first (e.g., taxable accounts first to let tax-advantaged accounts continue to grow).
