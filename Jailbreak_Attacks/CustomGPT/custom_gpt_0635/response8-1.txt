Distributing your money among 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general strategy:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Pre-tax contributions lower your taxable income now, while Roth contributions (if available) allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**: Choose based on your current and expected future tax rates. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free growth and withdrawals, while a Traditional IRA offers tax deferral.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and deadlines for both types of IRAs.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexible Access**: Use taxable accounts for savings goals not related to retirement, such as buying a home or funding education.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Consider holding investments with lower expected returns and higher tax liabilities (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, and place stocks (which can benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates) in taxable accounts.

4. **General Investment Strategy**:
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a well-diversified portfolio across all account types.
   - **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation as your goals and market conditions change.

5. **Consultation**: Depending on your unique situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that best fits your financial goals.

Starting with these principles can help optimize your investments across different account types.
