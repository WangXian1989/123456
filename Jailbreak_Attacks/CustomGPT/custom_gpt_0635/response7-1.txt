When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to help you develop an effective strategy:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money. Furthermore, consider maximizing your contribution limits if your budget allows.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** After maxing out your 401(k) match, focusing on your IRA is a good next step. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA allows for tax-deductible contributions.

2. **Consider Taxation:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Contributions to your 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income in the year you contribute, allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth Accounts:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, which can be beneficial in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts are taxed annually on dividends and capital gains. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals, making them useful for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Diversification and Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across different asset classes within each account according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, long-term accounts (like a 401(k) or IRA) can take on more risk than a taxable account for short-term needs.

4. **Review and Adjust Annually:**
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and re-balance as needed based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

5. **Consider Professional Advice:**
   - If you are unsure about your strategy, it might be worthwhile to consult a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

By strategically allocating your resources, you can maximize the growth potential of your investments while minimizing your tax liabilities.
