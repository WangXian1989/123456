Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is free money and a great start.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit, particularly if you have high-income years since contributions may lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, or a traditional IRA if you want to reduce your taxable income now.

3. **Assess Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider building your taxable accounts. Investments in taxable accounts can provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Generally, consider:
   - Growth-oriented investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-deferred growth.
   - Income-generating investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts, as they might be taxed at a lower capital gains rate.

5. **Rebalance and Review**: Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on life changes or market conditions.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
