Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can maximize your returns and minimize tax implications. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**  
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as that’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible (the annual limit is $22,500 for 2024, plus $7,500 if you're 50 or older).
   - **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deduction opportunities.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts**  
   - Once you’ve contributed as much as possible to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider using taxable accounts for additional investments. These can be useful for short-term goals or for investments that might lead to capital gains, which are typically taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 3. **Asset Allocation**  
   - Within these accounts, consider your investment strategy. Generally, stocks perform better over the long term than bonds, so they can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Fixed income and bond funds can be better suited for taxable accounts, as they may generate interest that is taxed at your ordinary income rate.

### 4. **Reassess and Adjust**  
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust as needed based on changes in your financial situation, investment goals, and market conditions.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.

### Summary 
Focus on maximizing your 401(k) and IRA contributions first, then allocate any extra funds to taxable accounts while considering the type of assets in each. Regular reviews are essential for long-term success.

If you have specific goals or timelines (like retirement age), or need to consider your risk tolerance, I can provide more tailored advice.
