Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: Once youâ€™ve maximized your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA offers tax deductions upfront.

3. **Back to the 401(k)**: If you still have room in your budget and your 401(k) plan allows, continue contributing to your 401(k) until you reach the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate taxable income or for money you might need before retirement. This can include stocks or mutual funds that are more tax-efficient.

5. **Investment Types**: In your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA), consider holding investments with higher growth potential, as the tax benefits are maximized. In taxable accounts, focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, which tend to generate less taxable income.

6. **Adjust for Taxes**: Be aware of your tax bracket and how it may change in retirement. Consider tax-loss harvesting in your taxable accounts to offset gains.

7. **Regular Rebalance**: Review and rebalance your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

8. **Consult a Professional**: It might also be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor advice to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
