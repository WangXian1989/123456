When it comes to distributing your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider, such as your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and investment strategies. Here's a general approach:

1. **Max out employer match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, be sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money!

2. **Tax-advantaged accounts:** Focus on contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts can help reduce your taxable income now (401(k)) or provide tax-free growth (Roth IRA) depending on the type of IRA you choose.

3. **Emergency fund:** Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a high-yield savings account or easily accessible account before focusing too much on investing.

4. **Debt management:** Pay off high-interest debts before aggressively investing, as the interest on those debts can outweigh potential investment returns.

5. **Taxable account:** After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider putting any additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes.

6. **Diversification:** Make sure your overall investment strategy across all accounts is diversified. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

7. **Consult a professional:** If you’re really unsure, speaking to a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.

Keep in mind that these are general guidelines, and you may need to adjust based on your personal goals and circumstances!
