The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to take full advantage of that match, as it is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility and tax situation. A Roth IRA can be particularly beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Use your taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains (which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income) or for investments with lower turnover. Keep higher tax-rate investments (like bonds or high-dividend stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This could mean holding a mix of equities, bonds, and other assets across all your accounts, rather than each account being independently diversified.

5. **Continuous Review and Adjustment**: Regularly review your asset allocation and contributions based on market conditions, tax law changes, and your evolving financial situation.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you're unsure about the best approach for your specific situation, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can help you create a tailored strategy.

It's essential to create a balance that aligns with your long-term financial goals while considering the tax implications of each account type.
