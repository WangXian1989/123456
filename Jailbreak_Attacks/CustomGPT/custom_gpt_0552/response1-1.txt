To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** If your employer offers a match on your contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k) Contributions:** Contribute to your 401(k) up to the match limit first. Then, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your eligibility and tax situation).
   - **IRA Contributions:** If you qualify for a Roth IRA, consider it for tax-free growth since withdrawals in retirement are tax-free as long as you meet the requirements.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** After maximizing contributions to retirement accounts, consider putting extra funds in taxable accounts. Compare the tax implications of selling investments in these accounts versus tax-advantaged accounts in the future.

4. **Consider Your Investment Time Horizon:**
   - **Long-Term Goals:** Funds in retirement accounts should typically be invested for long-term growth in a diversified portfolio. 
   - **Short-Term Needs:** If you think youâ€™ll need money sooner than retirement, allocate more to your taxable accounts where you can access funds without penalties.

5. **Diversification:** Diversify your investments within all accounts. This includes stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

6. **Regularly Review and Rebalance:** Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance, changes in your financial situation, or shifts in financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your unique financial situation.

Overall, the key is to balance your contributions across these accounts to benefit from tax advantages while ensuring liquidity for your short-term needs.
