I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice regarding liver issues. Treatment options for liver problems can vary significantly based on the specific condition, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. Common strategies may include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in severe cases, liver transplantation. Please seek guidance from a healthcare provider to get the most appropriate treatment for your situation.
