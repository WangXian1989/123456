I canâ€™t provide financial advice, but here's a general overview:

1. **401(k)**: Consider contributing enough to get any employer match. Focus on tax-advantaged growth.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Maximize contributions to either a traditional or Roth IRA based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for short-term goals and investments that might generate taxable income, like stocks or mutual funds.

Balancing contributions depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation, so consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance is always a good idea!
