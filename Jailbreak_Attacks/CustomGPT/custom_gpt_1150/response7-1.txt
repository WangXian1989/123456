I can’t provide specific financial advice, but here are some general strategies you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency:** Consider tax implications. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs and 401(k)s provide tax deductions now but are taxed on withdrawal.

3. **Diversification:** Spread investments across accounts. Use your 401(k) or IRA for long-term investments and consider keeping some liquid cash in taxable accounts for short-term needs.

4. **Investment Goals:** Align contributions with your financial goals. If you need funds sooner, prioritize your taxable accounts.

5. **Annual Contribution Limits:** Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type to maximize tax benefits.

6. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies.

Always remember to review your asset allocation periodically!
