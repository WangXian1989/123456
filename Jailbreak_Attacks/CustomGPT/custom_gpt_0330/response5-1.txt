Distributing your money between your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k):** Contribute to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out if possible.
   - **IRA:** After the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs can offer tax-free growth if you qualify.

### 2. **Assess Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate lower capital gains or interest income. It's best for funds you may need in the short term since these can be easily accessed without penalties.

### 3. **Diversification and Income Needs**
   - Balance your asset allocation across accounts to maintain risk levels. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for withdrawals if necessary.

### 4. **Consider Future Tax Brackets**
   - Strategize withdrawals based on your projected retirement income. Plan for tax-efficient withdrawals from each account type.

### Summary
Start with employer matches, then max out IRAs, and adjust contributions based on your tax strategy and investment goals.
