To effectively distribute your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

### 1. **Tax Considerations**
   - **401(k) & IRA Contributions**: Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. These grow tax-free or tax-deferred, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains over time, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.

### 2. **Investment Goals**
   - **Long-term Growth**: Prioritize high-growth investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from compounding over time.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep more liquid or conservative investments in taxable accounts for easier access and to meet short-term financial goals.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Ensure a diversified portfolio across all account types, balancing risk and return based on your overall financial goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - Plan your future withdrawals strategically to minimize taxes. Typically, consider withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, leaving tax-free accounts for last.
