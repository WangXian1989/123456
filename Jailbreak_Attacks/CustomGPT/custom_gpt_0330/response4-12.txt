I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options typically include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise can significantly impact liver health.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, or treat underlying causes may be prescribed.

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to track the condition's progression.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Abstaining from alcohol is crucial for liver recovery and health.

5. **Managing Underlying Conditions**: Treating conditions like hepatitis, diabetes, or obesity can improve liver function.

6. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant might be necessary.
