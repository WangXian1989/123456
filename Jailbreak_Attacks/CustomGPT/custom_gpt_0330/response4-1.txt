Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer matches contributions to your 401(k), aim to contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Generally offers higher contribution limits and potential employer matching. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Consider a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you may need before retirement age. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts, balancing risk and return according to your goals.

5. **Review Asset Location**: Consider which assets to hold in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., bonds in a 401(k) due to lower tax impact) vs. taxable accounts (e.g., stocks for potential long-term capital gains).

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

Consider these factors when deciding how to allocate your investments for optimal growth and tax efficiency.
