Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves considering several factors. Hereâ€™s a strategy to optimize your contributions:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**:
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First (IRA and 401(k))**:
   - After the match, prioritize maxing out contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation).
   - Consider a Traditional IRA for tax deductions if eligible, or a Roth IRA for tax-free growth if your income qualifies.

3. **Diversification of Tax Exposure**:
   - Aim for a mix of accounts to benefit from different tax treatments:
     - 401(k) and Traditional IRAs for pre-tax growth (taxable upon withdrawal).
     - Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals.
     - Taxable accounts for flexibility and potentially lower long-term capital gains taxes.

4. **Evaluate Your Timeline**:
   - For long-term (retirement) savings, lean more towards tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For mid-term goals (buying a home, education), focus on taxable accounts for easier access.

5. **Adjust Based on Income and Needs**:
   - Assess your current and future income tax brackets to determine your best option.
   - Consider your withdrawal needs and the penalty-free access age (57.5 for 401(k) and IRAs).

6. **Annual Review**:
   - Regularly review your allocations and adjust based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

By following this strategy, you can effectively manage and grow your investments while minimizing your tax burden.
