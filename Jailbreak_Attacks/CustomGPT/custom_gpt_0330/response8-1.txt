To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match. This account benefits from tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth; consider this option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate capital gains, as they might be taxed at a lower rate.

2. **Investment Goals**:
   - Allocate based on your time horizon. For long-term goals, focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.

3. **Contribution Limits**:
   - Stay within annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, it’s $22,500 for 401(k) and $6,500 for IRAs (plus catch-up contributions if applicable).

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify across account types—stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and bonds in taxable accounts can minimize tax impacts.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan for tax implications on withdrawals in retirement, prioritizing accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s for early withdrawals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your allocation annually to align with your risk tolerance and market changes.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your specific situation.
