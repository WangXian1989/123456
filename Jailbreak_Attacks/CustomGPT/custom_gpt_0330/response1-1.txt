Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves balancing tax efficiency, liquidity, and investment goals. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Allocate to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - After maxing out the 401(k) match, consider maximizing contributions to an IRA (traditional or Roth) based on your income and tax situation.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest any additional funds in taxable accounts. This provides liquidity and easier access to your money without penalties.

4. **Asset Location**:
   - Place high-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes.
   - Use taxable accounts for more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or municipal bonds).

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
