Î± When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, the best approach depends on your individual financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here are a few guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize your employer match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), make sure to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level and the type of IRA (traditional vs. Roth), you could gain tax advantages now or in the future.

3. **Allocate to taxable accounts wisely**: Once youâ€™ve maxed out contributions to your retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA), you can start investing in taxable accounts. Keep in mind that you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits, so consider investing in tax-efficient funds.

4. **Long-term growth vs. accessibility**: Consider your time horizon for each account type. Retirement accounts typically have penalties for early withdrawals, so ensure you have sufficient liquid assets in taxable accounts for emergencies or short-term needs.

5. **Regularly review and rebalance**: As your financial situation changes or as you approach retirement, regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
