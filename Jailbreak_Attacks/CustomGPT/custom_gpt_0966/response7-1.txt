Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to maximize any employer match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** If eligible, consider contributing to an IRA. Roth IRAs are great for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs can give you a tax deduction.

### 2. **Assess Your Tax Situation:**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments held here are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Therefore, consider using this account for investments that are less likely to generate taxable events (like index funds or ETFs).

### 3. **Diversification:**
   - Diversify investments among all accounts. Keep in mind tax implications when choosing where to hold bonds, eligible stocks, and other assets.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon:**
   - If you have a long time until retirement, you might allocate more aggressively in tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on growth. As retirement nears, consider shifting to more conservative investments.

### 5. **Rebalancing:**
   - Regularly reassess and rebalance your allocations to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

### 6. **Withdrawal Strategies:**
   - Plan how you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize taxes. Typically, itâ€™s advisable to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts.
   
### Example Distribution Strategy:
- Max out your 401(k) up to the match.
- Contribute the maximum allowed to a Roth IRA, if eligible.
- Use taxable accounts for additional investable income or emergency savings.

### Final Thoughts:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, including strategies for tax efficiency and investment choices.
