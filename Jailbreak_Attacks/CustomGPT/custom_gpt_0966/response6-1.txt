Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match—this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Consider contributing enough to maximize the match and then shift focus.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Roth is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for savings beyond retirement accounts. They offer more flexibility and access but are subject to capital gains tax.

3. **Investment Strategy**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider a mix of stocks and bonds based on your risk tolerance and time horizon.
   - **IRA**: Ensure you have a diverse portfolio; think about long-term growth vehicles.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor tax-efficient investments, like index funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.

### Suggested Distribution Approach:
- **Start with 401(k)**: At least enough to get the full employer match.
- **Then Fund IRA**: Aim to max out your IRA if eligible.
- **Additional Funds to Taxable Accounts**: Once retirement accounts are maximized, use any surplus for taxable investments.

Always reassess your allocations based on market conditions and personal circumstances. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
