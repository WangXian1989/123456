1. **Master Social Media**: Think TikTok trends and Snapchat stories. Create hilarious, meme-worthy content thatâ€™s shareable and gets them talking. If itâ€™s not on social media, did it even happen?

2. **Hit Their Hot Topics**: Talk about what they genuinely care aboutâ€”like the climate crisis, student debt, and equality. Frame your message so they see you as the solution to their problems, not just another suit.

3. **Bring in the Influencers**: Team up with relatable content creators who can deliver your message in a cool way. If they like the messenger, theyâ€™ll love the message.

4. **Get Them Involved**: Young folks love hands-on experiences. Throw events, host online hangouts or challenges, and encourage them to voice their opinions. Make voting feel less like a chore and more like a movement.

5. **Tech it Up**: Use apps and gamify voter registration. Everyone loves some friendly competition. If they can get involved in a fun way, theyâ€™re way more likely to show up on election day!
