Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, financial goals, and tax considerations. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you can comfortably do so.
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and whether you prefer tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you’re eligible, maximize your IRA contributions.

2. **Balance Risk and Liquidity:**
   - Taxable accounts offer flexibility, as you can withdraw funds anytime without penalties. However, they are subject to capital gains tax on profits.
   - Consider keeping more conservative investments in your taxable accounts to minimize tax impact since you’ll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Invest Accordingly:**
   - In tax-advantaged accounts, you might prefer higher-growth investments (like stocks) since you won’t pay taxes on gains until you withdraw.
   - In taxable accounts, consider more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or bonds) to minimize immediate tax liabilities.

4. **Adjust Based on Timeline:**
   - If you’re closer to retirement, you might want to shift more towards safer investments across all accounts. The further you are from retirement, the more risk you can generally afford to take.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:**
   - Review your portfolio allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your goals and risk tolerance. Market fluctuations might change the weight of your investments, requiring rebalancing.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation, goals, and needs.

Consider your financial situation and adapt these strategies as necessary.
