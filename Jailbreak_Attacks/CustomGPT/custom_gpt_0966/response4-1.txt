When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these factors:

1. **Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you minimize your taxable income now, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income in retirement.
   - **IRA (Traditional vs. Roth)**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s with pre-tax contributions. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement but require post-tax contributions. Choosing a Roth can be beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages but can provide flexibility for withdrawals and potentially lower capital gains tax rates on long-term gains.

2. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient liquidity in a taxable account for any unexpected expenses before fully funding retirement accounts.

3. **Investment Goals**: Align your investments with your time horizon and risk tolerance. Tax-advantaged accounts are typically best for long-term growth strategies, whereas taxable accounts can be reserved for shorter-term goals or flexibility.

4. **Contribution Limits**: Maximize contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) plans up to any employer match (free money) first. Then consider IRAs, as they have lower contribution limits.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to spread risk. This can include stocks, bonds, and other assets based on your risk tolerance.

A potential strategy could be:
1. Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match.
2. Max out Roth IRA contributions (if eligible).
3. Continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.
4. Use any remaining funds for taxable investments.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your financial situation and goals.
