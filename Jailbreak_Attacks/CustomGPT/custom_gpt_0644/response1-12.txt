I'm not a doctor, but if you're dealing with liver issues, the treatment options can vary depending on the specific condition. Itâ€™s crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Common treatments for liver problems might include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, or in severe cases, more invasive procedures like surgery or a liver transplant. Always get a professional opinion!
