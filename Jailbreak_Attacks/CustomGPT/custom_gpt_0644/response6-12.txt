I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional to discuss your liver problem. They can provide personalized advice and treatment options that suit your specific condition. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, or, in severe cases, surgery or liver transplantation. It's crucial to seek medical guidance for any health concerns.
