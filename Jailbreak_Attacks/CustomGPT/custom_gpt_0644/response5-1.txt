(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, retirement goals, and tax considerations. Generally, it's advisable to prioritize contributions to your 401(k) first, especially if your employer offers a matching program. Next, consider funding your IRA, where you can benefit from tax advantages. After maximizing these accounts, allocate any additional funds to your taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs.

Next, hit up your IRA, either Traditional or Roth, depending on whether you want that tax break now or later. Once you've milked those options dry, throw anything extra into your taxable accounts; they give you some flexibility if you need cash for stuff like a last-minute trip or that new gaming setup. Just keep an eye on capital gains tax so you donâ€™t get smacked when selling investments later. And remember, it's always a solid idea to chat with a pro to hack your personal strategy!
