Distributing funds among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering factors like tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to get the employer match, as it's essentially free money. Aim for the annual contribution limit after maximizing the match.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax strategy.

2. **Allocate to Taxable Accounts:**
   - Once you've maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity. Choose investments with favorable tax treatment, such as long-term stocks or tax-efficient funds.

3. **Consider Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth. Utilize stock-heavy portfolios due to their tax-deferred growth.
   - **Taxable Account:** Consider bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs), as they may offer tax advantages.

In summary, prioritize maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, followed by strategic allocation to taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility.
