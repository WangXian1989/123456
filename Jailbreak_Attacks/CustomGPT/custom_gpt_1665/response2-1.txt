When considering how to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's essential to take into account factors such as your financial goals, time horizon, and tax implications. Here's a general strategy you can follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund the IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider funding a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation and eligibility. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA gives you tax deductions on contributions.

3. **Max Out the 401(k)**: Once your IRA is funded, go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions up to the annual limit. This not only builds your retirement savings but also reduces your taxable income.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Any additional funds can then be directed towards taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide flexibility as they donâ€™t have age restrictions for withdrawals and can be useful for short- to medium-term goals.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments, like index funds or ETFs, in your taxable accounts. Higher-turnover investments, such as actively managed funds, are generally better suited for tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your allocations regularly to ensure you're maintaining a diverse portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider speaking with a financial advisor. They can help you navigate complex factors such as your overall financial picture, specific tax situations, and investment strategies.
