The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), aim to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of this match. It’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRAs**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA after maximizing your 401(k) match. These accounts offer tax advantages that can benefit your long-term savings.

3. **Max Out 401(k)**: After meeting your IRA contributions, if you still have the ability to save more, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts for additional savings. This can be especially useful for short-term goals or for funds you may want to access before retirement age without penalties.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Regardless of the account type, ensure your investments are diversified among various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate to manage risk effectively.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of each account type. For example, withdrawing from taxable accounts can result in capital gains taxes, while withdrawing from IRAs and 401(k)s typically incurs ordinary income tax.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on your financial goals, performance of the investments, and changes in your personal/financial situation.
