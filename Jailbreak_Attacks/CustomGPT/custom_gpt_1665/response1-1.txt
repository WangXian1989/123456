To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some steps and considerations:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:** 
   - **401(k):** Check the annual contribution limit for your 401(k) plan. For 2023, it's $22,500, or $30,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - **IRA:** The contribution limit for IRAs is $6,500, or $7,500 if you're 50 or older.

2. **Employer Match:** 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution in your 401(k), prioritize contributing enough to get the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** These accounts grow tax-deferred, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal, which usually happens in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Gains and dividends are taxed in the year they occur, so consider using these for investments that generate less frequent capital gains or for investments that can benefit from tax-lot strategies.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon:** 
   - Determine your investment goals (retirement, home purchase, etc.) and consider the timeline until you'll need the money. Longer timelines typically allow you to take more risks.

5. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance. Allocate more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) where they can grow tax-free for a longer time.

6. **Withdrawals:**
   - Consider your expected withdrawals in retirement. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, while 401(k) and IRAs typically have restrictions.

7. **Review Regularly:**
   - Your financial situation and goals can change, so it's important to review your strategy regularly and adjust your contributions and allocations as necessary.

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- What are your current asset allocations, and what are your financial goals?
- Are you currently taking full advantage of any employer matches in your 401(k)?
- What is your age and risk tolerance for investing?
