Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match. It's essentially free money.

2. **Fund IRAs**: After the employer match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth) based on your eligibility. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may produce taxable income, like bonds or frequent trading. This can also be a good place for investments held for shorter periods.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: Keep in mind the tax implications of withdrawals. Tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k)s and IRAs) typically have penalties for early withdrawals, while taxable accounts do not.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, adjusting asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure regular check-ins and adjustments based on market performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a plan specific to your situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money effectively for long-term growth and security.
