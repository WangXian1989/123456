Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider funding a traditional or Roth IRA next. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**: After maximizing your IRA contribution, continue to increase your 401(k) contributions, especially if you can still benefit from tax deferral.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you still have funds available, consider investing in a taxable account. This can provide liquidity and flexibility for short-term goals.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across accounts to manage risk. 

6. **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and higher tax-burden investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your strategy annually to accommodate changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consult a financial advisor to personalize this strategy based on your individual circumstances.
