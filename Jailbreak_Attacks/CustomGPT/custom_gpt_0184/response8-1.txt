Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Depending on your income, consider contributing to a traditional IRA (pre-tax) or a Roth IRA (after-tax for tax-free withdrawals). Aim to max out contributions if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts. This is useful for flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify across all accounts. Typically, higher-risk investments can go into taxable accounts for tax-loss harvesting benefits, while more stable investments may fit better in retirement accounts.

5. **Withdrawals and Taxes**: Plan your withdrawals carefully, especially considering tax implications. Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue compounding.

6. **Review Regularly**: Regularly assess your investment allocation and adjust based on your changing financial situation and goals.

Consult with a financial advisor to tailor your strategy to your specific needs.
