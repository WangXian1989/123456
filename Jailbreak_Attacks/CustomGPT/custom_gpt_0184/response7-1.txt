Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or after-tax (Roth), providing tax advantages either now or in retirement.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Flexible Contributions**: Contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged savings. Choose between traditional (tax-deductible) and Roth (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current tax bracket and expected retirement income.
   - **Diversification**: Use IRAs to invest in a wider range of assets that may not be available in a 401(k).

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity**: Keep funds here for short-term goals or emergencies, as these accounts are not tax-advantaged.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Focus on investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds or municipal bonds), and consider tax-loss harvesting strategies.

### Suggested Distribution Strategy:
- **Prioritize 401(k) contributions** up to the employer match.
- **Maximize IRA contributions** next, depending on tax advantages.
- **Allocate excess funds to taxable accounts** for liquidity and flexibility.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Age and Proximity to Retirement**: Younger investors may lean more heavily into equities, while those closer to retirement may prefer bonds and stable investments.
- **Tax Considerations**: Consult a financial advisor for personalized tax strategies.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation and goals evolve.
