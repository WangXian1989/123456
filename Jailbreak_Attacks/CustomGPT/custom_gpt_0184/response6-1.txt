To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, then max out your IRA contributions. This optimizes tax benefits and potential growth.
   - **Consider Tax Brackets**: If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later, prioritize pre-tax contributions (401(k), traditional IRA).

### 2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on equities in your retirement accounts for potential compounding. Consider bonds or stable assets in taxable accounts for lower tax impact.
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep cash or conservative assets in taxable accounts to maintain liquidity.

### 3. **Diversification**
   - **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio within each account type, adjusting based on risk tolerance.
   - **Rebalance Regularly**: Ensure your overall allocation aligns with your financial goals.

### 4. **Withdrawal Strategy**
   - **Order of Withdrawals**: Plan your withdrawals carefully in retirement to minimize taxes, starting with taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - **Personalized Strategy**: A professional can help create a tailored plan based on your unique financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors, you can strategically distribute your money across different accounts for maximum long-term benefits.
