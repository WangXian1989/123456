To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if your employer matches.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deductible contributions.
  
3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments you might need to access before retirement, and consider tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your investment strategy annually or after major life changes to ensure alignment with your goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insights based on your specific situation.
