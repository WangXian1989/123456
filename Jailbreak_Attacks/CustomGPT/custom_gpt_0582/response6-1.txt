To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Evaluate the Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your current taxable income. Consider maximizing employer matching contributions, as this is effectively free money.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s a Roth or traditional IRA, contributions may be made pre-tax or after-tax, influencing your tax situation now and in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Gains in these accounts are subject to capital gains tax. Utilize strategies like tax-loss harvesting to minimize tax liability.

2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match in 401(k)**: This is often the first step, as it provides an immediate return on investment.
   - **Contribute to IRA**: Provided you’re eligible, consider funding a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, focusing on the one that fits your tax strategy.
   - **Fund Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, allocate excess funds to taxable accounts for more flexible access and investment choices.

3. **Investment Considerations:**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust the type of investments (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance within each account.
   - **Time Horizon**: Align investments to match your retirement timeline. Longer horizons can accommodate more aggressive investments.

4. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure a balanced investment strategy that spreads risk across different asset classes, leveraging the unique tax advantages of each account type.

This multi-faceted approach will help optimize growth while maintaining a strategic tax framework for your retirement savings. Always consult with a financial advisor to align your specific situation with general guidelines.
