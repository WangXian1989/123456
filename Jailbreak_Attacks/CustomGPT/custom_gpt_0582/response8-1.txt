The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, current income, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be a beneficial option.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
     - If using a Traditional IRA, contributions may also be tax-deductible. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
     - If using a Roth IRA, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This could be valuable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.
3. **Consider Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Taxable accounts don’t have contribution limits or withdrawal penalties, allowing for more flexibility in accessing funds if needed.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes on investments held in taxable accounts.
   
4. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and investment horizon, ensure your investments are balanced across all accounts. You might choose to hold more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments in taxable accounts.
   
5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider how and when you’ll need to access your funds. For instance, if you have a specific short-term goal, a taxable account might be more appropriate.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A personal finance professional can provide tailored advice based on your specific financial situation.

Ultimately, the right distribution will vary by individual circumstances, so regularly reviewing your strategy and adjusting as needed is important.
