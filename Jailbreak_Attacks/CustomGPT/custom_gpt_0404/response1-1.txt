To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: First, be aware of the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k) (or $30,000 if you're over 50) and $6,500 to an IRA (or $7,500 if you're over 50).

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, always contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

3. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. This is advantageous if you're in a higher tax bracket now, but distributions will be taxed in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, but taxable upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making it a great choice if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These allow for more flexibility but come with capital gains taxes on earnings and dividends. They can be beneficial for shorter-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Diversify your investments across accounts. Consider holding more tax-efficient investments like index funds and ETFs in taxable accounts, while putting tax-inefficient investments like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Keep in mind your cash flow and liquidity needs. Taxable accounts can provide quicker access to funds compared to retirement accounts, which may have penalties for early withdrawal.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly reassess and rebalance your portfolio to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Long-Term Goals**: Your investment strategy should align with your long-term financial goals, such as retirement age, desired lifestyle, and other financial obligations.

Each person's financial situation is unique, so it may be beneficial to consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
