To provide the best strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, ensure you contribute at least enough to receive that full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Debt and Emergency Fund**: Before directing additional funds into retirement accounts, make sure you have a solid emergency fund and that high-interest debts are paid down, as the financial security of those areas can provide a foundation for long-term investing.

3. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the employer match, contribute up to the maximum limit you are comfortable with, benefiting from potential tax deferral.

4. **IRA Contributions**: If you are eligible, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Generally, contributing to a Roth IRA is advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you have maximized the benefits from your 401(k) and IRA, you can start contributing to taxable investment accounts. These accounts provide flexibility for both short-term and long-term investment goals and allow for more diverse investment options.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Consider the investment type in each account. For instance, place higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts (like your 401(k) and IRA) to maximize the tax benefits, while considering tax-efficient investments for your taxable accounts.

7. **Revisit Annually**: Regularly review your investment distribution and adjust according to changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Ultimately, the specific percentages and amounts will depend on your unique financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. It may be prudent to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
