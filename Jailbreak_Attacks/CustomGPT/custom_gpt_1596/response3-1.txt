Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Sponsored by your employer, often with matching contributions. Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** Offers tax advantages. You can choose between Traditional (tax-deferred) or Roth (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax. These are more flexible for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max out 401(k) contributions first:** Especially if your employer offers matching. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Roth or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation.
   - **Taxable accounts for flexibility:** Use these for money you might need sooner or for investments not suitable inside retirement accounts.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible now but taxed upon withdrawal.**
   - **Roth IRA contributions are after-tax, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.**
   - **Taxable accounts incur capital gains tax upon sale.**

### 4. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **Use tax-advantaged accounts for high-growth investments:** Such as stocks, since growth is taxed less aggressively.
   - **Hold more stable investments in taxable accounts:** Such as bonds or real estate investment trusts (REITs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Life Changes:**
   - Reevaluate your distribution as your income and life situations change (e.g., marriage, home purchase, retirement).

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Personal circumstances vary. A financial advisor can help tailor a plan specific to your needs.

### Conclusion:
A good approach is to maximize contributions to your 401(k), then your IRA, and finally use any excess funds for a taxable account while considering your overall financial goals and tax situation.
