Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here's a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Fund an IRA**: Consider funding a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are generally advantageous for younger investors who expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**: After maxing out your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) until you reach the contribution limit. This can be particularly beneficial if your 401(k) has lower fees than your IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you’ve contributed to your retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable account for more flexible access to your funds. This allows for withdrawals without penalties, though you’ll owe taxes on gains.

5. **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds within your taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. Municipal bonds or index funds can be good choices.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your distributions and allocate your assets based on your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Adjust as necessary to maintain a diversified portfolio.

Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your specific circumstances.
