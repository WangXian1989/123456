Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match before putting money elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After securing the match, consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you can. This gives you tax-deferred growth.

3. **IRA Contributions**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. This is useful for funds you might need access to before retirement.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across all accounts. Keep more volatile investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on capital gains, while holding more stable investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

7. **Consider Taxes**: Be mindful of tax implications for withdrawals. Generally, it might be more beneficial to withdraw from tax-deferred accounts last.

This is a general strategy; consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your specific circumstances.
