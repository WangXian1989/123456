Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Traditional vs. Roth Accounts:**
   - If you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial. Conversely, if you're looking for immediate tax deductions, consider traditional IRA contributions.

3. **Diversify Investments:**
   - Within each account type, ensure a diversified investment strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

4. **Prioritize Debt Repayment:**
   - If you have high-interest debt, consider paying that off before investing significantly in your accounts.

5. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility:**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that might need to be accessed before retirement. These accounts can provide liquidity without early withdrawal penalties.

6. **Consider Contribution Limits:**
   - Be aware of contribution limits for each account. In 2024, the contribution limit for 401(k) plans is $23,000, and for IRAs, it's $6,500.

7. **Review Tax Implications:**
   - Keep an eye on capital gains taxes and the potential impact of withdrawals from taxable accounts.

8. **Adjust as Needed:**
   - Regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

9. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - Consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor a plan to your specific circumstances and long-term objectives.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your money across these important accounts.
