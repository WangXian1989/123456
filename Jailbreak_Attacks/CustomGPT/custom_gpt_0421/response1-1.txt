Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

2. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you're in a higher tax bracket now, a Traditional IRA or 401(k) may be more beneficial since contributions are tax-deductible.
   - If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth account might be preferable.

3. **Emergency Savings**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity outside of retirement accounts for emergencies. This might mean keeping some funds in a taxable account until you're financially secure.

4. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - If you're saving for long-term goals (like retirement), prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Ideally, you should aim for a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, you might lean more towards taxable accounts since they allow for easier access to funds.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**:
   - Consider placing higher growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax on capital gains. In taxable accounts, keep more conservative investments (like bonds) which are usually taxed at ordinary income rates.

6. **Regular Review**:
   - Regularly review your investment allocations and account contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your unique situation.
