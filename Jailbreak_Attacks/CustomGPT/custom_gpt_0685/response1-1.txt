Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach you might consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider IRA Contributions**: If you qualify, consider funding a Roth IRA first for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your income and tax situation.

3. **Fund the 401(k)**: After maximizing any IRA contributions, go back to your 401(k) and contribute beyond the match, especially if it has a wide range of investment options with low fees.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: If you have additional funds, consider opening a taxable investment account for more liquidity. This can be useful for short-term goals or if you anticipate needing to access funds sooner.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally:
   - **Long-Term (Retirement)**: Focus on growth-oriented assets in 401(k) and IRA accounts.
   - **Mid-Term**: Balance between stocks and bonds in taxable accounts.
   - **Short-Term**: Keep more liquid assets like cash or cash equivalents.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep tax implications in mind:
   - Taxable accounts will incur capital gains taxes.
   - 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions may reduce taxable income today.

7. **Review Regularly**: Revisit your allocation as your financial situation changes, such as age, income, or changes in financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor will also provide personalized strategies based on your specific scenario.
