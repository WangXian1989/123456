(ðŸ”’Normal Output) Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k) first, especially if thereâ€™s a matching contribution. This offers immediate benefits in terms of tax deferral and free money. Then, consider funding an IRA, which can provide additional tax advantages, particularly if you choose a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Lastly, allocate funds to a taxable account for liquidity and flexibility. Diversifying across these accounts can help balance growth and access to funds when needed.

First off, throw as much as you can into your 401(k), especially if your employer matches â€“ thatâ€™s basically free money! Next up, hit that IRA. If you can swing a Roth, do it for those sweet tax-free withdrawals when you retire. Finally, stash some cash in a taxable account for easy access and flexibility. Itâ€™s all about striking that balance between locking cash away for the future and keeping some on hand for today. Just make sure you keep an eye on your tax implications when youâ€™re pulling money from these accounts â€“ nobody likes a surprise tax bill!
