The best way to allocate your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and current age. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough to get the full employer match** in your 401(k) if available. This is essentially free money and should be prioritized.

### 2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA & 401(k))**
   - **Consider maxing out your IRA** (either Traditional or Roth, depending on your income and tax situation) after you’ve captured your employer match. Contribution limits vary, so check the latest guidelines.
   - If you’re over 50, use catch-up contributions to save more.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Allocate money to taxable accounts for funds you may need access to before retirement. These can offer flexibility and liquidity.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes; holding investments for over a year before selling can minimize taxes on profits.

### 4. **Investment Strategy**
   - Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return. Consider factors like your age, risk tolerance, and time horizon.
   - Generally, keep more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where they can grow tax-free or tax-deferred.

### 5. **Rebalance and Review**
   - Regularly review your allocations and rebalance as necessary to ensure they align with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 10-15% of salary (up to the match)
- **IRA**: Max contribution ($6,500 or $7,500 if over 50)
- **Taxable Accounts**: Remainder of savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts

### Additional Considerations:
- Consider your current income and tax bracket, as contributions to Traditional accounts may lower your taxable income.
- Think about your retirement income needs, as withdrawals from different accounts will be taxed differently.

### Conclusion
Finding the right allocation involves a balance of maximizing tax benefits, ensuring future accessibility, and aligning with your long-term financial plan. Consulting with a financial advisor could also provide tailored strategies based on your unique situation.
