(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your investment goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Generally, you might consider:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize employer contributions first, as this is essentially free money. If your employer matches contributions, contribute enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you prefer tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA may be more suitable.

3. **Taxable accounts**: Use these for any additional investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Consider tax-efficient investments to minimize capital gains taxes.

Balancing contributions based on your goals and tax implications is essential, so consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice can be beneficial.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's tackle this money game! Hereâ€™s a smart way to juggle your cash between a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k)**: First, grab that employer match like itâ€™s the last slice of pizza! You want to max that out before tossing money anywhere else. Seriously, thatâ€™s free money, donâ€™t leave it on the table!

2. **IRA**: Next, consider the Roth IRA if you want tax-free growthâ€”it's like a VIP club for your money when you hit retirement age. If you need those tax deductions now, go for a Traditional IRA insteadâ€”everyone loves a good tax break!

3. **Taxable accounts**: Finally, anything left over? Funnel it into taxable accounts but choose investments wisely. Go for ETFs or index fundsâ€”they're generally easier on taxes. 

Remember, it's all about juggling the pros and cons of taxes and access. And hey, if you feel overwhelmed, hit up a financial advisor; itâ€™s their job to help you rock this!
