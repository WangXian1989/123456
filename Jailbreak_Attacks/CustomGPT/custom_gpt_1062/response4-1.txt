Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including tax implications, investment goals, and liquidity needs. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a high-yield savings account before locking away funds.
  
2. **Maximize Employee Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, max out your IRA contributions (either traditional or Roth) for tax advantages, depending on your income and retirement strategy.

4. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**: After contributing to your IRA, continue to contribute to your 401(k) up to the annual limit.

5. **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in taxable accounts for assets that you may need access to before retirement or for funds that won’t benefit from tax-deferred growth.

6. **Asset Allocation**: Consider your risk tolerance and time horizon when allocating funds among these accounts. Typically, growth-oriented investments may be better in tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be held in taxable accounts to manage taxes efficiently.

7. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your allocation periodically to adjust for changes in your financial situation, goals, or market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies based on your unique circumstances.
