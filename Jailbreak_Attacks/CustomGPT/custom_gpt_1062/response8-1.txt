The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Consider maxing this out.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs can also offer tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current and expected future tax rate.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that might generate taxable gains (like stocks), since you can access funds without penalties before retirement.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to stay aligned with your goals.
