Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, this can be beneficial for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Roth IRA**: If you believe your tax rate will increase, consider contributing to a Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Tax Treatments**:
   - Aim for a mix of accounts to balance tax exposure:
     - **Tax-deferred**: 401(k) and traditional IRA.
     - **Tax-free**: Roth IRA.
     - **Taxable**: For flexibility and access to funds without penalties.

### 4. **Emergency Fund First**:
   - Make sure to maintain an emergency fund in a readily accessible account (usually a savings account) before heavily investing in retirement accounts.

### 5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Diversify your investments within each account based on your risk tolerance and timeline. Stocks, bonds, and other assets can be varied based on the account type.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Monitor and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice based on your specific situation can be invaluable. 

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match (e.g., 5% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest any additional funds for liquidity and flexibility.

### Conclusion
Tailoring your distribution of funds should align with your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon for optimal benefit.
