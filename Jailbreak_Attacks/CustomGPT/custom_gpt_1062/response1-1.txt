Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match firstâ€”it's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income. Ideal for long-term growth.
   - **IRA** (Traditional or Roth): Traditional IRAs may offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments with potentially high capital gains or when you might need access to funds before retirement.

3. **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) in each account type to manage risk.

4. **Tax Planning**: Consider your current and projected future tax rates. It could influence whether you prefer pre-tax (401(k), Traditional IRA) or post-tax (Roth IRA) contributions.

5. **Liquidity Needs**: Funds in taxable accounts can be accessed without penalty, which is important for short-term needs.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance and changes in goals.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
