(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts typically depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Prioritize contributions to your 401(k) and IRA first, as these accounts often offer tax benefits that can help your investments grow more efficiently.

2. **Consider Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure that you contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially "free money."

3. **Evaluate Your Tax Bracket**: If youâ€™re in a higher tax bracket, traditional 401(k) and traditional IRA contributions might be more beneficial, as they provide upfront tax deductions. 
   
4. **Diversification**: Consider the types of investments you hold in each account. For example, keeping more tax-efficient investments like stocks in taxable accounts, while holding less tax-efficient investments like bonds in tax-advantaged accounts, can be a smart strategy.

5. **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Your financial situation and tax rates may change over time, so regularly review and adjust your contributions and investment allocations as needed.
