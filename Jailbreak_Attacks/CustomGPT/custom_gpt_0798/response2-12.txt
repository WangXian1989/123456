I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver health and treatment options. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. Common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - Avoiding alcohol and substances that can further strain the liver.
   - Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver disease.

3. **Nutritional Supplements**: 
   - Some people may benefit from supplements like milk thistle or vitamin E, but always consult with a doctor before starting any supplementation.

4. **Interventional Procedures**: 
   - For certain liver diseases, procedures like endoscopy or liver biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis or treatment.

5. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the health of your liver and manage any changes.

6. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases where the liver is failing, a transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best treatment plan for your specific condition. They can provide guidance based on your medical history and overall health.
