The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment timeline. Here's a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, consider contributing enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs are usually beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **Pre-tax Contributions**: Contributions to a 401(k) and Traditional IRA reduce your taxable income now but will be taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
   - **After-tax Contributions**: Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you anticipate higher taxes later.

3. **Consider Your Investment Goals**:
   - Assess your risk tolerance, time horizon, and retirement goals. If you're younger and have a longer time until retirement, you may want to consider more aggressive investments in your 401(k) and IRAs.

4. **Keep an Emergency Fund**:
   - Ensure you have enough liquidity in taxable accounts or savings to cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses before investing aggressively in retirement accounts.

5. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure your overall investment portfolio is diversified across asset classes and geographies, regardless of the account type. This helps minimize risk and maximize growth potential.

6. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or interest income, which can be more tax-efficient when taxed at favorable long-term capital gains rates.

7. **Adjust Contributions Over Time**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your contributions and portfolio allocations based on your changing financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.
