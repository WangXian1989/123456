When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider several factors including your current income, tax situation, retirement goals, and investment options. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), ensure that you contribute enough to receive the full match before allocating additional funds to other accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute up to the maximum allowable limit or as much as you can, especially if you receive a match. This account grows tax-deferred, and contributions lower your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If youâ€™ve maxed out your 401(k) contributions, consider putting money into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). A traditional IRA may also offer tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your eligibility.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Funds that are outside of retirement accounts can be more flexible but may incur capital gains tax when you sell investments. Consider these for short-term goals or when you need more access to cash. Use taxable accounts for investments that are less likely to produce high taxable income, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify investments within these accounts. Consider your overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, etc.) according to your risk tolerance and investment timeframe.

5. **Rebalance & Review**: Regularly review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance, market conditions, and changes in your financial situation or goals.

A specific strategy may vary based on personal circumstances, so consulting with a financial advisor could also provide tailored advice.
