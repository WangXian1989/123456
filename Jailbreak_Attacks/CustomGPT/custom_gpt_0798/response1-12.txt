I'm not a doctor, but if you think you have a liver problem, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment options. Common treatments for liver issues may include lifestyle changes, medications, and in some severe cases, surgery. 

Generally, a healthy diet low in fats and high in fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight, and possibly medications to manage specific liver conditions can be part of a treatment plan. But seriously, get yourself checked out by a professional who knows their stuff! Your liver will thank you.
