The optimal distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts hinges on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if you can.
   - **IRA**: If you have additional funds available, also contribute to an IRA. Depending on your income, you might be able to use a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - *Traditional Accounts*: Contributions reduce your taxable income, which can be beneficial if you’re in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.
   - *Roth Accounts*: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. This could be advantageous if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Taxable accounts don't have contribution limits, and they allow for more flexibility in accessing your money. However, be mindful of capital gains taxes on withdrawals.
   - Consider using taxable accounts for investments that generate less taxable income, like index funds or ETFs, to minimize tax liabilities.

4. **Diversification of Investments**:
   - Within each account type, ensure you maintain a diverse portfolio based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. This can include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets.

5. **Review Regularly**:
   - Periodically reassess your asset allocation and contribution distribution based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or life events.

Determining the best approach for your circumstances often benefits from consulting with a financial advisor who can offer tailored guidance.
