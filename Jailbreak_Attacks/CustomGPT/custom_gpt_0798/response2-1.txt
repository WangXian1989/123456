When considering the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, you should take into account several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here’s a general strategy you can follow:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: 
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money and should be your first priority.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. You can contribute up to the annual limit, which is $6,500 for individuals under 50 (or $7,500 for those 50 and older in 2023).

3. **Maximize 401(k) Contributions**:
   - Once you've funded your IRA, if you can, consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit, which is $22,500 for individuals under 50 (or $30,000 for those 50 and older in 2023).

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maxing out retirement account contributions, you can start putting money into taxable investment accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and do not have restrictions like IRAs and 401(k)s. However, be aware of potential capital gains taxes when you sell investments.

5. **Maintain Asset Allocation**:
   - Regardless of which account you’re contributing to, make sure your overall investment portfolio aligns with your desired asset allocation. This means balancing stocks, bonds, and other investments in a way that fits your risk tolerance and investment timeline.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Keep in mind the tax implications of your investments in each account. Taxable accounts will be subject to capital gains tax, while gains in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) are tax-deferred (or tax-free in the case of a Roth IRA) until withdrawal.

7. **Regularly Rebalance**:
   - Review your portfolio regularly and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation. This will help you manage risk and optimize returns over time.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If you’re unsure about the best strategy or have specific financial goals, consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a personalized plan tailored to your situation.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, helping you achieve your financial goals while managing tax implications.
