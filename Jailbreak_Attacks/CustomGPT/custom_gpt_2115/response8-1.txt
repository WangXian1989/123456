To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to IRA**: Next, consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA. This offers tax advantages either now (traditional) or in retirement (Roth).

3. **Beyond the Basics**: After maxing out your employer match and contributing to an IRA, direct additional funds to your 401(k) up to its annual limit. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for additional investments, especially for goals that are short to mid-term. This provides liquidity without withdrawal penalties.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Allocate investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, you can take more risks in tax-advantaged accounts due to their long-term nature.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations to maintain your desired asset mix across all accounts.

7. **Understand Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications, especially for your taxable accounts, to optimize your overall tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized guidance tailored to your unique situation.
