Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Investment Choices**: Choose low-cost, diversified funds that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Considerations**: A traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Max out contributions if you can, especially in a Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use this for funds you may need in the short term. Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs.
   - **Tax Strategies**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes and consider tax-loss harvesting.

### General Tips:
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds) across all accounts.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations based on market performance and life changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

Always consider your individual circumstances and long-term goals when deciding on asset distribution.
