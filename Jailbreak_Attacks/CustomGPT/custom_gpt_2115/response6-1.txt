Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you qualify (income limits apply). The tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement can be beneficial.

### 2. **Balance Contributions as Follows**
   - **Short-Term Goals**: Allocate savings for short-term goals in taxable accounts. This allows easier access without penalties.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Prioritize 401(k) and IRA contributions for long-term investment with tax advantages.

### 3. **Consider Asset Allocation**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, younger investors might favor stocks for growth, while those closer to retirement shift toward bonds and safer assets.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts and keep tax-efficient ones (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### Summary
- **Immediate Focus**: Max out 401(k) match → Contribute to IRA → Fund taxable accounts.
- **Investment Strategy**: Consider time horizons, types of investments, and your overall financial goals. 

Adjust based on yearly income changes, and revisit your strategy periodically.
