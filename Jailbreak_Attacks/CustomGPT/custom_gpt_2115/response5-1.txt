Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here's a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a matching contribution, start by contributing enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

2. **Utilize IRAs**: Consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs may provide tax deductions now.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. These provide more liquidity and can be used for short-term goals without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts, keeping tax efficiency in mind. For instance, place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating assets (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and interest.

5. **Regular Reviews**: Revisit your distribution strategy annually or when significant life changes occur.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
