To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If high employer match, contribute here first. Consider the investment options and fees.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA next for tax advantages. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while Traditional IRAs provide upfront tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for additional investments after maxing out retirement accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment strategy across all accounts to balance risk and growth potential.

5. **Regular Review**: Periodically reassess your contributions and investment allocation based on financial goals, market conditions, and life changes.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized strategies based on your financial situation, consider working with a professional.

This approach can help you optimize your investments while considering tax implications and growth potential.
