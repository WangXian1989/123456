The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s free money.
   - **Tax Deferral**: Maximize contributions to enjoy tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Types of IRA**: Consider either a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement).
   - **Contribution Limits**: Aim to maximize the annual contribution limit if possible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use these for short-term goals or as a contingency fund.
   - **Capital Gains Management**: Invest in tax-efficient funds or consider tax-loss harvesting to minimize taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Risk Assessment**: Each account type may have different investment risk profiles. Adjust your asset allocation accordingly.
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside of these accounts.
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
1. **Max Out 401(k)** up to the employer match.
2. **Contribute to IRA** to the maximum limit.
3. **Allocate Remaining Funds** to taxable accounts, focusing on tax-efficient investments.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy to your unique circumstances.
