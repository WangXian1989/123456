I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems, depending on the specific condition:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can greatly improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: Specific medications may be prescribed for conditions like hepatitis or fatty liver disease.

3. **Monitoring and Management**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests and manage symptoms.

4. **Advanced Treatments**: In severe cases, treatments like liver transplant might be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
