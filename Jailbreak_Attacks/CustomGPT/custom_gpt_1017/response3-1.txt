The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially “free money.”

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Utilize this for higher contributions and tax-deferred growth. Consider your investment options and fees.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, max out contributions to an IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to increase.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for flexibility. These can be used for short-term goals or to withdraw without penalties before retirement age.

4. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: 
   - If you’re in a higher tax bracket, prioritize tax-deferred accounts. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth option may make more sense.

5. **Diversify Investments**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Review your investment strategy annually or as your financial situation changes. Adjust contributions based on market performance and personal goals.

Consult a financial advisor for a tailored strategy based on your specific situation.
