5. **Simplify Voting**: Provide clear information about how to register and vote, including deadlines and voting methods. Use reminders and countdowns on social media.

6. **Gamification**: Create apps or online platforms that gamify the voting process, encouraging friendly competition among peers.

7. **Targeted Advertising**: Leverage data-driven ads on social media, focusing on interests and behaviors that align with young votersâ€™ concerns.
