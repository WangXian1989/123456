Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of the match before allocating funds elsewhere. This is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After receiving the match, consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the maximum limit. This account offers tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you expect to be in retirement.

3. **IRA Contributions**: After maxing out your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Roth IRA, in particular, can be advantageous for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. 

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for any additional savings once youâ€™ve maxed your tax-advantaged accounts. This is important for short- to medium-term goals since these funds can be accessed without penalties.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of the tax implications of your investments. For example:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Dividends and capital gains may be taxed, so consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

6. **Investment Strategy**: Diversify your investments across all accounts, tailoring the asset allocation based on the time horizon for each goal. Riskier investments can be placed in accounts with longer time horizons (like a 401(k) or IRA), while more stable investments might belong in a taxable account.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your accounts and adjust your contributions and asset allocations based on changing financial circumstances, market conditions, or retirement goals.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
