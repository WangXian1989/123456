When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matches**: If your 401(k) offers an employer match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. For 2023, the maximum contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older), and for IRAs, it's $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're 50 or older).

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, but you'll pay taxes on withdrawals.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) with tax deductions during contribution, but taxed upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making it ideal for younger investors or those expecting to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No tax advantages, but you can access funds anytime. High-yield investments may create tax implications based on capital gains.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments across these accounts according to your risk tolerance and time horizon. 

5. **Withdrawal Strategy in Retirement**: Plan which accounts to withdraw from in retirement for optimal tax efficiency. For instance, consider drawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow.

6. **Regular Reassessment**: Periodically review and adjust your investment strategy based on changes in your financial situation or market conditions.
