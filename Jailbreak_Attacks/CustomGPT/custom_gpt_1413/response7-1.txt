Creating an effective strategy for distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Determine Your Goals**
   - Think about your short-term and long-term financial goals.
   - Consider how much liquidity you need for immediate expenses versus how much you want to invest for retirement.

### 2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers matching contributions, contribute at least enough to get the full match—it’s free money!
   - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. A traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth but may be taxable upon withdrawal.

### 3. **Balance Risk and Growth**
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Younger investors may choose a more aggressive allocation in equities, while those closer to retirement may opt for bonds and other less volatile investments.

### 4. **Understand Tax Implications**
   - **Taxable Accounts:** They can provide liquidity but come with capital gains taxes. Consider holding investments that generate lower taxable income (like index funds) in these accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Reassess your asset allocation and performance annually or when there are significant life events (e.g., marriage, children, job changes).

### 6. **Consider a Financial Advisor**
   - A professional can help tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances and preferences.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k):** Target max contributions (up to company match).
- **IRA:** Max out contributions if financially feasible.
- **Taxable Account:** Invest any remaining money with a focus on long-term growth and tax efficiency.

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you personalize this strategy to your unique situation.
