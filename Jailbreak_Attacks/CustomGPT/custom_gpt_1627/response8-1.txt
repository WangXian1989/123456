Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Contribute the maximum allowable amount to your 401(k) and IRA accounts first. These accounts offer tax benefits that can significantly enhance your long-term growth.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers matching contributions, make sure to contribute enough to receive the full match, as this is essentially free money.

3. **IRA Considerations**: If you're eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA, which allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA may be more beneficial than a traditional IRA.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate money to taxable accounts. These accounts can offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment choices.

5. **Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments among different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, higher risk investments may be suitable for tax-advantaged accounts, while more stable investments can be held in taxable accounts.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes in your taxable accounts. Holding investments for over a year can reduce your capital gains tax rates.

7. **Rebalance Annually**: Review and adjust your asset allocation periodically to align with your financial goals and market conditions.

Always consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
