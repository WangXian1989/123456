When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, lowering your taxable income now. Withdrawals during retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions are often tax-deductible, but withdrawals are also taxed as regular income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals, including earnings, are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed on dividends, interest, and any capital gains when sold.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), contribute enough to get the full match as this is essentially free money.

3. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Focus on maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first. In 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for 401(k) accounts and $6,500 for IRAs ($7,500 for those over 50).

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, ensure you have a mix of asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Consider Your Withdrawal Strategy**: Upon retirement, you might want to strategically withdraw from these accounts to minimize taxes. For example, withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s to grow.

6. **Emergency Fund and Debt**: Ensure you have an emergency fund and manage any high-interest debts before aggressively investing.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as needed based on performance and changing financial goals.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Personal circumstances vary widely; consider seeking professional advice tailored to your specific situation.

By thoroughly evaluating these factors, you can create a balanced approach to distributing your funds across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, depending on your financial situation and goals.
