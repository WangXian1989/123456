The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: 
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if it's a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - Tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s and Traditional IRAs) are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - For accounts that you will tap into in the short term, like taxable accounts, consider investing in tax-efficient funds or strategies to minimize capital gains taxes.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all account types to mitigate risk. This includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Have a clear plan for how and when you will withdraw from each account type during retirement to minimize tax liability. Typically, you might want to draw down taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, and finally tax-free accounts.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations in each account to stay aligned with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your individual situation.
