Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your individual financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a general guideline:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Maximize contributions to your employer-sponsored 401(k), especially if there’s a match. The contributions reduce your taxable income and can help you save significantly for retirement.

2. **IRA Accounts**: After maxing out the 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Traditional IRA provides tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current tax rate and expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investments, especially if you’ve already maxed out contributions to the aforementioned accounts. This is beneficial for financial goals outside of retirement (e.g., buying a home, education) and offers more flexibility regarding withdrawals. Keep in mind capital gains taxes when selling investments.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**: Regardless of account type, ensure your portfolio is diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and aligned with your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Review Regularly**: Reassess your investment strategy periodically to ensure it still aligns with your goals, especially as your situation or market conditions change.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific financial situation.
