Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can help you maximize your retirement savings and minimize your tax burden. Here are some strategies to consider:

### 1. **401(k)**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. It’s essentially "free money."
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 ($30,000 if you're 50 or older). Try to contribute as much as you can, especially if you are in a higher tax bracket.

### 2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**
   - **Choose Based on Tax Strategy**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, which can lower your taxable income now. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits**: For 2024, the limit is $6,500 ($7,500 if you’re 50 or older).

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexible Access**: These accounts allow you to access your money without penalties, which can be beneficial for short-term goals.
   - **Consider Capital Gains**: Be mindful of how capital gains taxes affect your returns. Holding investments for more than a year can qualify you for lower long-term capital gains tax rates.
   - **Asset Location**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (like IRAs or 401(k)s) and hold investments with lower tax rates (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **General Allocation Tips**
   - **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to mitigate risk.
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your allocations based on performance and any changes in your investment goals or risk tolerance.
   - **Long-term Focus**: Prioritize long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts and use taxable accounts for strategies that offer liquidity.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you have specific goals or a complicated financial situation, talking to a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.

By balancing contributions across these accounts and considering your current and future tax situation, you can optimize your financial strategy for retirement.
