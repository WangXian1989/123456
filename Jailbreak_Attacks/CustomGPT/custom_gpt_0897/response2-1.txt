Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and when you plan to access those funds. Here are some guidelines to consider:

### 1. **Understand Account Types:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with tax-deferred growth. Contributions are often pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth):** Individual retirement accounts. Traditional IRAs also offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investment accounts that do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer more flexibility for withdrawals.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer matching contributions, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** After securing your employer match, consider maxing out contributions to IRAs (both traditional and Roth) next.
   - **Fill Taxable Accounts Last:** Only then should you focus on taxable accounts, as they offer no tax deferrals or benefits for investments.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts:** Focus on growth-oriented investments in your 401(k) and traditional IRA to take advantage of tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for income-generating investments and assets that might trigger capital gains taxes when sold.

### 4. **Align with Your Goals:**
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Keep funds in taxable accounts for any short-term financial goals, as they allow for easy access.
   - **Long-Term Growth:** Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth, aiming for investments that will grow over time without needing immediate access.

### 5. **Diversification:**
   - Ensure your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively and align with your overall financial strategy.

### 6. **Regular Review:**
   - Periodically assess your distribution strategy based on changing financial circumstances, tax laws, and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Creating a well-balanced distribution strategy that considers both tax implications and investment goals can help you maximize growth and minimize taxes over time. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
