Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Continue contributing to this account, especially if you're in a high tax bracket. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: 
   - Use taxable accounts for investment needs that are shorter-term or if you need more liquidity. It allows flexibility to access funds without penalties.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your portfolio distribution regularly (e.g., yearly) to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

6. **Consider Your Tax Situation**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes when selling investments in taxable accounts. Tax-loss harvesting can be beneficial.

7. **Long-Term Strategy**: Focus on long-term growth, particularly in tax-advantaged accounts, as they are typically intended for retirement.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
