To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match; it’s essentially free money.
     - Focus on pre-tax contributions to lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**:
     - Prioritize a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement—enjoy tax-free growth.
     - Consider a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions depending on your income level.

### 2. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains rather than ordinary income (e.g., index funds).
   - Maintain a diverse mix of investments that can offer liquidity for short-term needs without penalty.

### **General Allocation Strategy**
- **Emergency Funds**: Ensure you have liquid savings for emergencies before investing heavily in long-term accounts.
- **Age-Based Allocation**: Adjust investments based on your age and risk tolerance:
  - Younger investors can afford to take more risks within their retirement accounts.
  - As you near retirement, gradually shift to more stable, income-generating investments.

Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on market conditions and personal financial goals.
