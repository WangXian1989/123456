Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match as it's essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA for potential tax advantages. A Roth IRA can be beneficial for tax-free growth.

3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Once you've maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts for flexibility and to access funds without penalties.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Typically, more aggressive investments can go into tax-deferred accounts, while more stable investments like bonds might be better suited for taxable accounts to minimize tax impact on capital gains.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider placing tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax liability.

Regularly review your portfolio to ensure alignment with your financial goals and adjust as needed, especially as your circumstances change. Consulting with a financial advisor can further tailor a strategy to your specific situation.
