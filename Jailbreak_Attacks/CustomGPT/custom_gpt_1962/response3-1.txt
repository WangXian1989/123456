Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends largely on your financial goals, tax situation, age, and risk tolerance. Here are some general steps to consider:

1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Tax-advantaged account often offered by employers, with potential matching contributions.
   - **IRA**: Individual Retirement Account, also tax-advantaged but with different contribution limits and withdrawal rules.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investable accounts where earnings are subject to capital gains and income taxes.

2. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

3. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - After the employer match, consider maximizing contributions to your IRA (Traditional or Roth, depending on your tax situation).
   - If you have access to both a 401(k) and an IRA, focus on the account with the best tax advantages.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-deferred accounts (401(k), Traditional IRA)**: You'll pay taxes upon withdrawal, which may be lower if you're in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth accounts**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Taxable accounts**: They provide more liquidity and flexibility, but youâ€™ll owe capital gains tax on profits.

5. **Diversify Investments Within Accounts**:
   - Ensure you have a balanced investment strategy within each account type to mitigate risk and align with your timeline (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.).

6. **Regularly Review and Adjust**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation, market conditions, and retirement goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If uncertain, consider working with a financial planner to tailor an investment strategy to your specific situation.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
