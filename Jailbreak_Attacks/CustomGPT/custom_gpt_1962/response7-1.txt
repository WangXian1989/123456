Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to get the full match if available; this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribution Limits:** For 2024, you can contribute up to $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older).
   - **Pre-Tax or Roth:** Decide whether to contribute pre-tax for tax-deferred growth or Roth for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Traditional IRA:** Ideal for tax-deferred growth. Contributions may be tax-deductible depending on your income level.
   - **Roth IRA:** Best for tax-free growth and withdrawals. Income limits apply; for 2024, contributions phase out for higher incomes.
   - **Annual Contribution Limits:** $6,500 ($7,500 if you're 50 or older) for 2024.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Flexibility:** These accounts offer easier access to funds without penalties. Suitable for short-term goals.
   - **Tax Implications:** Be mindful of capital gains taxes on any profits made when you sell investments.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments:** Consider municipal bonds or long-term stock investments for potentially lower tax burdens.

### **General Strategy**
1. **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved in a high-yield savings account.
2. **Max Out 401(k) Match:** Maximize contributions for employer match.
3. **Fund IRAs Next:** Invest in a Traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation.
4. **Coordinate Taxable Accounts:** After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, invest additional savings in taxable accounts.

### **Final Considerations**
- **Asset Allocation:** Diversify investments based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Reassess Regularly:** Review your portfolio and contributions annually or after major life changes.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor:** A professional can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.

### Summary
Start with tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) and IRA, and then use taxable accounts for additional savings. Adjust contributions based on your goals, tax situation, and when you plan to utilize the funds.
