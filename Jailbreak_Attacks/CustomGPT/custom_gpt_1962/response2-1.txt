Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering various factors such as your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute aggressively if your employer offers matching contributions. This account typically offers pre-tax contributions, lowering your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a Traditional IRA can provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, direct additional savings into taxable accounts. These accounts offer flexibility and can be useful for short- to mid-term goals.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk and volatility.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to align with your risk tolerance and goals.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains taxes on taxable accounts, especially for frequent trading.

### Example Distribution:

- **401(k)**: 15-20% of your income up to employer match.
- **IRA**: Max out your contributions (currently $6,500 for individuals under 50).
- **Taxable Account**: Contribute any additional savings after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### Personal Considerations:

- Age and retirement timeline.
- Current income and expected retirement income.
- Financial goals (e.g., buying a house, travel, etc.).
- Risk tolerance.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your situation.
