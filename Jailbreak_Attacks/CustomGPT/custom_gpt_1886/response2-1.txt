Distributing your money effectively among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a general strategy to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution, prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**:
   - Consider funding a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. A Roth IRA offers tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect your tax rate to rise. A Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits if you are eligible for deductions.

3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your IRA, continue to increase your contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limits. This also provides tax-deferred growth.

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Invest in taxable accounts after maximizing your tax-advantaged accounts. These accounts offer more flexibility with withdrawals and investment choices but are subject to capital gains tax.

5. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Tailor your investment strategy based on account type. For tax-advantaged accounts (like 401(k) and IRA), consider holding assets with higher growth potential (like stocks). In taxable accounts, it might be advantageous to hold more tax-efficient investments (like index funds or ETFs) that minimize tax liabilities.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan for how and when you'll withdraw from these accounts in retirement to minimize your tax burden. Generally, withdrawing from taxable accounts first can take advantage of lower tax rates and let tax-advantaged accounts grow longer.

7. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Periodically review your allocations and contributions based on financial goals, changing circumstances, and market conditions.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your specific situation and goals.
