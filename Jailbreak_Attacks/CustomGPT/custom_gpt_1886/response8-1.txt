Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts requires considering several factors, including your current financial situation, retirement goals, tax implications, and the investment options available in each account. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: After taking advantage of the 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while Traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

3. **Fund the 401(k) Up to the Contribution Limit**: If youâ€™re still under the limit for your 401(k) contributions, consider maximizing this account next. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income in the year of contribution.

4. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to your retirement accounts, you can use taxable accounts for additional investments. These accounts provide flexibility for withdrawals and can be useful for short-term goals.

5. **Asset Location Strategy**: Consider where to hold different types of investments:
   - **Tax-inefficient investments** (like bonds or REITs) are better suited for tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA).
   - **Tax-efficient investments** (like index funds or stocks that you plan to hold long-term) can be placed in taxable accounts.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure a proper mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across your accounts, aligned with your risk tolerance and time horizon.

7. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation within and across your accounts to stay aligned with your investment strategy.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific financial situation, goals, and tax considerations.

This approach helps optimize tax efficiency while aligning your investments with your financial goals.
