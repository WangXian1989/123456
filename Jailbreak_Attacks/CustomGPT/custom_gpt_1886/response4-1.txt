To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following steps:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Focus on Tax Advantage**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before taxable accounts. For instance:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions may reduce your taxable income, and the growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type (Traditional or Roth), you can benefit either from tax-deductible contributions or tax-free growth.

3. **Assess Investment Options**: Look at the investment options available in your 401(k) and IRA. Sometimes, IRAs have more diverse investments, while 401(k)s may offer lower fees.

4. **Diversify Investments**: Within these accounts, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and timeline. A mix of stocks, bonds, and possibly alternative investments can help mitigate risk.

5. **Utilize Taxable Accounts Wisely**: Use taxable accounts for investments that benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates (like stocks held for more than a year) or to invest in assets that don't fit well in tax-advantaged accounts (like certain types of real estate).

6. **Regularly Reassess**: Periodically review your allocations and performance, adjusting contributions based on your financial goals, market conditions, and any changes in tax laws.

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
