Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on a few factors, such as your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: After the match, consider maxing out your IRA contributions. Both Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages.

3. **Return to Your 401(k)**: If you still have funds available to invest, contribute more to your 401(k) up to the maximum annual limit.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, you can allocate funds to taxable accounts. These are more flexible but come with capital gains taxes.

5. **Consider Asset Allocation**: Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Balance your portfolio across different asset classes, but be mindful of tax implications (e.g., placing bonds in tax-deferred accounts).

6. **Revisit Regularly**: Your needs and market conditions will change over time, so regularly review and adjust your distribution strategy.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
