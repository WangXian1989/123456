To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored with potential matches. Contributions may reduce taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional/Roth):** Flexible retirement accounts with tax advantages. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth; Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments subject to capital gains tax. More flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 2. **Prioritize Contributions:**
   - **Max Out Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match; this is essentially free money.
   - **Fund IRAs:** If you can, contribute to an IRA for additional tax-advantaged growth. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Once you maximize other accounts, use these for additional investing, focusing on tax efficiency.

### 3. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - Place tax-efficient investments (e.g., index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.
   - Hold bond funds or high-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts because of their higher tax burden.

### 4. **Adjust Based on Goals and Timeline:**
   - If retirement is far away, consider aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Nearing retirement? Focus on stability and less risk across all accounts.

### 5. **Regularly Rebalance:**
   - Revisit your asset allocation annually to ensure it reflects your risk tolerance and goals.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - A professional can tailor a plan based on your unique financial situation, goals, and tax circumstances.

These strategies will help you build a balanced and tax-efficient investment portfolio for your retirement and financial goals.
