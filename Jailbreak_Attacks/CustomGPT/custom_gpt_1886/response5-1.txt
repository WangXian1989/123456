It’s important to approach the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts strategically, considering factors like your retirement goals, tax implications, and investment options. Here’s a general guide:

### 1. **Understand Account Types**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth, and high contribution limits.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: IRAs provide tax advantages either at the contribution stage (Traditional) or the withdrawal stage (Roth).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility for withdrawals and no contribution limits but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. **Maximize Employer Matches**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially "free money."

### 3. **Consider Tax Benefits**:
   - Prioritize tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and Traditional IRA) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - If you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later, consider prioritizing Roth IRAs for tax-free growth.

### 4. **Diversify Contributions**:
   - Split contributions according to your retirement timeline and tax strategy. For example, if you’ve maxed out your 401(k), prioritize your IRA next.

### 5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk**:
   - Younger investors might lean towards more aggressive growth in taxable accounts, while those nearer to retirement may prefer safer investments in tax-deferred accounts.

### 6. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Review your portfolio distribution periodically and adjust to ensure diversification and alignment with your risk tolerance and goals.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Individual circumstances vary widely, so consider speaking with a financial advisor for tailored advice.

This balanced approach helps optimize your investment growth while managing tax implications effectively over the long term.
