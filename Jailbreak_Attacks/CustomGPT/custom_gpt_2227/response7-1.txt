When considering the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it’s essential to account for factors such as your tax situation, investment goals, and timeline. Here's a general approach to help guide your decisions:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, the limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). Aim to contribute as much as you can while still allowing for other investment opportunities.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Traditional vs. Roth IRA**: Consider a Traditional IRA if you want tax deductions now and plan to withdraw in retirement when you may be in a lower tax bracket. Opt for a Roth IRA if you prefer tax-free withdrawals in retirement and expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Contribution Limits**: For 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re over 50). If eligible, maximize contributions to your IRA next after securing your 401(k) match.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement or for investments not suitable for retirement accounts (like real estate or certain bonds).
   - Taxable accounts provide flexibility, meaning you can access your money when necessary. 

### General Distribution Strategy:
1. **Start with Employer 401(k)**: Ensure maximum contributions, especially if matched.
2. **Move to IRAs**: Focus on IRA contributions based on tax implications and retirement strategy.
3. **Invest in Taxable Accounts**: Allocate the remainder of your investment funds here for flexibility.

**Considerations**:
- Always assess your overall financial strategy, risk tolerance, and time horizon for each type of account.
- Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your financial situation and goals.
