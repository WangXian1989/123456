Determining the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are typically pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income in the short term. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, this may be advantageous.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These do not have the same tax advantages but can provide flexibility in accessing funds without penalties prior to retirement.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing heavily, ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of expenses) in a readily accessible savings account.

4. **Investment Goals and Timeline**: Consider how long you plan to invest the money:
   - Long-term goals (retirement) might prioritize tax-advantaged accounts.
   - Short-term goals may be better suited for taxable accounts, which can provide liquidity without penalties.

5. **Diversification**: Ensure you’re diversifying your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and geographies within each account.

6. **Annual Limits**: Be mindful of contribution limits for each account type:
   - 401(k): $19,500 for those under 50 (as of 2021) and $26,000 if you're 50 or older.
   - IRA: $6,000 for those under 50 and $7,000 for those 50 or older.
   - These limits may change annually, so verify with current IRS guidelines.

7. **Tax Considerations**: Manage your taxable accounts to balance capital gains taxes and income taxes. Consider the tax implications of your investments, such as investments that yield dividends or interest.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If unsure, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can offer personalized advice based on your unique financial situation.

Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers your current financial situation, future goals, and tax implications will help optimize your distribution among these accounts. If you have specific numbers or percentages in mind, it can also help to tailor this advice further.
