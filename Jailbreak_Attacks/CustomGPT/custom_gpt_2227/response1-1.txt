Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors including your age, income, tax situation, and retirement goals. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full match first. It's essentially free money.

2. **Consider Roth vs. Traditional**: If you can, diversify by having both a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA. Traditional IRAs give you tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Tax Efficiency**: In taxable accounts, aim to hold investments that are more tax-efficient (like index funds or ETFs). Save bonds and high-dividend stocks for your tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impacts.

4. **Overall Strategy**:
   - Focus on maxing out tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) first.
   - After maxing out your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Roth IRA if eligible.
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that you might need to access before retirement or for longer-term growth after maxing out tax-advantaged options.

5. **Rebalance**: Regularly review and rebalance your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Consider working with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.

**Important**: Always keep in mind your risk tolerance and investment strategy!
