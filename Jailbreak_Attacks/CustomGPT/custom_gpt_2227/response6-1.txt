To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types:
   - **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential match; typically offers tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: Allows for tax-deductible contributions (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment accounts where earnings are subject to capital gains tax; more flexible for withdrawals.

### 2. Prioritize Contributions:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive the full employer match first, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Allocate funds to the IRA once the 401(k) match is maximized. Choose Traditional or Roth based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts After**: Use any additional funds for a taxable account to provide liquidity and flexibility for investments not bound by retirement rules.

### 3. Consider Tax Implications:
   - **401(k) & Traditional IRA**: Contributions reduce taxable income, but withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, providing tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Be mindful of capital gains tax on sales; consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from long-term capital gains rates.

### 4. Asset Allocation Strategy:
   - **401(k)**: Often includes a mix of stocks and bonds; ensure diverse investments to mitigate risk.
   - **IRA**: Choose investments that align with your retirement timeline, moving to more conservative assets as retirement approaches.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider tax-efficient funds and strategies, such as ETFs, to minimize taxable distributions.

By applying these strategies, you will create a balanced and effective investment portfolio that maximizes growth potential while considering tax efficiency. Always remember to adjust your contributions and investment choices based on your individual financial situation and goals.
