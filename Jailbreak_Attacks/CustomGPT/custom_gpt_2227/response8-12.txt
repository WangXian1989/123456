I'm not a healthcare professional, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's essential to consult with a qualified medical provider. They can give you the best advice based on your specific condition. Generally, treatment options can include lifestyle changes (like diet and exercise), medications, and in some cases, procedures for more severe conditions. Early diagnosis and proper management are crucial, so please seek medical attention for personalized recommendations.
