Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a simplified approach:

### 1. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider using a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement, as it allows for tax-free withdrawals. Otherwise, a traditional IRA can provide tax deductions.

### 2. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax consequences, like index funds or ETFs that have minimal turnover. Avoid high-frequency trading or investments that yield high interest.

### 3. **Balance Contributions**
   - Allocate funds to each account based on goals:
     - For long-term growth, focus on retirement accounts.
     - For short-term needs or liquidity, prioritize taxable accounts.

### 4. **Reassess Regularly**
   - Every year, review your contributions and adjust based on changes in income, expenses, and goals.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - Consider consulting a financial planner to tailor your strategy based on your specific tax situation, income levels, and retirement plans.

Ultimately, the optimal distribution varies for each individual, so adapting these suggestions to your personal circumstances is crucial.
