To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts** (like a 401(k) and traditional IRA): Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. Consider placing investments with high growth potential here, as long-term capital gains can be taxed at lower rates.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have an emergency savings fund outside of these accounts before investing heavily.

4. **Diversification Strategy**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for a mix of stocks and bonds to balance growth and risk.
   - Place more aggressive investments in tax-advantaged accounts, where growth is shielded from immediate tax impacts.

5. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and adjust your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawals from these accounts in retirement to minimize overall tax burden, considering required minimum distributions (RMDs) for traditional accounts.

7. **Individual Goals**: Tailor your approach based on your retirement goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor the strategy to your specific financial situation.
