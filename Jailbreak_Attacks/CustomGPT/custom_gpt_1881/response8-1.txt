Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match first. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA:** Consider traditional or Roth IRA options based on your current vs. expected future tax rate. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Consider Contribution Limits**
   - For 2024, the contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000 (with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution if you're over 50). The limit for IRAs is $6,500 (with a $1,000 catch-up).
   - Distribute your contributions to take full advantage of these limits if possible.

### 3. **Include Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, consider allocating funds to taxable accounts. These provide more liquidity and flexibility, allowing you to withdraw funds without penalties.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**
   - Spread your investments across various asset classes in all accounts. Ensure a balanced mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Evaluate Tax Implications**
   - Keep in mind that 401(k) and traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed as regular income in retirement, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free. Taxable accounts may incur capital gains taxes.

### 6. **Review Regularly**
   - Reassess your distribution strategy annually or when significant life events occur (e.g., job change, marriage, retirement).

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized guidance tailored to your unique financial situation and goals.
