Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, contribute enough to get the full match first. This is essentially "free" money.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement will be taxed.
   - **IRA (Roth vs. Traditional)**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made after-tax, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: You pay capital gains tax on profits when you sell investments. Consider holding investments long-term to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Emergency Fund First**: Ensure you have an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months of living expenses) before heavily investing.

4. **Debt Considerations**: Pay down high-interest debt before contributing significantly to retirement accounts.

5. **Investment Strategy**: Align accounts with your investment strategy:
   - **Aggressive Growth**: Consider placing higher-risk investments in a Roth IRA for potential tax-free growth.
   - **Income Generation**: Taxable accounts can hold income-generating assets; be mindful of the tax implications.

6. **Diversification**: Ensure that you diversify your investments across all accounts to mitigate risk.

7. **Consistency**: Regularly contribute to these accounts, taking advantage of dollar-cost averaging.

8. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically assess your allocations based on performance, changes in tax laws, and shifts in your financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
