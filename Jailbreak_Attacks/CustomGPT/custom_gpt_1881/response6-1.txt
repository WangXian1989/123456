Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline to help you decide:

### 1. Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First
   - **401(k) Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money. Aim to max out your contributions if possible, especially if you’re in a high tax bracket.
   - **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Each has different tax implications, so choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation.

### 2. Consider Tax Implications
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may not benefit from tax-advantaged growth, like short-term investments or specific assets that may generate high taxable income.
   - **Asset Location Strategy**: Place investments that generate ordinary income (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts, while keeping tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax liability.

### 3. Adjust Based on Age and Goals
   - **Younger Investors**: Focus more on growth in tax-advantaged accounts since you have more time for compounding.
   - **Nearer to Retirement**: Shift towards a more conservative allocation and ensure you have liquidity in taxable accounts for potential withdrawals.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: 40%
- **IRA**: 30%
- **Taxable Accounts**: 30%

Always consult a financial advisor to tailor this plan to your specific situation.
