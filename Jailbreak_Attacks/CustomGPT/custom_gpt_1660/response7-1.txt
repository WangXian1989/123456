When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are several factors to consider in order to optimize your financial strategy:

1. **401(k)**: Maximize contributions to your 401(k), especially if your employer offers a match. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match.

2. **IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. Depending on your income level, you may choose between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals in retirement). The choice depends on your current tax rate versus your expected tax rate in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Once you’ve maximized your contributions to your retirement accounts, you can start investing in taxable accounts. These accounts provide more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investments but may incur capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Diversification is key. Allocate your investments according to your risk tolerance and investment goals across all accounts. Generally, higher-risk assets can be placed in tax-advantaged accounts, while more conservative investments can be in taxable accounts for better tax efficiency.

5. **Tax Efficiency**: Consider the tax implications of your investments. Place tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-deferred accounts and tax-efficient assets (like stocks) in taxable accounts. This will help you minimize the taxes owed on dividends and capital gains.

6. **Rebalancing**: Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

Ultimately, it’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to create a tailored strategy based on your specific financial situation and goals.
