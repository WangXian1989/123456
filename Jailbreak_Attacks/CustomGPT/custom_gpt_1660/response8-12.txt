I'm not a doctor, but it's important to talk to a healthcare provider for personalized advice regarding liver issues. Common treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol. Depending on the specific liver condition, medications or even treatments like antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis, or procedures for liver cirrhosis, might be considered. It's essential to have a thorough evaluation by a medical professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.
