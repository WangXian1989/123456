I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Treatment options for liver problems often depend on the specific condition diagnosed, such as fatty liver disease, hepatitis, or cirrhosis. 

Common treatment options may include:

1. Lifestyle Changes: This includes adopting a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol and drugs that can harm the liver.
2. Medications: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues, such as antiviral medications for hepatitis.
3. Regular Monitoring: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help monitor the condition and guide treatment decisions.
4. Surgery: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
