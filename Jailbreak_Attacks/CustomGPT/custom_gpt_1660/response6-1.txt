Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your individual financial situation, goals, and tax considerations. Here are some general guidelines to help you determine the best approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a matching contribution for your 401(k), start by contributing enough to receive the full match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Considerations**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which lowers your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA**: Depending on the type of IRA (Traditional or Roth), contributions may be tax-deductible, and Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Interest and dividends generated in these accounts are taxable in the year they are received, and capital gains taxes apply when selling investments.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing in retirement accounts. 

4. **Investment Growth Potential**: Generally, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth due to tax benefits. After maximizing these, consider funding taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity.

5. **Diversification**: Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account to manage risk and optimize returns.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Consider your expected tax bracket in retirement. Having a mix of account types can offer flexibility, allowing you to manage taxes more effectively during withdrawals.

Overall, the best approach is to align your investment strategy with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Consulting a financial advisor may also provide tailored advice for your circumstances.
