Distributing your money effectively among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s an approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k), contribute enough to take full advantage of this benefit first, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contributions to Retirement Accounts**: After securing the employer match, consider contributing to your IRA (Traditional or Roth), depending on your income and tax circumstances. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

3. **Diversify Across Accounts**: If you still have funds available after maxing out your IRA contribution, go back to your 401(k) to increase your contributions. 

4. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for investments that you may want to access more quickly or for goals outside retirement, such as buying a home or funding education. This account can provide liquidity and flexibility while allowing for long-term growth.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Invest in tax-efficient funds in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes. In retirement accounts, you might opt for investments that generate higher returns but may be tax-inefficient when realized outside of tax-advantaged accounts.

6. **Review and Adjust**: Periodically review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and market conditions. Adjust your contributions and investment choices as necessary.

Ultimately, your strategy should align with your current financial situation and long-term goals, so consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
