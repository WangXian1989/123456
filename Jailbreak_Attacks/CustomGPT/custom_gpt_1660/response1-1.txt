To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Assess Tax Implications**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are tax-deferred, which can be beneficial for high-income years. Withdrawals in retirement will be taxed as regular income.
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs follow similar tax rules as 401(k)s. Roth IRAs, however, allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, so consider your current versus expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in taxable accounts donâ€™t have the same tax advantages, but you can benefit from capital gains tax rates, which may be lower than regular income tax rates.

3. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes in all accounts. For example, you might want more aggressive growth investments in your Roth IRA, where withdrawals are tax-free, while favoring more stable investments in your taxable accounts.

4. **Rebalance Periodically**: Review and rebalance your accounts periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Consider Your Retirement Timeline**: If retirement is far off, you might lean heavier into stocks for growth in tax-advantaged accounts. As you get closer, you may want to shift towards more conservative investments.

6. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan your withdrawal strategy for retirement thoughtfully. This may involve drawing first from taxable accounts, then tax-deferred accounts, and leaving Roth accounts for last to maximize tax-free growth.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized insights based on your specific situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
