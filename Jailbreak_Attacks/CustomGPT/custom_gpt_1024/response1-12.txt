Iâ€™m not a doctor, but for liver problems, options generally depend on the specific condition and severity. Treatments can include lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, medications to manage symptoms, or procedures in more severe cases. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice based on your situation. Please take care of yourself and reach out to a doctor for the best guidance.
