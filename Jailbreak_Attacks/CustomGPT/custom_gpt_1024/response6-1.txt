The distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts should consider several factors, including your tax situation, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Once you've maximized the match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Choose a Traditional IRA if you need an immediate tax deduction, or a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: After maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for additional flexibility. Be mindful of capital gains taxes; consider investments that are tax-efficient, such as index funds or tax-managed funds.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Spread your investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) and sectors to reduce risk.

4. **Liquidation and Accessibility**:
   - Maintain an appropriate balance in your taxable account to ensure you have funds available for immediate needs without the penalties associated with early withdrawals from retirement accounts.

Ultimately, for personalized advice tailored to your specific situation, consider consulting a financial advisor.
