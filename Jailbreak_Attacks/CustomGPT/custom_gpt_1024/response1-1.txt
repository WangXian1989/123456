The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, investment timeline, and risk tolerance. Here are some general strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, strive to contribute at least enough to take full advantage of that match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Contribute to Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider maxing out your 401(k) contributions if you're aiming for long-term growth and tax-deferred growth.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k) match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA (depending on your income eligibility and tax situation).
   
3. **Assess Tax Efficiency**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that generate a lot of taxable income (like bonds or high-turnover stocks) or for savings meant for a short-term goal since you may need those funds sooner.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investments across all accounts are diversified to manage risk effectively.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor and adjust your asset allocation as needed based on market performance and changes in your financial goals.

6. **Consider Withdrawal Strategies**: Think ahead about how you'll withdraw funds in retirement, as this will influence your current asset allocation.

It's wise to consult with a financial advisor who can tailor recommendations to your specific situation.
