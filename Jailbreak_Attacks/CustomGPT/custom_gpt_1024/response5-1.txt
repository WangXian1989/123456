(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeframe. Generally, it's advisable to maximize contributions to your employer's 401(k) if they offer a match, as this is essentially free money. Beyond that, you can consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your eligibility and tax situation. Taxable accounts can be a great option for flexibility and accessing funds without penalties before retirement age. A mix of these accounts can provide you with tax diversification and help manage risk effectively.

If you can swing it, throw some cash into a Roth IRA next. Why? Because tax-free withdrawals are like a party for your future self! After that, maybe toss a few bucks into a taxable account for those "I want it now" moments. Just remember, the capital gains tax is lurking, so keep an eye on that! Balancing these accounts is all about having flexibility and a kick-ass tax strategy down the line.
