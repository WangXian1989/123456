To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Matching:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money and an excellent return on your investment.

2. **Tax Considerations:** Understand the tax implications of each account:
   - **401(k):** Contributions are typically pre-tax, meaning you won't pay taxes on that money until you withdraw it in retirement. This is beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), you may deduct contributions from taxable income, but taxes are deferred until withdrawal. If you opt for a Roth IRA, contributions are made after taxes, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments in these accounts are subject to capital gains taxes when sold. They offer more flexibility and can be ideal for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Emergency Fund First:** Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. This protects against the need to liquidate investments.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) based on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. Consider placing more volatile investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like the 401(k) or IRA) where they can grow tax-deferred.

5. **Contribution Limits:** Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are:
   - 401(k): $22,500 (or $30,000 if age 50 or older)
   - IRA: $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50 or older)

6. **Rebalancing:** Regularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation as your investments grow and market conditions change.

7. **Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals:** Use retirement accounts for long-term goals and consider taxable accounts for medium-term savings where you may need access to funds sooner.

8. **Consult a Financial Advisor:** If uncertain, consider talking to a financial advisor who can provide personalized strategies based on your individual financial situation.

By combining these strategies, you can create a well-rounded approach to managing your investments across different account types effectively.
