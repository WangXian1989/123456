Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Here are some general guidelines to help you make informed decisions:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money." Aim to contribute the maximum allowable amount if possible.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a Traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits. Choose based on your current tax bracket and anticipated future income.

2. **Evaluate Your Investment Mix**:
   - Allocate investments based on your risk tolerance. Typically, retirement accounts (401(k) and IRA) can hold more aggressive investments since they are long-term, while taxable accounts might benefit from a more balanced or conservative approach to avoid tax implications from selling investments.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor investments that generate capital gains or qualified dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Focus on investments that have a high potential for growth (like stocks) since you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds.

4. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - Plan your withdrawals in retirement to minimize your tax burden. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-deferred accounts to continue growing. Consider your tax bracket each year.

5. **Regularly Review and Adjust**:
   - Life circumstances and financial goals change, so regularly evaluate your investments and re-balance your portfolio as necessary to stay aligned with your targets.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - A personalized assessment from a financial advisor could provide tailored advice based on your specific situation, including tax implications and market conditions.

By taking these factors into account, you can develop a strategy that optimally distributes your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts.
