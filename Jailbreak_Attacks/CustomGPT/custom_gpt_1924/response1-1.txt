When it comes to distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, a balanced approach can help you maximize your savings and manage your tax liability. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: If your employer offers a matching contribution, aim to contribute enough to get the full match first, as this is essentially “free money.” Consider maxing out your contributions if it aligns with your financial goals.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing your employer match, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The choice between the two depends on whether you prefer tax-deferred growth (Traditional IRA) or tax-free withdrawals in retirement (Roth IRA).

3. **Taxable Accounts**: If you have additional funds to invest after maxing out your retirement accounts, consider putting money into taxable investment accounts. These accounts can offer flexibility, as you can access funds without penalties. It's also a good place for investments that are more tax-efficient, such as index funds or ETFs.

4. **Diversification**: Regardless of the account type, ensure that your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors to manage risk.

5. **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and rebalance your accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation as market conditions change.

It's essential to align your distribution strategy with your overall financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. You might also want to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.
