When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits:** Know the contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the 401(k) limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you're over 50). The IRA limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you're over 50). Ensure you maximize contributions to take full advantage of tax benefits.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money. Next, consider maxing out your IRA, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA, which can provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. After that, return to your 401(k) to continue contributing up to the limit.

3. **Assess Your Tax Situation:** Taxable accounts should be used for funds you'll need access to before retirement age, as withdrawing from retirement accounts early can incur penalties. Investing in taxable accounts may be beneficial for holding investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.

4. **Diversify Your Investments:** Within each account, strive for diversification across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.). Your asset allocation should align with your risk tolerance, investment timeline, and financial goals.

5. **Revisit Your Strategy Regularly:** Periodically review and rebalance your investments to ensure they align with your retirement goals and risk appetite. Changes in your financial situation, market conditions, or retirement plans may necessitate adjustments.

By following these strategies, you can create a balanced and effective distribution of your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts to optimize your retirement savings.
