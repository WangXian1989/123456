Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** If your employer offers a match on your 401(k) contributions, try to contribute enough to receive the full match. This is essentially "free money" and a great way to enhance your retirement savings.

2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional):** Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA:** Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free (provided certain conditions are met).
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Investments are subject to capital gains tax when sold. Consider holding onto investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Investment Choices:** Each account type may offer different investment options. Typically, you may want to allocate higher-risk investments (like stocks) in accounts with potential tax advantages (such as IRAs or Roth IRAs), and more stable investments in taxable accounts.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy:** As you approach retirement, consider how you will withdraw funds from these accounts. A typical strategy might involve withdrawing from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.

5. **Diversification:** Ensure that your overall portfolio is diversified in terms of asset allocation and account types to minimize risk and adapt to market changes.

6. **Regular Reviews:** Check your allocations regularly and adjust as necessary depending on changes in your income, tax laws, and financial goals.
