Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: First, contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you have a high tax burden now, focus on maxing out contributions, especially if you can do pre-tax contributions.
   - **Traditional IRA**: Consider contributing here if you're eligible for tax deductions and want to lower your taxable income.

3. **Roth Accounts**: If you're eligible, consider Roth IRAs or Roth 401(k)s for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for additional savings or investment beyond tax-advantaged accounts. They can be useful for flexibility, but keep in mind capital gains taxes.

5. **Diversification and Time Horizon**: Depending on your age and risk tolerance, you might want more aggressive investments in your taxable account and more conservative ones in your retirement accounts, or vice versa.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Make sure to regularly review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.
