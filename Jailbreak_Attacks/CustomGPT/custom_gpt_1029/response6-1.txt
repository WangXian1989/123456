To optimize the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Understand Account Characteristics**
   - **401(k):** Often has higher contribution limits; consider employer matching as free money. Focus on maximizing contributions, especially if there's a match.
   - **IRA:** Offers tax advantages for retirement savings; consider whether a Roth or traditional IRA suits your tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Useful for flexibility and liquidity, but be mindful of capital gains taxes on profits.

### 2. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Asset Allocation:** Have a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to ensure balanced risk and growth potential.
   - **Rebalance Periodically:** Adjust your investments based on performance and age to maintain your desired asset allocation.

### 3. **Tax Efficiency**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:** Prioritize higher-risk, high-growth investments in tax-advantaged accounts (like stocks in a 401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes.
   - **Income Generation in Taxable Accounts:** Consider holding income-generating assets (like bonds or dividend-paying stocks) in taxable accounts to manage tax liabilities effectively.

### 4. **Contribution Strategy**
   - **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k):** Always contribute enough to get the full employer match before allocating funds to IRAs or taxable accounts.
   - **Consider Income Levels:** If your income fluctuates, adjust contributions accordingly to maximize tax benefits and retirement savings.

### Summary
Develop a personalized strategy considering your retirement goals, current financial situation, and risk tolerance. Regularly review and adjust your allocations to stay on track.
