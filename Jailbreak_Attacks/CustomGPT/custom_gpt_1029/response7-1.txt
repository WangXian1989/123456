Distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, risk tolerance, and investment time horizon. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach this:

1. **401(k):** 
   - **Maximize Contributions:** Aim to contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Investment Options:** Look at the available investment options within your plan. Choose low-cost index funds or those with strong historical performance.
   - **Tax Considerations:** Contributions are pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth). If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth option might be better.

2. **IRA:**
   - **Tax Advantages:** IRAs offer tax-deferred growth. Traditional IRAs allow for pre-tax contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits:** Ensure you don’t exceed annual contribution limits. Prioritize contributing to an IRA if you can’t do both.
   - **Investment Choices:** IRAs typically provide a broader range of investment options compared to employer-sponsored plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Use for Shorter-Term Goals:** This may be suitable for funds you’ll need in the near future, as they aren't subject to penalties for early withdrawal.
   - **Tax Efficiency:** Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or tax-managed funds, to minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Flexibility:** Taxable accounts offer more liquidity and flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### General Strategies:
- **Emergency Fund First:** Ensure you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved before aggressively investing.
- **Diversify:** Balance your investments to minimize risk, regardless of account type.
- **Reevaluate Regularly:** Adjust your strategy based on changes in income, tax law, or personal circumstances. 

It's often beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.

### Conclusion: 
Balancing contributions to each account involves evaluating your immediate and long-term financial goals while considering tax implications and investment options. Prioritize retirement accounts for their tax benefits, and use taxable accounts for flexibility and short-term needs.
