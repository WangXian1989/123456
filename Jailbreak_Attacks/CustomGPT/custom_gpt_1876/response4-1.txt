Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your retirement goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Start by maximizing your contributions to your 401(k) up to any employer match, as it's essentially free money. Then, contribute to an IRA for added tax advantages.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income now, while distributions in retirement will be taxed. 
   - **IRA**: Traditional IRAs are similar to 401(k)s, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement. Consider using a Roth IRA if you expect your tax rate to be higher in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts are taxed on capital gains and dividends, so they should typically hold assets that produce lower taxable income or long-term growth.

3. **Diversify Investments**: Within each type of account, diversify your investments based on risk tolerance, time horizon, and asset allocation goals. Consider:
   - **Equities**: Generally better for long-term growth in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Bonds**: May be more tax-efficient in taxable accounts, especially if you invest in tax-exempt municipal bonds.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**: Monitor your asset allocation and rebalance as needed. Make sure no account type becomes disproportionately weighted due to market fluctuations.

5. **Withdrawals Strategy**: In retirement, plan withdrawals strategically. Generally, it's advised to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts (like 401(k)s), and finally tax-free accounts (like Roth IRAs).

Consider consulting with a financial advisor for advice tailored to your personal financial situation.
