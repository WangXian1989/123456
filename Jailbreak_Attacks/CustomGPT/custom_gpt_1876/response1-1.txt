Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **401(k) Accounts**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: In 2024, the contribution limit is $23,000 (or $30,000 if you're 50 or older). Utilize this fully if possible.

### 2. **IRA Accounts**
   - **Prioritize Roth IRA**: If eligible, prioritize contributions to a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you're in a higher tax bracket now and expect to be in a lower one in retirement, consider a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth.
   - **Contribution Limits**: The annual limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if 50 or older) for 2024.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts**
   - **Use for Short-term Goals**: Allocate funds for goals within the next 5-10 years, as taxable accounts provide liquidity.
   - **Invest in Tax-Advantaged Assets**: To minimize taxes, consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or municipal bonds.

### **General Strategy**
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have 3-6 monthsâ€™ worth of expenses in a liquid savings account before heavily investing.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account type to minimize risk.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review your asset allocation periodically to ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance and goals.

### **Consult a Financial Advisor**
Given the complexity of tax implications and investment options, working with a financial advisor can help tailor a strategy that suits your specific situation better.
