It's great that you're thinking strategically about your investments! Here’s a general framework for distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

### 1. **Assess Contribution Limits:**
   - **401(k):** Max out employer match first, as it's essentially free money. The 2023 limit is $22,500 ($30,000 if you're over 50).
   - **IRA:** Consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, which is $6,500 ($7,500 if over 50) for 2023.

### 2. **Tax Considerations:**
   - **401(k):** Contributions are made pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Consider using this for high-growth investments since taxes are deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Traditional IRA:** Similar tax benefits to a 401(k). If you're eligible for deductions, this may also be a good option for larger growth investments.
   - **Roth IRA:** If you qualify, consider this for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which is beneficial for any anticipated income growth.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that pay dividends or interest, as well as for short-term savings goals since you’ll be taxed on dividends and capital gains in the year earned.

### 3. **Investment Strategy:**
   - **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on longer-term investments like stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs. Aim for a diversified portfolio that aligns with your risk appetite and retirement timeline.
   - **Taxable Account:** Choose investments that yield lower taxes, such as index funds or ETFs that you plan to hold for the long term to minimize capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Regular Rebalancing:**
   - Review and adjust your portfolio allocation periodically (annually is a common approach) to stay aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

### 5. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - For tailored advice that takes into account your unique financial situation, a financial advisor can provide personalized insights.

### Summary
Distributing your money effectively involves balancing your contributions across these accounts based on tax implications, growth potential, and your retirement goals. Start with your 401(k) to capture any matching contributions, then move to your IRA, and use taxable accounts for specific needs and tax-efficient investments.
