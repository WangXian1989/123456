Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**:
     - Contribute enough to get any employer match (this is essentially free money).
     - Aim to maximize contributions if possible, especially if your income places you in a higher tax bracket.
   - **Traditional IRA**:
     - Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA if you qualify for tax deductions. This allows your investment to grow tax-deferred.
   - **Roth IRA**:
     - If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Evaluate Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, especially if you anticipate needing funds before retirement.
   - Consider tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, that generate lower taxable income.

3. **Diversification**:
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk and take advantage of various asset classes.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawal strategy in advance. Generally, it may be more tax-efficient to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred accounts, and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

5. **Consult with a Financial Advisor**:
   - A professional can provide personalized advice based on your unique circumstances, ensuring your asset allocation aligns with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

By strategically distributing your contributions and managing withdrawals, you can optimize the growth of your investments while minimizing taxes.
