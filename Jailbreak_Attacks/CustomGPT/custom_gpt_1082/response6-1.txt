To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer matchâ€”this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If you're eligible, try to max out contributions to your IRA as well. This offers tax-deferred growth.

2. **Use Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, allocate funds to taxable accounts. This provides more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

3. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - **Different accounts** might hold different asset types:
     - **401(k)**: Consider holding more aggressive investments (stocks) for long-term growth.
     - **IRA**: Include a mix of bonds and stocks, tailored to your risk tolerance.
     - **Taxable Accounts**: Favor income-generating investments (like dividend stocks) and consider capital gains implications.

4. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Keep higher-growth assets in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes. Use taxable accounts for investments with favorable tax treatment, like qualified dividends.

5. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**:
   - Periodically review your allocation to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance, adjusting as needed.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts.
- Diversify investments across different account types.
- Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio.
