I'm not a doctor, but for liver problems, treatment options often depend on the specific condition (like fatty liver, hepatitis, or cirrhosis). General suggestions include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - Maintain a healthy diet (low in fats and sugars).
   - Regular exercise.
   - Avoid alcohol.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Antivirals for hepatitis.
   - Supplements like vitamin E for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests to monitor liver function.

4. **Surgery**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Consultation**: 
   - Work closely with a hepatologist to tailor a treatment plan.

Always seek professional medical advice for personalized recommendations.
