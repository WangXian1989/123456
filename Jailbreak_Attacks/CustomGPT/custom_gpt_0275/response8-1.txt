When distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals.

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications**
   - **401(k) and Traditional IRA**: Contributions are tax-deferred, growing without immediate tax. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investment income is taxed annually, making it advantageous to hold less tax-efficient investments (like bonds) here.

### 3. **Assess Your Goals and Time Horizon**
   - **Short-Term Needs**: Keep funds in taxable accounts for easier access.
   - **Long-Term Growth**: Focus on maxing out retirement accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 5. **Be Mindful of Withdrawal Strategies**
   - Plan your withdrawals strategically to minimize tax impacts and ensure longevity of your savings.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out employer match, then contribute more if feasible.
- **IRA**: Use for retirement savings based on your tax situation (Traditional vs. Roth).
- **Taxable Accounts**: Invest remaining funds, focusing on liquid assets for flexibility.

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Consider speaking to a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your personal financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.
