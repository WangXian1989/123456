Distributing your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Consider Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA)**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - If you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for investments. This provides flexibility for withdrawals without penalties, although you’ll pay capital gains tax on earnings.

### 4. **Asset Allocation**
   - Place more tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient (like bonds or REITs) in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Adjust your allocations periodically based on performance and changing financial goals.

### Example Allocation Strategy:
- **40% 401(k)** (maxing out to the match)
- **30% IRA** 
- **30% Taxable Account**

### Consult a Financial Advisor
Tailor your strategy to your unique situation, including age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

By following this framework, you can optimize your investments for growth, tax efficiency, and retirement readiness.
