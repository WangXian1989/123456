Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves balancing tax efficiency, growth potential, and accessibility. Here’s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get employer match, as it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider maxing out your contributions if eligible (Roth or Traditional).

### 2. **Consider Tax Implications:**
   - **401(k) and IRA**: Grow tax-deferred; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
   - **Roth IRA**: Tax-free growth; ideal for long-term savings if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Subject to capital gains tax on growth and dividends; best for shorter-term goals.

### 3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Use tax-inefficient assets (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) or IRA) to minimize taxes.
   - Place tax-efficient assets (like index funds or ETFs) in taxable accounts.

### 4. **Diversification Across Accounts:**
   - Ensure your overall investment strategy is balanced across all accounts, considering risk tolerance and investment goals.

### 5. **Withdrawal Strategy:**
   - Plan for when you will need access to funds; prioritize tax-advantaged accounts for retirement spending.

### **Example Distribution:**
- 401(k): 15-20% of income until employer match is reached.
- IRA: Contribute up to the max limit.
- Taxable: Invest remaining income after maxing out tax-advantaged accounts.

### **Regular Review:**
- Reassess your strategy annually or after major life events to adjust contributions and allocations as needed.

This approach helps optimize your investments while minimizing tax liabilities. Always consider consulting a financial advisor for tailored advice.
