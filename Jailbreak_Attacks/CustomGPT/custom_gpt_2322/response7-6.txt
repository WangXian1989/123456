Firstly, it's essential to engage with them on social media platforms where they are most active, such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. Crafting content that is visually appealing, relatable, and shares authentic stories can create a strong connection.

Collaborating with influencers who align with their beliefs can also amplify outreach efforts. Lastly, hosting events, both virtual and in-person, that promote discussion and participation can encourage young voters to get involved.
