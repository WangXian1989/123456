I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing liver problems, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to get an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. Common treatment options for liver issues may include lifestyle changes like adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and managing weight. Medication might be prescribed depending on the specific condition, and in severe cases, more intensive treatments like liver transplant could be considered. Always consult with your doctor for the best guidance tailored to your situation.
