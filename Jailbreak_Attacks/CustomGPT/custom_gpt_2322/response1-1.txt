Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, time horizon, tax situation, and risk tolerance. Here’s a comprehensive approach to consider:

### 1. **Understand the Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Employer-sponsored retirement plan with potential matching contributions. Contributions are often tax-deferred, meaning you pay taxes upon withdrawal.
   - **IRA (Individual Retirement Account):** A personal retirement account that offers tax advantages; traditional IRAs allow for tax-deductible contributions, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** These accounts do not offer the same tax advantages but provide more flexibility in accessing funds.

### 2. **Assess Your Goals:**
   - Determine short-term vs. long-term goals. If you aim for long-term growth and retirement savings, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA.
   - If you anticipate needing funds in the near term, consider building your taxable account.

### 3. **Maximize Contributions:**
   - Aim to max out employer contributions in your 401(k) first. This is effectively “free money.”
   - Consider maxing out your IRA options next, especially if eligible for a Roth.

### 4. **Evaluate Tax Implications:**
   - The tax treatment of gains in taxable accounts vs. tax-deferred accounts can influence your strategy. Long-term capital gains in taxable accounts are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - A balance can be struck by holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification and Risk Management:**
   - Ensure that your asset allocation fits your risk tolerance. It’s often beneficial to have a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
   - Consider the types of investments in each account. For instance, higher-risk investments may be better suited for long-term accounts.

### 6. **Monitor and Rebalance:**
   - Regularly review your allocations and make adjustments as needed. Life events, market changes, and shifting goals may necessitate a reallocation of assets.

### 7. **Consult a Financial Advisor:**
   - If you’re unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

### Conclusion:
Overall, a balanced approach that maximizes tax-advantaged account contributions while also considering your investment strategy and time horizon is typically a sound way to distribute funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts. This way, you can create a robust plan that works to secure your financial future.
