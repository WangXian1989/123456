Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors such as your financial goals, tax implications, and investment horizon. Here's a basic framework to help guide your decision-making process:

1. **Understand the Accounts**: 
   - **401(k)**: This is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that often comes with matching contributions. The contributions are pre-tax, which can reduce your taxable income for the year. It's a great account to prioritize if your employer offers a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Individual Retirement Accounts come in two main types. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions, and taxes are paid upon withdrawal during retirement. Roth IRAs allow for after-tax contributions, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are tax-free. The choice between these often depends on your current versus expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These accounts do not have the same tax advantages as retirement accounts but offer more flexibility in terms of withdrawals and investment options. The gains are taxed at capital gains rates, which can be lower than ordinary income rates.

2. **Consider Your Goals**:
   - If retirement is your primary goal, maximizing contributions to your 401(k) and either type of IRA (especially if you're getting a match or tax benefits) should be your priority.
   - If you have short-term goals (like buying a house or funding an emergency fund), then funds may need to be allocated to a taxable account where you can access them without penalties.

3. **Evaluate Tax Implications**:
   - Generally, itâ€™s advisable to contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture any employer match. After that, consider your tax situation and retirement goals to determine whether to focus on a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial. Conversely, if you expect lower income in retirement, a Traditional IRA might save you more in taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure that your investments are diversified across account types to enhance your overall financial security. 

5. **Revisit Regularly**:
   - As your financial situation changes (income increases, life events, etc.), adjust your contributions and allocations accordingly.

Ultimately, the ideal distribution will depend on your unique circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized insight tailored to your situation.
