To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these key strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. It’s free money!

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are often tax-deferred, which can lower your taxable income now.
   - **IRA**: Depending on whether it’s traditional or Roth, it can provide tax benefits now or in retirement.

3. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider prioritizing Roth accounts (like a Roth IRA) for tax-free withdrawals later.
   
4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use your 401(k) and IRA for long-term growth investments like stocks or index funds.
   - Keep more liquid and lower-risk investments (like bonds or cash) in taxable accounts, especially if you might need access before retirement.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired risk level and investment goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: If you’re unsure, they can offer personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals.

By following these steps, you can optimize your investment strategy for both growth and tax efficiency.
