I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest that you consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. They might recommend treatments like medication, lifestyle changes, or possibly procedures depending on the specific liver condition you're facing. It's important to get a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your needs.
