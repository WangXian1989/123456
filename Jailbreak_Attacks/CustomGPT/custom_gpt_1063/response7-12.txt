I'm sorry to hear about your liver problem. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. However, general treatment options can include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, losing weight if overweight, and avoiding alcohol.
2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition (e.g., hepatitis, fatty liver disease), medications might be prescribed.
3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests to monitor the condition.
4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures like liver transplant may be considered.

Please consult your doctor for tailored recommendations and treatment plans.
