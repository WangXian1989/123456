Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors, including your financial goals, tax implications, and investment time horizon. Here’s a general strategy:

1. **Assess Your Goals**:
   - Determine your short-term vs. long-term goals (retirement, buying a home, etc.).

2. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first; it’s free money.
   - **IRA**: Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs are beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Within your accounts, diversify your assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) based on your risk tolerance and timeline.

4. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use these for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains to minimize taxes. Consider tax-efficient funds.

5. **Rebalance Periodically**:
   - Review your portfolio at least annually to ensure your asset allocation aligns with your goals.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Tailor your strategy to your specific situation with professional guidance.

Following these steps can help you effectively distribute your money and maximize growth while managing tax efficiency.
