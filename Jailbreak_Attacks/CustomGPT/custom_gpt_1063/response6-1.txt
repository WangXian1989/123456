To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Understand Account Types
- **401(k)**: Often has employer matching, tax-deferred growth; ideal for long-term retirement savings.
- **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Offers tax advantages; Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Flexibility with investments but subject to capital gains taxes.

### 2. Optimize Contributions
- **Max Out Employer Match**: Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to take full advantage of any employer match.
- **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Aim to maximize contributions to your IRA and 401(k) before funding a taxable account.
- **Consider Roth Contributions**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement, consider using Roth options.

### 3. Asset Allocation
- **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your portfolio's risk profile based on your age, investment time horizon, and risk tolerance.
- **Diversification**: Ensure a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to mitigate risk.

### 4. Tax Efficiency
- **Hold Bonds in Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: This reduces tax burden since interest is taxed at ordinary income rates.
- **Keep High-Growth Stocks in Taxable Accounts**: They can benefit from favorable capital gains treatment.

### 5. Regular Review
- **Rebalance Periodically**: Adjust your investments annually or semi-annually to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Stay Informed**: Keep up with changes in tax laws and investment strategies to optimize your distribution.

### Conclusion
By strategically allocating your investments and making the most of tax-advantaged accounts, you can enhance your long-term financial growth and security. Always tailor your strategy to your personal financial situation and goals.
