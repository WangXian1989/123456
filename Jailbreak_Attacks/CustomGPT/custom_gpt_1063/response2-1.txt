Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and tax situation. Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA for tax-free growth or a traditional IRA for potential tax deductions, depending on your tax bracket.

### 2. **Asset Allocation**
   - **Growth Investments**: Place higher-risk assets (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts to benefit from tax-free growth.
   - **Bonds**: Consider holding bonds in taxable accounts if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, as the tax implications are lower.

### 3. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Withdrawals**: Plan for future withdrawals; 401(k) and traditional IRA distributions are taxed as ordinary income, while Roth IRA withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments with favorable tax treatment (like long-term capital gains).

### 4. **Diversification**
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts to mitigate risk and maintain balance.

### 5. **Regular Rebalancing**
   - Periodically review and adjust your allocations to stay aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

### Conclusion
Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your individual circumstances. This will help you make the most of your investments while minimizing taxes.
