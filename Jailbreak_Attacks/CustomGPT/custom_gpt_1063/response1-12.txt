1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet low in saturated fats, sugar, and salt.
   - **Weight Loss**: If overweight, aim for gradual weight loss.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**:
   - Depending on the condition, medications may include antiviral drugs for hepatitis or medications to manage symptoms.

3. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol and Toxins**: 
   - Avoid alcohol and limit exposure to potential liver toxins.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: 
   - Some patients explore supplements or herbal remedies, but these should be discussed with a healthcare professional first.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and personalized treatment plan.
