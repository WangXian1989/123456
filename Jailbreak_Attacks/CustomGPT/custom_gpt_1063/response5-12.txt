I'm not a doctor, but I can offer some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems vary depending on the specific condition. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support liver health.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight and improve liver function.
   - **Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol consumption is crucial for liver health.

2. **Medication**: 
   - Depending on the liver issue (like hepatitis or fatty liver disease), doctors may prescribe medications to manage symptoms or treat the underlying cause.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: 
   - Regular check-ups and blood tests can help monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Procedures**: 
   - In some cases, procedures like liver biopsy or, in severe cases, liver transplant may be necessary.

It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment.
