It's great that you're thinking about how to distribute your money! Just a reminder, though: my advice is based on general principles and shouldn't replace a consultation with a financial advisor who understands your unique situation. 

Generally, a balanced approach involves:

1. **401(k):** If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that full match first—it’s essentially free money! After that, consider maxing out contributions if you can, as these funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal.

2. **IRA:** After maximizing employer matches, consider contributing to a Traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is particularly appealing if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire since you pay taxes on your contributions now, not at withdrawal.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** These are typically used for money you might need before retirement or to achieve specific goals (like buying a house). They can offer more flexibility but are subject to capital gains taxes.

A common strategy is to prioritize high-interest debt repayment before maxing out retirement accounts. 

For more specific recommendations, it may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can personalize a strategy based on your financial goals and tax situation!
