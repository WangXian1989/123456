I'm glad you're seeking guidance on investment strategies! However, please remember that my advice is based on general knowledge and shouldn't replace professional financial consultation.

When distributing your money amongst a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, here are some considerations:

1. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k) and IRA**: These accounts often provide tax advantages, such as tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals in the case of a Roth IRA. Prioritize contributions to these accounts to maximize tax benefits.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments in these accounts may be subject to capital gains taxes, so consider placing investments that generate income or short-term gains here last.

2. **Contribution Limits**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Ensure you are maximizing contributions to your 401(k) (especially if there's an employer match) and your IRA within the annual limits.
   - **Balance Contributions**: After maximizing tax-advantaged accounts, distribute remaining funds to taxable accounts for liquidity.

3. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**:
   - **Long-term Growth**: Focus on growth-oriented investments in tax-advantaged accounts.
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Keep more liquid or short-term investments in taxable accounts.

It might also be helpful to assess your overall financial situation, including your risk tolerance, investment goals, and any upcoming financial needs. Consider consulting with a financial advisor for tailored advice.
