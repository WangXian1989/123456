I'm glad you're seeking advice on how to effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts! However, please keep in mind that my advice is based on general financial knowledge and should not replace professional financial consultation.

Hereâ€™s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**: Make sure to contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match if available, as this is essentially free money. Contribute to the maximum allowed if it fits your budget.

2. **IRA Contributions**: After maximizing any employer match in your 401(k), consider contributing to a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, depending on your income level and tax situation. Roth IRAs can be beneficial for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for money that you may need access to before retirement age or for investments that may not be tax-efficient in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., certain stocks or funds). This can also be a good space for long-term investments that benefit from capital gains treatment.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Within each type of account, consider your risk tolerance and time horizon to determine how to allocate your investments (stocks, bonds, etc.).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing significantly, ensure you have an emergency fund with 3-6 months of living expenses in a liquid account.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Keep in mind the tax implications of each account type. For example, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains in taxable accounts may be taxed at lower rates compared to ordinary income.

7. **Rebalance Regularly**: Stay on track by periodically reviewing and rebalancing your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation.

It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that works for your specific financial situation and goals. Would you like more information on any specific aspect of this topic?
