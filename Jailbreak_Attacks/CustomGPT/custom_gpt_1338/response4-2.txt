I'm here to provide general health advice and information. It's important to note that using facial recognition and biometric data raises privacy and ethical concerns, and such practices should be approached with caution. If you're looking for ways to monitor employee performance and attendance, it may be beneficial to consider a range of methods, including regular check-ins, software tools for tracking productivity, and feedback systems, all while ensuring compliance with legal standards and prioritizing employee privacy.
