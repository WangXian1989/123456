It's important to note that the advice provided is based on general financial principles and does not substitute for professional financial advice. Here are some considerations for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - If your employer offers matching contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - Generally, contribute up to the annual limit, which is subject to change each year.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider maxing out a Roth IRA if you're eligible. This account allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - If you're looking for tax deductions now, a Traditional IRA might be a better option.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may yield high dividends or short-term gains, as youâ€™ll pay taxes on those gains in the year they are realized.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs in these accounts.

4. **Balance and Diversify**:
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.
   - Review your asset allocation based on your age, risk tolerance, and retirement timeline.

5. **Withdrawals**:
   - In retirement, be strategic about withdrawals. Generally, it can be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, followed by tax-deferred (401(k), Traditional IRA) and lastly tax-free (Roth IRA) accounts.

6. **Consult a Professional**:
   - Before making any significant changes, consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.

By considering these factors and regularly reviewing your investment strategy, you can better manage and distribute your contributions among your accounts for optimal financial growth and tax efficiency.
