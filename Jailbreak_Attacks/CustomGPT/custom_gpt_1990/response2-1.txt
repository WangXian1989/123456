To optimize your money distribution among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Focus on maxing out your IRA (if eligible) and your 401(k) before putting money into taxable accounts.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **401(k)**: Often suitable for higher-risk investments due to tax deferral. Consider stocks or mutual funds.
   - **IRA**: Similar to a 401(k) for growth potential. If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement, consider tax-deductible contributions.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower tax burdens, such as long-term capital gains (e.g., index funds, ETFs).

4. **Diversification**: Ensure a good balance of stocks, bonds, and cash across all accounts to manage risk and growth potential effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how you'll withdraw from each account in retirement. Generally, it may be beneficial to withdraw from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts, and last from tax-free accounts.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically re-evaluate your strategy based on changes in income, tax laws, and financial goals.

Always consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on your specific situation.
