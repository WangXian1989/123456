To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - **Max Out IRAs**: If you qualify, contribute the maximum to your traditional or Roth IRA. Roth IRAs are especially valuable for tax-free growth.
   - **401(k) Contributions**: After funding your IRA, continue maximizing your 401(k) contributions if feasible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for funds you may need in the short term, as they allow more flexibility. These accounts are best for investments with favorable long-term capital gains treatment.

4. **Investment Types**:
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Place investments with high turnover (like actively managed funds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxes.
   - **Bond Funds**: Consider keeping bond funds in tax-advantaged accounts to shelter interest income.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Adjust contributions based on your current and anticipated future tax brackets. Higher income might prioritize tax-deferred growth.

6. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts to cover unexpected expenses.

7. **Annual Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on performance and changes in your financial situation.
