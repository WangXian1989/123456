To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; aim for the annual limit if possible.
   - **IRA**: Open a Roth or traditional IRA based on your tax situation; contribute the maximum allowed.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate capital gains or dividends, as they can be more tax-efficient long-term.

3. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets across all accounts to help balance risk and returns.

4. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your allocations to ensure they align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

5. **Emergency Fund**:
   - Maintain a separate emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid tapping into retirement savings prematurely.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help optimize your strategy based on your unique situation.

This balanced approach can enhance growth while potentially minimizing taxes.
