To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Aim to contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Diversify Investments**: Choose a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth IRA**:
     - **Traditional IRA**: Contributions may be tax-deductible; taxes are paid upon withdrawal.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If eligible, contribute the maximum allowed annually.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest for Flexibility**: Use this account for investments that might require access before retirement.
   - **Consider Tax Efficiency**: Favor tax-efficient investments (like index funds) to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have savings for emergencies, ideally 3-6 months of living expenses.
- **Balance for Age**: As you age, gradually reduce risk in your portfolio, moving towards more stable investments.
- **Rebalance Regularly**: Review and adjust your portfolio periodically to maintain your desired asset allocation.
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax implications and retirement planning.

This strategy will help you optimize your savings across different accounts.
