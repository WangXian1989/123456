It's essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, but common treatment options for liver problems may include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: A balanced diet low in sugar, saturated fats, and high in fruits and vegetables.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Alcohol Reduction**: Avoiding alcohol to prevent further liver damage, especially in cases of fatty liver disease or alcoholic liver disease.

4. **Regular Monitoring**: Routine blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and detect any changes.

5. **Surgery**: In severe cases, surgical procedures might be necessary, such as a liver transplant for end-stage liver disease.

6. **Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like vitamin E or milk thistle, but these should be discussed with a physician.

Always consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
