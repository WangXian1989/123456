Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here’s a structured approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**:
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If you haven’t maxed out the contributions, consider prioritizing this account until you reach the annual limit.
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for future tax-free growth. If you’re in a higher tax bracket now but expect to be lower in retirement, a traditional IRA may be more beneficial.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maximized contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, consider investing in taxable accounts. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and may take advantage of lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Investment Diversification**:
   - Diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon across all accounts, choosing different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate.

5. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds) in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize taxable income in your taxable accounts.

6. **Regular Review and Rebalance**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to ensure alignment with your financial goals and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If uncertain, consider consulting a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that suits your specific circumstances.

This structured approach will help you create a balanced and tax-efficient investment strategy.
