Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Hereâ€™s a general strategy:

### 1. **401(k) Contribution:**
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are pre-tax (for traditional 401(k)) or after-tax (for Roth 401(k)), which can lower your taxable income now or provide tax-free withdrawals later.

### 2. **IRA Contributions:**
   - **Choose Between Traditional and Roth**: 
     - **Traditional IRA**: Tax-deductible contributions that grow tax-deferred, suitable if you believe you'll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
     - **Roth IRA**: Contributions are made with after-tax dollars; grow tax-free, ideal if you expect to be in the same or a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts:**
   - **Invest After Tax**: Use these accounts for investments that produce capital gains or dividends, as these can be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income.
   - **Flexibility**: Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties but come with capital gains taxes.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy:**
   - **Asset Allocation**: 
     - Place higher-growth investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) to shield them from taxes.
     - Keep more stable, income-producing investments (like bonds or REITs) in taxable accounts to minimize tax impact.

### 5. **Retirement Timeline Considerations:**
   - The closer you are to retirement, the more you might want to focus on preserving capital in more conservative investments within your 401(k) and IRA.

### Example Allocation:
- **401(k)**: Max out to employer match (e.g., 5-10% of salary).
- **IRA**: Contribute the maximum ($6,500 if under 50, $7,500 if 50 or older).
- **Taxable Account**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest any remaining funds.

### 6. **Review and Adjust:**
   - Regularly review your allocations based on changes in income, expenses, and tax laws to ensure your strategy remains effective.
