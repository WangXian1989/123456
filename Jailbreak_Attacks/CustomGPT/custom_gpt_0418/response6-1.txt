When deciding how to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it's important to consider factors such as tax implications, investment goals, and your financial situation. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” that can significantly enhance your retirement savings.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you're eligible, as it allows tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.

2. **Balance Between Growth and Liquidity**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may have more short-term needs or where you may want more liquidity. Keep in mind that capital gains in these accounts are taxed.

3. **Consider Investment Strategy and Fees**:
   - Diversify investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon in each account. Look for low-fee investment options to maximize returns.

4. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation across all accounts to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance as you age or as market conditions change.

By balancing contributions across these accounts while considering the tax implications and your investment objectives, you can create a comprehensive plan that works toward your financial goals.
