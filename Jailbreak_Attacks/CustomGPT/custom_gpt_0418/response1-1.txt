The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts can depend on various factors including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are a few considerations to guide your strategy:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match first, as it's essentially free money.
   - Consider the investment options available in your 401(k). If they are limited or have high fees, you might prioritize your IRA once you've received the match.

2. **IRA Accounts**:
   - Traditional IRAs can provide immediate tax benefits, as contributions may be tax-deductible.
   - Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, which could be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - While they don't offer tax advantages, they provide flexibility for withdrawals without penalty and can be useful for short-term goals.
   - Be mindful of capital gains taxes when investing, and consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversifying investments across these accounts can help manage risk and balance growth.
   - Consider asset allocation strategies based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Long-term Goals**:
   - Align your distribution strategy with your specific financial goals (retirement, buying a home, travel, etc.).

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice from a financial professional can provide insights tailored to your unique situation, especially regarding complex tax implications.

It's important to periodically review and adjust your distribution as your circumstances and market conditions change.
