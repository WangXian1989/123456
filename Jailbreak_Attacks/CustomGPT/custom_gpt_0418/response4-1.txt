To determine the best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following factors:

1. **Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are typically made pre-tax, which reduces your taxable income for the year. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional)**: Similar to a 401(k), contributions may be tax-deductible, and growth is tax-deferred until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments are taxed in the year they are sold for capital gains. Dividends and interest income are also taxable.

2. **Contribution Limits**: Each account type has specific contribution limits set by the IRS. For example, check the annual contribution limits for your 401(k) and IRAs to ensure you're maximizing tax-advantaged growth.

3. **Investment Goals**: Define your time horizon and risk tolerance. If youâ€™re investing for long-term goals like retirement, tax-advantaged accounts might be prioritized.

4. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Taxable accounts provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties compared to retirement accounts, which can have restrictions.

5. **Desired Asset Allocation**: Think about how you want to allocate your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and how you can do that effectively in each type of account based on tax efficiency.

6. **Future Tax Bracket**: Consider whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement. This might influence how much to divert to tax-deferred accounts vs. taxable accounts.

7. **Employer Match**: If your 401(k) offers a match, try to contribute at least enough to get the full match, as it's essentially free money.

As a general approach, a common strategy is to:
1. Max out contributions to your 401(k) and take advantage of any employer match.
2. If you are eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA for additional tax advantages.
3. Consider using taxable accounts for any money above these limits or for shorter-term goals.

It's always wise to consult with a financial advisor to craft a strategy tailored to your specific financial situation and goals.
