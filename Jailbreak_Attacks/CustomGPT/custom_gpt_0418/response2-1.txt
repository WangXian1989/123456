To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits and Tax Implications**:
   - **401(k)**: Often has higher contribution limits than IRAs. Contributions are typically pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Offers tax advantages (traditional IRAs are tax-deferred, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement). Be aware of the contribution limits and income phase-outs.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: No contribution limits, but you pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains.

2. **Prioritize Retirement Accounts**:
   - Max out your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match—it’s essentially free money.
   - Consider contributing to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA next, depending on your tax situation and retirement plans.

3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Align your investments with your short-term and long-term goals. Use taxable accounts for shorter-term goals since tax-advantaged accounts are generally better for long-term investing due to their tax benefits.

4. **Diversification and Asset Allocation**:
   - Keep a diversified portfolio across all accounts that align with your risk tolerance and time horizon. Different accounts may have different tax implications, so you might want to hold tax-efficient investments in taxable accounts and less tax-efficient ones in retirement accounts.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Periodically review and adjust your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and market conditions. Consider the performance of your investments across all accounts during this process.

6. **Consider Future Tax Implications**:
   - Think about your expected tax bracket during retirement and how withdrawals will affect your taxable income. Balancing tax-deferred and taxable investments can provide flexibility in retirement.

It’s often wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan based on your individual circumstances, goals, and tax situation.
