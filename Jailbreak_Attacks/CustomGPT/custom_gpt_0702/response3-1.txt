Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your tax situation, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

2. **Fund Roth IRA**: If you're eligible, consider maxing out contributions to a Roth IRA next. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing out tax-advantaged accounts, consider taxable accounts. They offer greater flexibility for withdrawals, but be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are well-diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts.

5. **Consider Tax Implications**: Be strategic about where you hold certain investments. For example, hold higher growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts to defer taxes on growth.

6. **Review Regularly**: Periodically reassess your allocations based on changes in your financial situation and market conditions.

Consulting a financial advisor can also help tailor a strategy to your specific needs.
