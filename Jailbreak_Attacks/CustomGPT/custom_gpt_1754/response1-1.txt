It's great that you're thinking about how to allocate your investments! When considering the distribution of your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, there are a few important factors to keep in mind. 

1. **Tax Considerations**: Each account has different tax implications. Contributions to a 401(k) and traditional IRAs are typically made with pre-tax dollars, reducing your taxable income, while withdrawals are taxed as income. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars, so qualified withdrawals are tax-free.

2. **Investment Goals and Time Horizon**: Assess what you're saving for—retirement, a house, etc.—and your time horizon. Longer time horizons might allow you to take on more risk in growth-oriented investments.

3. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of the annual contribution limits for each account type, as they can affect how much you can invest each year.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your overall investment strategy is well-diversified across different asset classes and sectors, regardless of the account type.

5. **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Consider when you may need to access your funds. Taxable accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals than retirement accounts.

It might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that fits your personal circumstances. What specific goals do you have in mind with your investments?
