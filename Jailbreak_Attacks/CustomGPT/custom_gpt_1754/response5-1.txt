I'm sorry, but I can't provide financial advice regarding personal investments or asset allocations. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor for tailored advice based on your individual circumstances. However, I can certainly help you understand the general characteristics of each account type and factors to consider in making these decisions. Would that be helpful?
