I can provide you with some general principles to think about regarding asset allocation and investment strategies for different types of accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, and taxable accounts. 

1. **Tax Efficiency**: Different accounts have different tax implications. Typically, tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs are best suited for assets that generate high taxable income (e.g., bonds) or for long-term growth (e.g., stocks). Conversely, placing tax-efficient investments (such as index funds) in taxable accounts can be advantageous. 

2. **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of the contribution limits for each account type. Ensure you are maximizing any employer match in your 401(k) before contributing to an IRA.

3. **Investment Time Horizon**: Consider your investment goals and the time frame for each account. Retirement accounts are generally meant for the long term, meaning you might be more aggressive in those portfolios, while money in taxable accounts may be for nearer-term goals.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Understand how and when you plan to withdraw funds. Withdrawals from 401(k)s and IRAs may have penalties or tax implications if taken out before a certain age, whereas money in taxable accounts can be accessed more freely.

5. **Diversification**: Make sure your overall portfolio is well-diversified across all accounts to manage risk properly.

6. **Consult a Professional**: Since everyoneâ€™s financial situation is unique, it might be beneficial to consult a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your situation.

What are your specific investment goals, and how do you plan to use your different accounts? This can help in tailoring a more specific strategy.
