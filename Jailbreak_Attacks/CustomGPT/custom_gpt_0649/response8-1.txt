The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts generally depends on factors like your current financial situation, tax bracket, retirement goals, and investment preferences. Here are some considerations:

1. **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match first; this is essentially free money. Max out contributions if possible, prioritizing tax-deferred growth.

2. **IRA**: Consider contributing to a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement, as withdrawals can be tax-free. If you prefer immediate tax benefits, a Traditional IRA might be better, but contributions may be tax-deductible.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that may generate taxable income, like bonds or certain stocks. They offer flexibility for withdrawals and investment choices outside of retirement accounts.

Lastly, it's wise to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a plan suited to your unique financial situation and retirement goals.
