The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first; it's free money. Then, focus on maxing out your contributions if possible.
  
2. **IRA:** If you can, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA, depending on your tax situation. Roth IRAs offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement, whereas traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for additional savings and investments, particularly if you’ve maxed out retirement accounts. They offer more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains tax.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Within each account type, diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance and time horizon. Generally, younger investors might have a higher risk tolerance.

5. **Reassess Regularly:** Your financial situation and goals may change, so reassess your distribution strategy regularly.

Consider speaking with a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances.
