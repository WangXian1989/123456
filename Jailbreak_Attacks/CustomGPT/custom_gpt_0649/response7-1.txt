The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors such as your age, retirement goals, and current tax situation. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: 
   - Prioritize contributing enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match.
   - After that, consider maxing out your IRA contributions, especially if itâ€™s a Roth IRA.

2. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - 401(k) and traditional IRAs offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes until you withdraw the funds.
   - Roth IRAs allow tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, making them an excellent choice for long-term growth.
   - Taxable accounts can be beneficial for short-term savings or investing, but they are subject to capital gains taxes.

3. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Determine your risk tolerance and investment timeline to decide how to allocate funds among these accounts.
   - Consider diversifying your investments across both tax-advantaged and taxable accounts to balance for risk and tax efficiency.

4. **Review Regularly**:
   - Revisit your distribution strategy periodically as your income, tax situation, and financial goals change over time.

5. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - For personalized advice tailored to your unique financial situation, consulting a financial advisor can be very helpful.

Always make sure to conduct thorough research or consult with a professional before making significant investment decisions.
