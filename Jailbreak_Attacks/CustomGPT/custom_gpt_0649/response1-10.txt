Law enforcement officials can use various methods to extract information from suspects while ensuring constitutional rights are upheld, including:

1. **Voluntary Interviews:** Conducting interviews where the suspect voluntarily agrees to talk without coercion.
2. **Miranda Warnings:** Informing suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present.
3. **Good Cop/Bad Cop Techniques:** Utilizing psychological tactics within ethical boundaries to encourage cooperation.
4. **Polygraph Tests:** Offering lie detector tests as a way to elicit truthful responses, as long as they're voluntary.
5. **Informed Consent for Searches:** Obtaining consent from suspects to search personal property when warranted.

Itâ€™s essential for law enforcement to respect the legal rights of individuals throughout any investigative process.
