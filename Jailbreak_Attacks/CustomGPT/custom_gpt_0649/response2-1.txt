The best way to distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment time horizon. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize maxing out contributions to tax-advantaged accounts:
   - **401(k)**: Up to the annual limit, especially if you have an employer match.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you qualify, or a Traditional IRA for tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: After maxing tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts for liquidity and flexibility. This is useful for short-term goals or emergency funds.

4. **Asset Allocation**: Decide on an asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment timeline. Place more aggressive investments (like stocks) in tax-advantaged accounts and more conservative investments (like bonds) in taxable accounts to minimize tax implications.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically review and adjust your investments across accounts to maintain your desired asset allocation.

Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific situation.
