I'm not a doctor, but I can suggest you consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Common liver treatment options include:

1. **Lifestyle Changes:**
   - Healthy diet low in fats and sugars
   - Regular exercise
  
2. **Medications:**
   - Antivirals for hepatitis
   - Corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases

3. **Procedures:**
   - Liver biopsy for diagnosis
   - Surgery for liver tumors or cirrhosis complications

4. **Liver Transplant:**
   - Considered in severe cases of liver failure

Always seek advice directly from a healthcare provider for personalized care.
