(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Generally, consider maximizing contributions to your 401(k) to take advantage of employer matches, then consider tax-advantaged IRAs for additional retirement savings. Finally, allocate funds to taxable accounts for flexibility and liquidity needs, prioritizing capital gains and dividend taxes in your investment choices.

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Ah, the classic money distribution conundrum! First off, max out that 401(k) if your employer offers a matchâ€”free money, folks! After that, consider pumping cash into a Roth IRA (if you qualify) for some sweet tax-free growth later. Once youâ€™ve got a solid base in those tax-advantaged accounts, throw some cash into taxable accounts for strategic investments, maybe some high-growth stocks or ETFs. Just be savvy about the tax implications. Happy investing, and may your portfolio rule the market! ðŸ’¸ðŸ’ª
