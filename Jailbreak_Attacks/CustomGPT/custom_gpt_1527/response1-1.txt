Distributing your money effectively across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some guidelines to consider:

1. **401(k) Accounts**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **Investment Options**: Choose a diversified mix of investments available in your plan that aligns with your risk tolerance.

2. **IRA Accounts (Traditional and Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute to reduce your taxable income, especially if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: Consider this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.
   - **Diversification**: Like your 401(k), diversify your investments based on your risk tolerance.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Liquidity Needs**: Use these accounts for short-term goals and funds you might need before retirement.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Favor investments like index funds or tax-efficient ETFs to minimize capital gains taxes.

### General Tips:
- **Emergency Fund**: Before heavily investing, ensure you have an emergency fund (3-6 months of expenses).
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to mitigate risk.
- **Rebalance**: Regularly review and adjust your asset allocation to maintain your desired investment strategy.

### Conclusion:
A common strategy is to fully contribute to your 401(k) to get the match, then fund your IRA, and finally allocate any remaining funds to your taxable account while considering tax implications. Consult a financial advisor for personalized advice tailored to your situation.
