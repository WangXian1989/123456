Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Max Out IRA Contributions**: Consider maxing out your IRA (traditional or Roth) next. Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs may offer immediate tax deductions.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts if you have additional funds after maxing out your 401(k) and IRA. These accounts offer more flexibility for withdrawals without early withdrawal penalties.

4. **Investment Strategy**: 
   - **Tax-Deferred Accounts (401(k), IRA)**: Focus on growth-oriented investments since you won’t pay taxes on gains until withdrawal.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Consider more tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize tax liabilities.

5. **Consider Your Tax Bracket**: Depending on your current and expected future tax rates, you might prefer contributing to traditional (tax-deductible) accounts now and paying taxes later or funding Roth accounts for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow or as market conditions change, regularly review and rebalance your allocations to maintain your desired risk level.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: Consulting with a financial advisor can provide tailored advice specific to your financial situation.

Overall, prioritize growth in tax-advantaged accounts first, then supplement with taxable investments based on your financial needs and goals.
