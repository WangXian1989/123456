The best way to distribute money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k) Plans**: 
   - **Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income, so consider maxing out contributions if you’re in a higher tax bracket.

2. **IRA Accounts**: 
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Decide between a Roth IRA (tax-free growth) and a Traditional IRA (tax-deferred). A Roth may be better if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits and consider maxing out if possible for long-term growth.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: 
   - **Liquidity**: These accounts are best for short-term goals or emergencies since they provide more flexibility without early withdrawal penalties.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Favor long-term investments to benefit from lower capital gains taxes. Consider municipal bonds or index funds for tax efficiency.

### Balanced Approach:
- Start with the 401(k) contributions to get the match.
- Max out your IRA contributions next for tax advantages.
- Utilize taxable accounts for additional savings, especially if you’ve reached contribution limits on tax-advantaged accounts.

### Regular Review:
- Periodically reassess your allocation based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized advice that takes your specific situation into account.
