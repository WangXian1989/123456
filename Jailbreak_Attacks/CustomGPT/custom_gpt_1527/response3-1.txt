Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your age, retirement goals, tax situation, and investment preferences. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match. This is essentially "free money."

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Pre-tax contributions reduce your taxable income, and investments grow tax-deferred.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: A Traditional IRA gives you immediate tax deductions, while a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are more flexible, but you'll pay taxes on dividends and capital gains.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund outside these accounts before investing heavily.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - Short-term goals might be better suited for taxable accounts.
   - Long-term goals can benefit from tax-advantaged accounts.

5. **Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might prioritize aggressive growth in a 401(k) or Roth IRA.
   - As you age, consider decreasing risk, perhaps reallocating to more stable investments in your taxable account.

6. **Diversification**: Maintain a diverse portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

7. **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your allocations based on performance, changing goals, and tax laws.

**Sample Allocation** (adjust based on individual circumstances):
- 401(k): 50%
- IRA (Traditional/Roth): 30%
- Taxable Accounts: 20%
