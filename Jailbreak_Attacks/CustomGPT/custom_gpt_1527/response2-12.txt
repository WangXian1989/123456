I'm not a medical professional, but I can suggest some common treatments for liver problems based on general knowledge. It's crucial to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice. 

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a liver-friendly diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.
   - **Weight Management**: Losing excess weight can help alleviate fatty liver disease.

2. **Medications**: Depending on the specific liver issue, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups can help track liver function and address issues early.

4. **Avoiding Alcohol**: Reducing or eliminating alcohol intake is crucial for liver health.

5. **Herbal Supplements**: Some may benefit from supplements like milk thistle, but consult a doctor before starting any.

6. **Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures like a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always talk to a healthcare professional for a diagnosis and tailored treatment plan.
