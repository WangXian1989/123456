To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Ideal for high-income years.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: 
     - Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
     - Roth IRAs allow tax-free withdrawals in retirement, making them suitable if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later.

3. **Investment Options**: 
   - The investment choices in your 401(k) may be limited compared to IRAs or taxable accounts, so consider investing in higher-growth options there.
   - Use your IRA for a diversified portfolio, including stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
   - Taxable accounts should focus on tax-efficient investments, like index funds or municipal bonds, to minimize taxes on dividends and capital gains.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**: Plan how youâ€™ll withdraw funds in retirement:
   - Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to grow longer.
   - Be mindful of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs starting at age 73.

5. **Regular Review**: Adjust your allocations periodically based on market conditions, changes in income, and financial goals.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide tailored advice based on your unique situation.
