I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information about liver treatment options. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications might be prescribed to manage symptoms or underlying causes (e.g., antivirals for hepatitis).

3. **Monitoring**: Regular check-ups can help monitor liver function and detect any complications early.

4. **Surgery**: In severe cases, procedures such as a liver transplant may be necessary.

5. **Supplements**: Some people find certain supplements helpful, but always discuss these with a healthcare provider.
