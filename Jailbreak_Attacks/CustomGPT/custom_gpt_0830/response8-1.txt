To effectively distribute your money amongst your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: If your 401(k) offers employer matching, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money" and provides immediate returns.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**: Prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like your 401(k) and IRA. Max out your IRA contributions if eligible, then focus on your 401(k).

3. **Diversification**: Ensure your investments are diversified across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts. This reduces overall risk.

4. **Tax Considerations**: 
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. However, withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - **IRA (Traditional and Roth)**: Traditional IRAs offer tax deductions now, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax bracket.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Investments here are taxed on capital gains and dividends. Use these for funds you'll need before retirement.

5. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you maintain an emergency fund outside of these accounts to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

6. **Rebalance Regularly**: Periodically reassess your asset allocation and rebalance as needed to maintain your desired risk profile.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Consider seeking personalized advice based on your financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance.

This balanced approach can help optimize your investments for growth while considering tax implications. By tailoring your strategy to your individual circumstances, you can work towards your financial goals effectively.
