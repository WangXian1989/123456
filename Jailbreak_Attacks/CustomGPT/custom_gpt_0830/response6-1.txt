To effectively allocate your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to capture any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Utilize IRAs to benefit from tax-deferred growth (Traditional) or tax-free withdrawals (Roth).

2. **Account Types and Investment Choices**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on higher growth investments, as you won't pay taxes on gains until withdrawal. Choose low-fee index funds when possible.
   - **IRA**: Diversify your assets here, potentially mixing stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. The choice between Traditional and Roth may depend on your current vs. future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize tax liability on capital gains and dividends. Consider strategies like tax-loss harvesting.

3. **Investment Horizon and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Align your asset allocation with your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Longer-term horizons can typically tolerate more volatility.

4. **Rebalancing Annually**:
   - Regularly assess and adjust your allocations based on performance and changes in your financial situation.

By strategically leveraging the strengths of each account type and maintaining a balanced approach according to your needs, you can optimize your investment outcomes.
