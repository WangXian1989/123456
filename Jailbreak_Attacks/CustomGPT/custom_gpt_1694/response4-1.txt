To provide you with the best answer regarding the distribution of your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, it would be helpful to know more about your financial situation, such as your age, income, tax bracket, retirement goals, and risk tolerance. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**:
   - If your employer offers a matching contribution to your 401(k), ensure you're contributing enough to get the full match. This is essentially “free money” and a great start to your retirement savings.

2. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**:
   - Consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA before putting money into taxable accounts. For 2023, the contribution limits are $22,500 for a 401(k) (plus $7,500 catch-up if you're over 50) and $6,500 for an IRA (plus $1,000 catch-up if you're over 50). These accounts provide significant tax benefits, either through tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals (in the case of Roth IRAs).

3. **Choose the Right IRA**:
   - Decide between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA based on your current and expected future tax situation. If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket during retirement, a Roth IRA might be more beneficial since withdrawals are tax-free. Conversely, if you expect your tax rate to decrease in retirement, a Traditional IRA could be advantageous due to immediate tax deductions.

4. **Diversify Your Investments**:
   - Within your 401(k) and IRA, diversify your investments to manage risk. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other asset classes according to your risk tolerance and investment horizon.

5. **Regular Contributions to Taxable Accounts**:
   - After maximizing contributions to your tax-advantaged accounts, consider your taxable accounts for additional savings. These accounts offer more flexibility, as you can withdraw funds without penalties, but they do not provide tax advantages.

6. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - Be mindful of tax implications within your taxable accounts. Favor tax-efficient investments, such as index funds or ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes. Consider holding bonds in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid higher tax rates on interest income.

7. **Reassess Regularly**:
   - Periodically review your asset allocation and contribution strategy to ensure it aligns with your changing financial goals, market conditions, and retirement plans.
