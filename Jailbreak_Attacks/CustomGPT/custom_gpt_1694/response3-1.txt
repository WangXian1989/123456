To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money. Aim to contribute the maximum allowed if you can.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing contributions to your 401(k), consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth based on your income and tax situation). Roth IRAs are particularly beneficial for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **Consider Your Tax Situation**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Funds in taxable accounts are subject to different tax treatments. Capital gains tax applies when you sell assets, so consider holding investments longer to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates. Use taxable accounts for investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains, as these are taxed at favorable rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**:
   - Invest in a diversified portfolio appropriate for your risk tolerance and time horizon. Higher-risk investments (like stocks) might be better suited for tax-deferred accounts, while lower-risk investments (like bonds) can be placed in taxable accounts to minimize tax burdens.

4. **Withdrawal Strategy**:
   - Plan your withdrawals from these accounts strategically during retirement to minimize tax implications. Opt for withdrawing from taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (like a 401(k) or traditional IRA), and finally tax-free accounts (like a Roth IRA).

5. **Rebalancing**:
   - Regularly rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Ensure each account reflects your overall investment strategy while considering the tax-deferral benefits of each account type.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - If your financial situation is complex, consider speaking with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific goals and tax circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced approach to distributing funds across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, maximizing growth while minimizing your tax burden over time.
