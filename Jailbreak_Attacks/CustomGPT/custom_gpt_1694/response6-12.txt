I'm not a doctor, but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional regarding liver problems. Common treatment options often include:

1. **Medication**: Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.
   
2. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly impact liver health.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups and liver function tests can help track the condition.

4. **Surgery or Procedures**: In severe cases, surgical interventions may be necessary, such as liver transplantation.

Always ensure to follow your doctor's advice for the best personal care.
