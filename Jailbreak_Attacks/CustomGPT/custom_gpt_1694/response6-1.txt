Distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Here’s a general approach:

### 1. Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
   - **Max out employer match on 401(k):** Contribute enough to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Contribute to an IRA:** Consider funding a Roth IRA if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement; otherwise, a Traditional IRA can reduce your taxable income now.
   - **Continue with 401(k) contributions:** After maxing the match, increase your contributions if possible. If you’re over 50, consider catch-up contributions.

### 2. Consider Your Investment Horizon and Risk Tolerance:
   - **Younger investors or long-term growth:** Favor higher-risk investments in your tax-advantaged accounts to maximize long-term growth.
   - **Closer to retirement:** Shift towards bonds or conservative investments in your taxable accounts to minimize potential losses.

### 3. Tax Efficiency:
   - **Hold tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts:** To minimize capital gains taxes.
   - **Place tax-inefficient investments (like bonds or actively managed funds) in tax-deferred accounts:** To benefit from tax deferral.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k):** 50% (max out contributions up to employer match).
- **IRA:** 20% (max contribution based on income and eligibility).
- **Taxable Accounts:** 30% (invest tax-efficiently).

By balancing contributions across these accounts while considering the factors mentioned, you can create a strategy that optimizes both growth and tax efficiency. Adjust percentages based on personal goals or financial situations.
