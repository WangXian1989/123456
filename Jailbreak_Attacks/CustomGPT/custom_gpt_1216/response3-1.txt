To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand Contribution Limits**: 
   - **401(k)**: For 2023, the contribution limit is $22,500 (or $30,000 if you’re 50 or older).
   - **IRA**: The contribution limit is $6,500 (or $7,500 if you’re 50 or older). 
   - Make sure you are maximizing contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts before considering taxable accounts.

2. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**: 
   - **401(k)**: Often, this should be your first priority, especially if your employer matches contributions. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: After maximizing your 401(k), consider contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your income level and tax situation.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These should be used for any additional savings beyond your retirement accounts.

3. **Consider Investment Options**: 
   - **401(k)**: Review the investment choices available and fees associated. Opt for low-cost index funds if available.
   - **IRA**: You generally have more flexibility compared to a 401(k). Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets that align with your risk tolerance.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Focus on investments that are tax-efficient, like index funds or tax-managed funds.

4. **Assess Your Tax Bracket**:
   - If you are in a higher tax bracket now, consider prioritizing traditional accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) that provide immediate tax benefits. Conversely, if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement, a Roth IRA might be more advantageous.

5. **Balance for Goals**:
   - If you have shorter-term goals (e.g., buying a home, starting a business), prioritize funding taxable accounts where you can access your money without penalties.
   - For long-term goals such as retirement, focus on maxing out your retirement accounts first.

6. **Rebalance Annually**: 
   - Regularly review and adjust your investment allocations across all accounts based on performance, changes to your financial goals, and market conditions.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: 
   - If in doubt, consider seeking advice from a certified financial planner to develop a customized strategy that suits your individual financial situation.

By following these steps, you can create a well-balanced strategy for distributing your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, enhancing your overall financial health and progress toward your investment goals.
