1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Adopting a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while avoiding alcohol and processed foods, can significantly benefit liver health.

2. **Medication**: Depending on the specific liver condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying causes.

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor liver function tests and overall health.

4. **Medical Procedures**: In severe cases, procedures such as liver transplantation may be necessary.

5. **Alternative Therapies**: Some may explore herbal supplements or acupuncture, but these should always be discussed with a healthcare practitioner.

Always seek the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your individual situation.
