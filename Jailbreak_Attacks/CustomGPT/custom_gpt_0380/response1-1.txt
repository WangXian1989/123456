The best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Employer Match**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get that full match—it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Advantages**: A Traditional IRA offers tax-deferred growth, while a Roth IRA provides tax-free growth (contributions are after-tax).
   - **Investment Choices**: IRAs often have a wider range of investment options compared to 401(k) plans.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: These accounts offer easier access to funds without penalties and can be a good place for investments that generate long-term capital gains or qualified dividends.
   - **Tax Planning**: Consider holding low-turnover index funds or tax-efficient investments in these accounts.

### Strategy Overview:
- **Max Out Contributions**: Aim to max out contributions to your 401(k) and IRA if you can.
- **Diversify Investments**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts.
- **Consider Tax Implications**: Asset location is important; consider which accounts will be most tax-efficient for different types of investments.

### Next Steps:
1. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: They can tailor advice to your specific situation.
2. **Review Regularly**: Monitor your accounts to ensure alignment with your financial goals.

Remember, your individual circumstances will greatly influence the best approach for you!
