(α) To effectively target young voters, consider these strategies: 

1. **Leverage Social Media:** Utilize platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat where young people are most active. Create engaging and relatable content that resonates with their values and interests.

2. **Focus on Issues that Matter:** Address social issues important to youth, such as climate change, education affordability, and social justice. Tailor your messaging to show how these issues directly impact their lives.
