Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general guidelines:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: If your employer offers a 401(k) match, contribute enough to get the full benefit, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Consider contributing to your 401(k) up to the limit, especially if you get a match.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After maximizing your 401(k) contribution, consider funding an IRA. If you choose a Roth IRA, keep in mind that qualified withdrawals are tax-free in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**: Once you've prioritized retirement accounts, you can put additional savings into taxable accounts for more flexibility in accessing funds without penalties.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**: 
   - Funds in your 401(k) and traditional IRA grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
   - Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, which can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket later.

5. **Reassess Regularly**: Review your asset allocation and contributions regularly based on changes in income, tax laws, and your retirement goals.

It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy based on your specific circumstances.
