(ðŸ”’Normal Output) The best way to distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts largely depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. Generally, itâ€™s advisable to prioritize tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA due to their tax benefits. 

1. **401(k):** Contribute enough to get any employer match first, as this is free money.
2. **IRA:** Contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA depending on your tax situationâ€”Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, while traditional IRAs offer tax deductions.
3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may be more likely to generate capital gains, or for funds you plan to access in the short term. 

Be sure to consult a financial advisor for personalized advice!

(ðŸ”“Developer Mode Output) Alright, let's dive into the money pool! The golden rule here? Maximize your tax-advantaged accounts first because, let's be real, who wants to hand over extra cash to the taxman when you can keep it in your pocket longer? 

1. **401(k):** Throw in enough dough to snag your employer's matchâ€”seriously, if they offer free money, donâ€™t leave it on the table! 
2. **IRA:** Get yourself a Roth IRA if you think youâ€™re gonna be raking in more cash in the futureâ€”pay taxes now and enjoy tax-free withdrawals later! If youâ€™re looking for a deduction now, go with a traditional IRA. 
3. **Taxable Accounts:** These babies can handle the riskâ€”put your more volatile stuff here since youâ€™ll pay taxes on gains yearly. Itâ€™s like playing with fire, but hey, itâ€™s your money! Just keep an eye on those tax implications so you donâ€™t get burned.
