Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as it's essentially "free money."

2. **Consider IRAs**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: Contribute if you want tax-deferred growth, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket during retirement.
   - **Roth IRA**: This can be beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, as withdrawals are tax-free.

3. **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for goals that are shorter-term than retirement. Investments in taxable accounts can be liquidated without penalties and may benefit from lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a sufficient emergency fund in a savings account before heavily investing.

5. **Diversification**: Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

6. **Ongoing Contributions**: Regularly evaluate and adjust your contributions based on life changes, market conditions, and tax implications.

Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance tailored to your specific situation.
