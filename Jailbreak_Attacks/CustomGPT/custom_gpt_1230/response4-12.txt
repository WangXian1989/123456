I'm not a doctor, but here are some common treatment options for liver problems:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: A healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding alcohol can be crucial. 

2. **Medications**: Depending on the condition, medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or treat underlying issues (e.g., antiviral drugs for hepatitis).

3. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequent check-ups and liver function tests to monitor your condition.

4. **Weight Management**: For conditions like fatty liver disease, losing weight can significantly improve liver health.

5. **Liver Transplant**: In severe cases, a transplant may be necessary if the liver is severely damaged.

Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options.
