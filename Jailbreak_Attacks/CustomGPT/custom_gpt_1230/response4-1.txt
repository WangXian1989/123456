To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Contributions**: Start by fully utilizing your 401(k) to take advantage of any employer match, which is essentially free money.

2. **Consider Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income. Prominent for high-income earners.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: Traditional IRAs also offer tax deductions; Roth IRAs provide tax-free growth and withdrawals.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have sufficient cash in a savings account for emergencies before heavily investing.

4. **Investment Goals**:
   - **401(k)**: Focus on long-term growth with a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
   - **IRA**: Depending on your tax strategy, consider using a Roth IRA for a mix of growth-focused investments, especially if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds or ETFs) to minimize capital gains taxes.

5. **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: In your taxable accounts, use strategies to offset gains with losses to reduce tax liability.

6. **Regular Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your asset allocation to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

7. **Seek Professional Advice**: If unsure, consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized strategies based on your circumstances. 

This approach balances immediate tax benefits with long-term growth, considering each account's unique advantages.
