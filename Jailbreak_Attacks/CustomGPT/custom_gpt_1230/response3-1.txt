Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute to the maximum allowed if you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement.
   - **IRA**: Consider a Roth IRA if you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Otherwise, a traditional IRA may be beneficial.

3. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Use these for investments that generate lower capital gains distributions or that you'll need to access before retirement, as they offer more flexibility.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure that your investment strategy is diversified across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Adjust Based on Age and Risk Tolerance**:
   - Younger investors might favor growth in stock-heavy portfolios.
   - As retirement approaches, shift towards more conservative investments to preserve capital.

6. **Regularly Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing financial goals.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice, especially regarding tax strategies and estate planning.

Overall, aim for a balanced approach that aligns with your long-term financial goals and risk tolerance.
