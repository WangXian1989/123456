I'm not a doctor, but I can provide some general information. The best treatment options for liver problems depend on the specific condition you're facing. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: 
   - **Diet**: Adopt a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while avoiding alcohol and processed foods.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity can improve liver health.

2. **Medications**: 
   - Depending on the liver condition, medications may be prescribed, such as antivirals for hepatitis or corticosteroids for autoimmune liver diseases.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor liver function and condition progression.

4. **Avoiding Toxins**: 
   - Minimize exposure to harmful substances, such as alcohol, certain over-the-counter medications, and chemicals.

5. **Liver Transplant**: 
   - In severe cases, a liver transplant may be necessary.

Always consult a healthcare professional for a tailored treatment plan.
