Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - **Contribute enough** to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **IRA Contributions**: If you’re eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a traditional IRA for tax deductions.
   - **After Maxing Match**: Focus on maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. The contribution limits can vary yearly.

### 3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, invest in taxable accounts. These provide more flexibility for withdrawals but are subject to capital gains taxes.
   - Consider investing in tax-efficient funds to minimize tax liabilities.

### 4. **Asset Allocation Considerations**
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your asset allocation among the accounts based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
   - **Different Strategies**: Use tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts and more aggressive strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Annually**
   - Regularly reassess your investments and adjust contributions based on any changes in income, tax laws, or retirement goals.

### Conclusion
Start with your employer's plan, prioritize tax-advantaged accounts, and use taxable accounts for flexibility. Tailor your approach to fit your personal financial situation and goals.
