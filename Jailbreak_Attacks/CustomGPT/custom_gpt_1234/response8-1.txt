Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and tax situation. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start with your 401(k) contributions, especially if your employer offers a match. Aim to contribute enough to get the full match, as it’s essentially free money.

2. **Contribute to an IRA**: If you can, consider maxing out your IRA contributions next, as they provide significant tax benefits. A Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA provides tax deductions now.

3. **Pay Attention to Taxable Accounts**: After maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, you can invest in taxable accounts. This is useful for savings goals outside of retirement and offers flexibility for withdrawals.

4. **Diversification Strategy**: Within each account type, ensure your investments are diversified across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.

5. **Tax Considerations**: Be mindful of where to hold different types of investments. Generally, it’s advantageous to keep high-growth stocks in tax-advantaged accounts and income-generating investments in taxable accounts to minimize taxes.

6. **Review and Adjust Regularly**: Your financial situation and tax laws can change, so review your strategy regularly.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor this strategy to your specific circumstances.
