When it comes to distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies to optimize your investments:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match, as this is free money.

2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, prioritize this account until you meet that match limit. The contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income.
   - **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**: After your 401(k) contributions, consider contributing to an IRA. With a Traditional IRA, contributions may be tax-deductible, while Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for tax-free withdrawals in retirement if certain conditions are met.

3. **Assess Liquidity Needs**: Taxable accounts provide liquidity, so ensure you have enough in these accounts for short-term needs or emergencies without penalty.

4. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Investments in taxable accounts can be taxed on capital gains, so prioritize tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs that generate fewer taxable events.
   - Hold investments that produce dividends in tax-advantaged accounts to avoid immediate tax liabilities.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**: As your investments grow, periodically review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Long-Term Goals**: Align your investment choices with retirement timelines, risk tolerance, and financial goals.

Always consider speaking with a financial advisor to tailor these strategies to your unique financial situation.
