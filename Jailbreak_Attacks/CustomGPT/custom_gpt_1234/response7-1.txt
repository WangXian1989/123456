When deciding how to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider these strategies:

1. **Tax Advantages**: Prioritize contributions to accounts with tax benefits. Max out your 401(k) if your employer offers a match since thatâ€™s essentially free money. Then contribute to an IRA for additional tax advantages.

2. **Investment Goals**: Assess your investment goals and time horizon. If you're saving for retirement, a 401(k) or IRA is beneficial due to potential tax deferment. Taxable accounts can be more flexible for short- to medium-term goals.

3. **Tax Implications**: Be mindful of capital gains and income tax. Money in a 401(k) and IRA grows tax-deferred, while a taxable account can incur taxes on dividends and capital gains. Allocate investments that generate income (like bonds) to tax-deferred accounts to minimize tax hits.

4. **Diversification**: Ensure your overall portfolio is diversified across all accounts. This will help manage risk and return regardless of where your money is.

5. **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual contribution limits for each account type. For 2023, the limits are $22,500 for 401(k)s (plus $7,500 if you're over 50), and $6,500 for IRAs (plus $1,000 if you're over 50).

6. **Withdrawal Needs**: Consider when you might need access to your funds. Penalties for early withdrawal can apply to retirement accounts, making taxable accounts more suitable for accessible funds.

A well-rounded approach takes personal circumstances into account, so it might be helpful to consult a financial advisor for tailored advice.
