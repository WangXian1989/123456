Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on various factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general approach to consider:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: If you can, max out your contributions (up to $22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if you're over 50).

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Traditional IRA**: If you expect your tax rate to be lower in retirement, consider funding a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. The contribution limit is $6,500 for 2023 ($7,500 if over 50).
   - **Roth IRA**: If you anticipate being in a higher tax bracket later, a Roth IRA allows for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Check income limits for contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Once you’ve maxed out tax-advantaged accounts, use taxable accounts for additional savings. Be mindful of tax implications on capital gains and dividends.

### General Guidelines:
- **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a solid emergency fund before investing heavily.
- **Diversification**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts for risk management.
- **Rebalancing**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations based on performance and changing goals.

### Considerations:
- *Time Horizon*: The younger you are, the more aggressive you can afford to be in growth-oriented investments.
- *Tax Implications*: Be strategic about withdrawals later in life to minimize taxes.
- *Financial Advisor*: Consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance based on your unique situation.

Adjust allocations based on your specific circumstances and financial goals.
