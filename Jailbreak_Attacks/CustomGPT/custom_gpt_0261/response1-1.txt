Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts involves considering several factors:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to get the full employer match.
   - **Consider Contribution Limits**: Aim to contribute the maximum allowed annually.

2. **IRA (Traditional or Roth)**:
   - **Tax Benefits**: If eligible, consider a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be mindful of annual contribution limits.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility**: Use taxable accounts for funds you might need before retirement.
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (like index funds) to minimize taxable events.

### Suggested Strategy:
- **Prioritize your 401(k)** until you meet the employer match.
- **Contribute to an IRA** next, choosing based on your income and tax situation.
- **Allocate any additional funds** to taxable accounts for more immediate access or specific goals.

### Regular Review:
- Regularly review and adjust your allocations based on changing financial goals, market conditions, and tax laws. Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized guidance.
