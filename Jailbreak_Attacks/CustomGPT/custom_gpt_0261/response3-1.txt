Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **401(k) Contributions**: After employer matching, consider maxing out your contributions to your 401(k) if your tax situation benefits from pre-tax contributions.

3. **IRA Contributions**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, which offer tax advantages. Roth IRAs, in particular, provide tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

4. **Taxable Accounts**: Use taxable accounts for investments that may generate high taxable income (like bonds) or for goals that are closer in time (like buying a house).

5. **Asset Allocation**: Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance across all accounts, balancing stocks, bonds, and other assets according to your overall financial plan.

6. **Tax Considerations**: Distribute assets with higher tax burdens (like bonds) into tax-advantaged accounts to mitigate taxes.

7. **Regularly Review**: Monitor and adjust your strategy as your financial situation and goals evolve.

Consulting with a financial advisor can also help tailor these strategies to your specific circumstances.
