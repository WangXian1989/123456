To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - **Maximize Employer Match**: Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions reduce your taxable income. Consider maxing out contributions if youâ€™re in a high tax bracket.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - **Roth vs. Traditional**: Choose based on your current vs. expected future tax situation. A Roth IRA grows tax-free, while Traditional IRAs may provide immediate tax benefits.
   - **Contribution Limits**: Be aware of annual limits and deadlines for contributions.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Flexibility and Accessibility**: Use these for short-term goals or emergencies, as they allow for easier access to funds without penalties.
   - **Tax-Efficient Investments**: Focus on tax-efficient investments, such as index funds and ETFs, to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Asset Allocation**:
   - **Risk Tolerance**: Adjust your investments based on your risk tolerance across all accounts. Higher-risk investments may be better suited for tax-advantaged accounts where gains can grow untaxed longer.
   - **Diversification**: Ensure a diversified investment mix across all accounts to reduce risks.

5. **Regular Review**:
   - **Rebalance Periodically**: Monitor your portfolio and rebalance based on market conditions and changes in your financial goals.

Overall, balancing contributions based on tax implications, investment options, and personal goals will help you optimize your investment strategy.
