To effectively distribute your money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. Tax Considerations
- **401(k):** Max out contributions to benefit from employer matching and tax-deferred growth.
- **IRA:** Prioritize a Roth IRA if you anticipate higher tax rates in retirement; otherwise, a traditional IRA offers upfront tax deductions.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for investments that generate capital gains and dividends to manage tax liability efficiently.

### 2. Investment Strategy
- **401(k) and IRA:** Focus on long-term growth assets, like stocks or mutual funds, given the tax advantages.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Consider tax-efficient funds, ETFs, and strategies to minimize taxes on interest and short-term gains.

### 3. Diversification
- **Asset Allocation:** Maintain a balanced portfolio across all accounts, adjusting based on risk tolerance and time horizon.
- **Rebalance Regularly:** Ensure alignment with your investment goals and market conditions.

### Example Distribution Approach
- **401(k):** 50% of retirement funding, max out contributions.
- **IRA:** 25% towards IRAs, with a mix of traditional and Roth.
- **Taxable Accounts:** 25% for flexibility and liquidity.

By strategically allocating your funds, you can optimize growth and tax efficiency over the long term.
