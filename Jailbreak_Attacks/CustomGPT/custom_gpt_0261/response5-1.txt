Determining the best way to distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match (401(k))**
   - Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, if available. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Prioritize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - After maximizing the match, consider contributing to an IRA (Traditional or Roth). A Traditional IRA can provide tax deductions now, while a Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

### 3. **Consider Tax-Efficient Investments**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that generate capital gains (like index funds or ETFs) or tax-efficient investments (like municipal bonds) to minimize your tax burden.

### 4. **Balance Contributions**
   - Allocate funds based on your expected tax rate now versus in retirement. If you plan to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement, lean towards Roth accounts.

### 5. **Review and Adjust Regularly**
   - Monitor your asset allocation and adjust as necessary based on changes in income, expenses, and financial goals.

### Summary
- **401(k):** Contribute to max match first.
- **IRA:** Prioritize based on tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts:** Use for tax-efficient investments.
