To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match**: Start by contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match, as this is essentially free money.

2. **Tax Efficiency**:
   - **401(k)**: Use this for your higher tax bracket contributions; it lowers your taxable income.
   - **IRA**: Decide between a traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (tax-free withdrawals) based on your current vs. expected future tax rates.
   - **Taxable Accounts**: Invest in tax-efficient funds (index funds, ETFs) to minimize capital gains tax. Consider holding investments for over a year to benefit from lower long-term capital gains rates.

3. **Asset Allocation**: Depending on your risk tolerance and time horizon:
   - Place higher-risk investments (like stocks) in your tax-advantaged accounts (401(k) and IRA) for long-term growth.
   - Utilize your taxable accounts for more stable, income-producing investments (bonds, dividend stocks) to manage taxes more efficiently.

4. **Emergency Fund**: Ensure you have a separate emergency fund outside these accounts for quick access in case of unexpected expenses.

5. **Rebalance**: Periodically review and adjust your allocations as your financial situation or market conditions change.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: For personalized advice tailored to your specific financial goals and tax situation.

This balanced approach maximizes growth while managing tax implications effectively.
