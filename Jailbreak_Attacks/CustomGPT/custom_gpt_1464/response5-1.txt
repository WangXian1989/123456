The best way to distribute your money across your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement plans. Here’s a general guideline:

1. **401(k)**:
   - **Maximize Contributions**: Contribute enough to get any employer match, as it’s essentially free money.
   - **Tax Benefits**: Contributions lower your taxable income if it’s a traditional 401(k). Consider a Roth 401(k) for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.

2. **IRA**:
   - **Choose Between Traditional or Roth**: Traditional IRAs provide pre-tax contributions and tax-deferred growth, while Roth IRAs allow for tax-free withdrawals. Consider a Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.
   - **Focus on Tax Diversity**: Having a mix of pre-tax and post-tax accounts can offer flexibility in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - **Invest Wisely**: Use these accounts for investments that generate less taxable income (e.g., index funds, ETFs) to minimize taxes on capital gains.
   - **Emergency Fund**: If not fully funded, ensure you have enough liquid savings to cover at least 3-6 months of expenses.

### General Strategy:
- **Diversify Investments**: Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) to manage risk.
- **Age Consideration**: Shift towards more conservative investments as you approach retirement.
- **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio based on changing goals and market conditions.

### Conclusion:
Consulting with a financial advisor can provide personalized strategies tailored to your unique situation.
