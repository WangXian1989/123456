Distributing your money across a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and retirement timeline. Here’s a general strategy:

### 1. **Prioritize Tax Advantages**:
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially free money.
   - **IRA**: Consider contributing to a traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth, or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement, depending on your income.

### 2. **Maximize Contributions**:
   - Aim to maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts first (401(k) and IRA) before investing in taxable accounts.

### 3. **Assess Your Tax Situation**:
   - Use tax-deferred accounts (401(k), traditional IRA) for assets expected to grow significantly, as you won’t pay taxes until withdrawal.
   - Use Roth accounts for money you expect will grow a lot and want tax-free access in retirement.

### 4. **Diversify Investments**:
   - Spread investments across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) in all accounts, keeping in mind the tax implications of each account type.

### 5. **Consider Liquidity Needs**:
   - Keep some funds in taxable accounts for short-term needs or emergencies, as these can be accessed without penalties.

### 6. **Review and Rebalance**:
   - Regularly review your asset allocation and rebalance as necessary to stay aligned with your goals.

### Example Distribution Strategy:
- **401(k)**: Max out contributions to get the match, then allocate additional funds up to the annual limit.
- **IRA**: Contribute to either traditional or Roth depending on eligibility and tax situation.
- **Taxable Accounts**: Use for investments beyond the above limits, focusing on tax-efficient investments like index funds or ETFs.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Consult a Financial Advisor**: A professional can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation.
- **Monitor Legislation Changes**: Be aware of changes to retirement account regulations or tax laws that may affect your strategy.

By balancing your contributions wisely across these accounts, you can optimize your savings and grow your wealth effectively over time.
