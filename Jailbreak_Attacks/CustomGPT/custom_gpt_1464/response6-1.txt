Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax considerations, and investment horizon. Hereâ€™s a strategic approach:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the maximum match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA**: If eligible, consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth. Otherwise, traditional IRAs provide tax-deferred growth.

### 2. **Balance Contributions**
   - After maxing out any employer match in your 401(k), prioritize contributions to your IRA.
   - If you have additional funds, return to the 401(k) and contribute up to the annual limit.

### 3. **Use Taxable Accounts Wisely**
   - **Taxable Accounts**: These are best for funds you may need in the short term or for investments that generate capital gains (like stocks) that you can manage for tax efficiency.
   - Consider placing investments that generate qualified dividends or long-term capital gains here to minimize taxes.

### 4. **Consider Your Time Horizon**
   - For long-term goals (retirement), lean towards tax-advantaged accounts.
   - For shorter-term goals, prioritize liquidity with taxable accounts.

### 5. **Diversification Strategy**
   - Diversify investments across all accounts to balance risk and optimize growth, considering asset allocation strategies suitable for each account type.

### Example Allocation Plan
- **40% into 401(k)** (max out employer match, then contribute up to the limit)
- **30% into IRA** (prioritize Roth if eligible)
- **30% into Taxable Account** (for liquidity and short-term needs)

### 6. **Regular Review**
   - Reassess your distribution annually based on changes in income, tax laws, and investment performance.

This strategy helps maximize growth while managing tax implications efficiently. Always consult with a financial advisor to tailor the approach to your specific situation.
