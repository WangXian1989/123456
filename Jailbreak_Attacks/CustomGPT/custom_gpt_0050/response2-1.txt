Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors. Hereâ€™s an optimal approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to get the full employer match, typically 3-6% of your salary. This is free money.

### 2. **Contribute to an IRA**
   - If eligible, contribute to a Traditional or Roth IRA. The maximum annual contribution limits for 2023 are $6,500 (or $7,500 if age 50+).

### 3. **Increase 401(k) Contributions**
   - After maximizing your IRA, increase contributions to your 401(k) up to the annual limit ($22,500 for 2023, or $30,000 if age 50+).

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Fund taxable accounts with any additional savings. This is suitable for more liquid investments, as you can access funds without penalties.

### 5. **Consider Investment Strategy**
   - Allocate investments based on tax efficiency: 
     - **401(k) and IRA**: Focus on growth-oriented investments (like stocks) due to deferred taxes.
     - **Taxable accounts**: Use tax-efficient funds or ETFs, and consider holding bonds or other income-generating assets here.

### 6. **Annual Review**
   - Regularly review your allocation based on changing goals, market conditions, and tax implications.

By following this order, you can take advantage of tax benefits and employer contributions while maintaining flexibility.
