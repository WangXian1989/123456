Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively involves a few key strategies:

1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:
   - **401(k)**: Contribute enough to get any employer match; this is essentially free money. Consider maxing out if you're in a high tax bracket, as it reduces taxable income.
   - **IRA**: If eligible, contribute to a traditional or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA allows tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, while a traditional IRA may provide immediate tax benefits.

2. **Assess Your Investment Goals**:
   - Consider your time horizon, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs. Long-term investments can be focused in tax-advantaged accounts, while short-term needs might be better suited for taxable accounts.

3. **Taxable Accounts for Flexibility**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement, such as emergency funds or specific savings goals. Be mindful of capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Diversify across asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) and sectors within each account type to mitigate risk.

5. **Rebalance Regularly**:
   - Regularly review and adjust your portfolio based on performance and changing goals. Maintain the desired asset allocation across all accounts.

6. **Consider Tax Implications**:
   - Withdrawals from traditional accounts are taxed as income. Plan your withdrawals strategically in retirement to minimize taxes.

7. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Personalized advice can help tailor strategies specifically to your financial situation and goals.

By following these principles, you can create a balanced and effective distribution strategy for your investments.
