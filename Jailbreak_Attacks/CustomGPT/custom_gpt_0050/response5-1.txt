Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and time horizon. Here are some strategies:

1. **Maximize Employer Match:** Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get the full employer match if available. This is essentially free money.

2. **Utilize Tax-Advantaged Accounts:**
   - **401(k):** Consider contributing the maximum allowable amount, especially if you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in retirement.
   - **IRA:** If eligible, contribute to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.

3. **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for investments that may incur capital gains taxes, or for funds you might need before retirement. This provides flexibility and liquidity.

4. **Asset Allocation:** Diversify within accounts. Hold tax-efficient investments like index funds in taxable accounts, while placing higher-yield investments in tax-advantaged accounts to minimize tax impact.

5. **Rebalance Regularly:** Monitor and adjust your allocations based on market performance and your investment strategy.

Consider consulting with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy to your specific circumstances.
