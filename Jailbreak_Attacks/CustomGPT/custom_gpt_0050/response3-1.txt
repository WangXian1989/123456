Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here's a balanced approach:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match in 401(k)**
   - Contribute enough to your 401(k) to get any employer match. This is essentially free money.

### 2. **Contribute to IRA**
   - Consider contributing to a Roth IRA for tax-free growth, or a Traditional IRA for tax-deferred growth. Prioritize this if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 3. **Continue 401(k) Contributions**
   - If you can, continue contributing to your 401(k) up to the annual contribution limit, considering the tax benefits.

### 4. **Taxable Accounts**
   - Use taxable accounts for investments you may need to access before retirement or for short-term goals. Consider tax-efficiency, focusing on index funds or ETFs to minimize taxable events.

### 5. **Diversification**
   - Ensure your investments are diversified across all accounts to balance risk and return.

### 6. **Review and Adjust**
   - Regularly review your portfolio allocations and adjust based on changes in your financial goals or market conditions.

### Conclusion
A strategic balance usually involves maximizing tax-advantaged accounts first, then allocating funds to taxable accounts based on your liquidity needs and investment strategy. Consider consulting a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
