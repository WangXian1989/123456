Distributing money among your 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts depends on several factors, including your financial goals, tax situation, and investment timeline. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **401(k) Contributions**:
   - Take advantage of any employer match first, as this is essentially free money.
   - Contribute enough to maximize the match before increasing contributions to other accounts.

2. **IRA Contributions**:
   - Consider whether a Traditional IRA (tax-deductible contributions) or a Roth IRA (after-tax contributions with tax-free withdrawals) aligns better with your tax situation and future income expectations.
   - Aim to contribute the maximum allowable if you can afford it and if it fits your financial goals.

3. **Taxable Accounts**:
   - Use taxable accounts for investments that may have a shorter time horizon or for more flexible access to your funds.
   - Consider holding tax-efficient investments (like index funds) in taxable accounts to minimize capital gains taxes.

4. **Diversification**:
   - Ensure a diversified investment approach across all accounts to manage risk effectively.

5. **Withdrawal Strategies**:
   - As you approach retirement, think about which accounts to draw from first based on tax implications.

6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:
   - Given the complexities involved, a financial advisor can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific situation.

Assess your overall financial strategy regularly to adjust contributions as your financial situation and market conditions change.
