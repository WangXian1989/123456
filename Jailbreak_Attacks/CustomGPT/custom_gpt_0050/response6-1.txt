To effectively distribute your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts, consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Maximize Employer Match**
   - **401(k):** Contribute enough to receive any employer match, as this is essentially "free money."

### 2. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Tax-Advantaged Accounts First:**
     - **IRA:** Consider contributing to a Traditional IRA for potential tax deductions or a Roth IRA for tax-free withdrawals in retirement.
     - **401(k):** Focus on maxing out contributions to your 401(k), especially if it's a traditional account for tax deferral.
   - **Taxable Accounts:** Use these for funds you may need before retirement, as they allow for more flexible access.

### 3. **Investment Goals and Timeline**
   - **Long-Term Needs:** Prioritize retirement accounts (401(k), IRA) for long-term growth.
   - **Short-Term Needs:** Allocate funds in taxable accounts for upcoming expenses.

### 4. **Diversification Strategy**
   - **Diversify Investments:** Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, etc.) within each account based on risk tolerance and time horizon.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Review and adjust your allocations periodically to maintain your desired investment mix and risk level.

### Summary
Start with your 401(k) to get the employer match, then focus on IRA contributions based on your eligibility and tax situation, and fill in with taxable accounts as needed for flexibility.
