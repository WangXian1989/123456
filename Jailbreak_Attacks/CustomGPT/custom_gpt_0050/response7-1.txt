Distributing your money among a 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts effectively depends on your financial goals, tax situation, and investment strategy. Hereâ€™s a general guideline:

### 1. **Maximize Tax-Advantaged Accounts First**
   - **401(k)**: If your employer offers a match, contribute enough to get the full match. This is essentially "free money."
   - **IRA/Roth IRA**: Contribute to an IRA, prioritizing a Roth IRA if you're eligible and expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

### 2. **Evaluate Your Tax Situation**
   - Consider your current vs. expected future tax rates. Tax-deferred accounts (401(k) and traditional IRA) are beneficial if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket during retirement.

### 3. **Diversify Across Accounts**
   - Maintain a diversified portfolio across all accounts. Ensure you're not overly concentrated in one type of investment.

### 4. **Consider Withdrawals and Timing**
   - Plan for how and when you might need to withdraw funds. Taxable accounts can provide more flexibility for withdrawals without penalties.

### 5. **Rebalance Regularly**
   - Monitor and rebalance your investments to maintain your desired asset allocation, accounting for growth and changing risk tolerance.

### 6. **Consult a Financial Advisor**
   - If you're unsure, a financial advisor can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

By following these steps, you can create a balanced, tax-efficient investment strategy that aligns with your long-term financial goals.
